764|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar1|Marth|What is this strange air? It feels like it's full of evil spirits.|
765|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar1|Jagen|That is true... My body appears to be frozen. These are the evil spirits of the Earth Dragons. Your highness, it seems we can't have everybody enter ahead. Since we don't know what will happen, please choose carefully who to take with you.|
766|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar1|Marth|I hope to at least take the people who are worried about the four sisters.|
767|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar1|Jagen|Mmm... There's no avoiding that. But how many people will survive? I bet this will be a fierce battle.|
768|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar1|Gotoh|Prince Marth. The altar is probably full of crazed barbarians and Mage Dragons that have lost their mind. They are being controlled by Gharnef's magic, and will definitely attack you. The dark priests that serve Gharnef also have fearful power. As this battle lengthens it will become fiercer, but don't stop and keep charging forwards! You must defeat Gharnef, and recover from him the divine Falchion sword that was stolen from Altea. Without the Falchion, you won't be able to defeat Medeus...|
769|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar1|Jagen|Your highness, the wall in front of us has collapsed!|
770|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|Princess Sheena, it seems the Altean army has arrived.|
771|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheena|Really...? It's already the end. Samson, I have brought you much trouble. I need to watch the final days of my Kingdom of Gra. You may leave now.|
772|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|Princess, isn't it already enough? Shouldn't you despise King Jiol for forcefully taking your mother? Isn't that why you hid at Millennium Court and stayed away from this country? Right now you are just being tricked by Hardin, and being used by him.|
773|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheena|Perhaps. I heard that the people of Gra wished for the restoration of the country, and that's why I agreed to help him. However Hardin is only interested in using us. He would just throw us away like rubbish the moment we became useless to him. Still, I will not leave! How can I just abandon those fighting for my sake!?|
774|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|Impossible... How can our fresh recruits resist Altea's elites...? Fine, if you're staying, I will also stay to the end. This could be interesting.|
775|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheena|Samson... Why are you doing this? Aren't you mercenaries only interested in being paid with gold? I no longer have money to give you...|
776|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|I don't know why either. It's just... Sometimes men feel like there are things that they must do. Also, I want to see how that kid fights this battle. If he truly is a hero, perhaps your mind may be changed...|
777|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Old Man|Hardin sent troops here to prevent Gra from rebelling. The Archanea soldiers are the only ones that can still fight.|
778|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Woman|Princess Sheena is the child of King Jiol's second wife. But, she is different from the king. She is a very kind person. The princess is prepared to sacrifice her life for her soldiers. Is there no way to save her?|
779|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Woman|The soldiers here are all foreigners. There's nobody else to protect this country, because the knights of this country all died. Right now, the actions of the Archanea soldiers are deplorable. Their just the same as thieves... Those lowlifes!|
780|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Young Woman|Ah... Please leave me. I already have nothing to give you.|
781|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Marth|Ah, please don't get us wrong. We aren't here to steal.|
782|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Young Woman|But, didn't you all come here from Altea for revenge?|
783|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Marth|No, we don't want to fight Gra, because Gra and Altea were originally like one family.|
784|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Young Woman|Is that true...? Then, I will give my most important treasure... to... you|
785|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheena|You... You dare treat my citizens like that... Die!|
786|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheena|Forgive me, citizens of Gra.|
787|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|Prince Marth... I thought you were a noble person, but you're just a murderer... You disappoint me.*|
788|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|Sheena...|
789|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Marth|You are Princess Sheena? It's great to see you safe. I don't view Gra as an enemy. Gra and my country were originally one country. The country may have divided after Anri's death, but we always got on well as allies. But, in the previous war, I felt deeply regretful about things turning out the way they did. Princess Sheena, please allow us to be friends once again. I don't want to fight Gra.|
790|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheena|Prince Marth... Once I heard that you didn't attack my fleeing soldiers, I was really surprised. You truly are the second coming of King Anri. I trust you. Please... Treat the citizens of Gra... as if they were your citizens. I will hand my whole country to your care... Prince Marth.|
791|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|That's great Sheena. Now I can finally leave without worry.|
792|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheena|Samson... Can you not leave...?|
793|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|You don't need me anymore. From now on Prince Marth will protect you.|
794|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheena|Don't leave! I don't want you to leave...|
795|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|Huh, what? Why keep me? It doesn't seem like you. ...Fine. If you say you need me, I won't go anywhere else. I will protect you wherever you may go. Is that fine with you?|
796|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheena|Yes...|
797|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Jagen|Lord Marth, if this battle continues it will become meaningless, and will only give more time for Hardin.|
798|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Marth|Mmm, I was thinking the same. If we keep heading east, more needless blood will be spilt. So I have decided a different route for us to go. How about we go directly south from Menedi, and enter Millennium Court from Adria Pass?|
799|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Jagen|You want the troops to cross that dangerous mountain path? It's too dangerous...|
800|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Marth|I am already prepared for danger. Besides, we were able to conquer the dangerous Anri's Way, so this should be easy in comparison...|
801|FE3BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Jagen|...That's a fair point. If we can cross it, we can attack the enemy from the rear. Understood, we'll try that.|
802|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar2|Gharnef|Come, boy, you want to stop me again? This time I won't spare you!!|
803|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar2|Marth|Gharnef, give my sister and the others back!! Where have you taken them!?|
804|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar2|Gharnef|Hahahaha... Those clerics are going to become sacrifices for the resurrection of the Shadow Dragon. They are lost forever. Soon the Earth Dragon King, Medeus, will be reborn in his true form, and we require the clerics as live sacrifices. However their souls shattered because they couldn't stand the pain. Not even I can help them now. Thanks to them, the Shadow Dragon will awaken. He no longer fears even the power of the Binding Shield. It's a shame that everything's already over. Marth... You will die here!!!|
805|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar2|Gharnef|Hahahaha... Let me show you the might of my Imhullu spell...|
806|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar2|Gharnef|Haha... It's already too late... This world is done for... Urgh.|
807|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar2|Jagen|Your highness, there's a stairway leading up!!|
808|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Marth|...! Isn't that my sister and the others!? Who are they protecting...? Damn... That's... Is that Medeus...?|
809|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Jagen|Wait, if the princesses are in the way, your highness' sword will be unable to strike. We must think of something fast, otherwise the Earth Dragons will awaken, and then they will be in even more pain.|
810|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Marth|What should I do...? How can I save them? Please tell me Jagen.|
811|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Jagen|That... Not even I know. To defeat Medeus there is probably no other way except to...|
812|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Marth|...! What, you want me to kill them!?|
813|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Jagen|That is one way. The princess cannot suffer any more. Taking their life is also a way of saving them.|
814|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Marth|Jagen, are you SERIOUSLY telling me to make this decision?|
815|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Jagen|As leader, there are times when you must make painful decisions. That is what I meant.|
816|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Marth|Jagen, that's enough, I understand. I will not give up. There must be some other way. Until the very end, I will not give up!!|
817|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Cleric|THOSE WHO OPPOSE... LORD MEDEUS... MUST DIE...|
818|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Minerva|Maria! Please open your eyes. It's me, Minerva! Be strong!|
819|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Maria|Uh... Oh... Minerva, sister... Ahh, Medeus, he...|
820|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Minerva|Everything's alright now, relax. I'm sorry, Maria, for letting you experience all this...|
821|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Maria|Sister... I'm scared... so scared. Oh! How is brother? He fought with Gharnef to rescue me.|
822|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Minerva|Michalis, he... He's alright, Maria, don't worry.|
823|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Maria|Really? Then, when we return home, will we be like one big family again? That's great, sister. Oh, I really want to see brother again.|
824|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Minerva|Maria...|
825|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Sirius|Princess Nyna! Open your eyes! Be strong...!|
826|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Nyna|Ah... I made a huge mistake. Because of my stupidity... I caused such grief for Hardin. And I made him... turn into that. Oh... I... What should I do?|
827|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Sirius|Empress... Prince Marth has already ended Hardin's suffering. Even until the end Hardin still loved you, and he apologized for his crimes. It's alright now. You don't need to suffer anymore. You just had a bad dream, that's all...|
828|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Nyna|..... You are.....?|
829|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Sirius|Princess Nyna! You mustn't give up. You shouldn't be a weak person!|
830|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Nyna|Ah...! You are... Camus...!? You are Camus!! Why... Why are you... Am I dreaming? You're still alive... Ah... It's true...|
831|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Sirius|.....! Empress... I think you're mistaken. I am Sirius, a soldier of the allied army. I don't know anybody called Camus...|
832|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Nyna|Sirius...!? ...How...? No! That's wrong!! You must be...|
833|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Sirius|Please calm down. You must be very tired. I must leave this place very soon. Well, Empress Nyna... You should return to Prince Marth's side...|
834|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Nyna|You... Where are you going?|
835|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Sirius|I must return to my country. I... I have somebody waiting there for me.|
836|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Nyna|Really, is that so? I understand... Sirius... thank you.|
837|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Sirius|..... Sorry...|
838|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Nyna|Huh...!?|
839|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Sirius|It's... nothing... Empress, you must go!|
840|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Merric|Elice! It's me, Merric! Please open your eyes. I studied magic so that I could protect you... Yet I still couldn't do that, or be by your side... Elice... I'm begging you... Please open your eyes!|
841|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Elice|Merric...? ...! Oh, Merric! Save me... Gharnef, he... is so frightening... Please save me!|
842|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Merric|Elice! Great, you've finally awakened. It's alright now, I'm here. Oh... But Marth... and the others are watching... This is embarrassing. Elice, no matter what happens I won't leave your side again... Okay?|
843|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Julian|Miss Lena, wake up! It's me, Julian. What should I do? I know I'm a man with no merits, but for you I will do anything. I don't have any other wishes, I just want to see you smile, Miss Lena. Smile, I'm begging you, Miss Lena...|
844|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Lena|Oh... Julian... You did come. I believed that you would definitely come. So that's how I could endure the horrors that I faced... Julian, I'm sorry. I always acted like a spoiled brat to you.|
845|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Julian|No... Just hearing Miss Lena's words is enough for me.|
846|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Lena|Julian, can you listen to a request of mine?|
847|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Julian|Huh? Oh, please ask, as long as I can do it...|
848|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Lena|From now on, just call me Lena. It seems so impersonal when you call me Miss Lena. Because we're going to return to Macedon, to live together.|
849|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Julian|Huh? ...Miss Lena... Oh... No... I meant Le... na... Do you really mean that...|
850|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Lena|Mmm... I believe the deities will forgive me. Because of my... love for you.|
851|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Maria|Ah, Minerva, sister...|
852|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Nyna|Ah, Camus...|
853|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Elice|Ah, Merric...|
854|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Lena|Ah, Julian...|
855|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Medeus|I... HAVE RESURRECTED... STUPID HUMANS... I WILL KILL YOU ALL...|
856|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Medeus|HAHAHA... IT'S NOT OVER YET. YOUR NAIVETY... WILL DESTROY YOU... THOSE SISTERS WILL BE SACRIFICED... THEY WILL BECOME MY BLOOD AND MY FLESH... AND GIVE ME POWER!|
857|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Medeus|GWA...! WHY... WHY HAVE I... BEEN DEFEATED... SO EASILY...... IS THIS... THE POWER... OF NAGA'S... BINDING SHIELD...? BUT... HUMANS. DON'T FORGET... AS LONG AS GREED LIVES ON IN YOUR HEARTS... YOU WILL LOSE THE SHIELD AND I WILL RISE FROM THE EARTH ONCE AGAIN... REMEMBER... TH...IS...|
858|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Gotoh|Marth, courageous prince of Altea. Because of your efforts, the Dark Earth Dragon, Medeus, has finally been completely destroyed. Medeus's servants, the Earth Dragons have also vanished into the darkness. As long as the Binding Shield exists, they won't awaken anymore. Marth, descendant of Anri, and the chosen Prince of Light. You have saved mankind, and you have saved our dragon tribe...|
859|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Tiki|Marth!! I don't have to go back to the Ice Dragons' Temple anymore. I'm so happy! I really like everybody. I definitely don't want to live all by myself at that lonely place again. It's really... like a dream. I'm so happy, so very happy. Marth, I really like you!!|
860|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Marisha|Really Tiki... For how long do you plan on hogging Marth!? Honestly Marth, if you dare to show even the slightest happiness, Caeda won't forgive you.|
861|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Caeda|Marisha, you're talking nonsense again. However Marth really does look happy...|
862|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Marisha|He can finally put to rest his heavy burden. Lord Marth has always been carrying such a heavy responsibility. It must have been hard on him. But Caeda has also had it hard. There are so many people around Marth that finding a chance to even talk to him is difficult. You must have been lonely.|
863|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Caeda|Mmm... It doesn't matter. As long as Marth is safe, I wouldn't wish for anything else. I once prayed to the deities, since Marth had such an important mission. I prayed that if they decided his life was to be taken, to take my life in his place... That was all I could do.|
864|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Marisha|..... Ah, Caeda truly can't be beaten. But you don't have to wait any longer. Because Lord Marth is about to return to your side. Look, Caeda, Marth is looking over there. Use your courage!|
865|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Caeda|Marth...|
866|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Marth|Caeda, it's finally over. I'm sorry for making you suffer.|
867|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Caeda|No, I couldn't help you one bit... I'm the one that should be sorry.|
868|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Marth|Don't be silly. It's only because I had Caeda that I was able to reach this day. Things will be more difficult from now onwards. The seven kingdoms of Archanea are going to be unified, and everybody is going to hand responsibility to me. But, such a task I cannot possibly do by myself. Caeda, I hope you can help me. I really need you.|
869|FE3BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar3|Caeda|I... When I left Talys island, I already swore an oath. No matter where you went, I would be by your side. No matter what happened I would have faith in you. So, no matter what hardships there are, I can endure them. Because Marth... I lov...|
870|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Cain|Sire, you're safe!|
871|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Kris|Sir Cain! You made it!|
872|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|I'm truly glad that you came back unharmed, Cain.|
873|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Cain|Yeah, somehow I managed to shake off the enemy and escape here. But the enemy is already approaching from the north.|
874|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|Don't worry. We will crush them.|
875|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Cain|No, not this time. Hardin is being protected by a mysterious power: we can't lay a finger on him. So even if we fight him now, we haven't a chance of winning. Please, head to the northwestern fortress. There's a boat across the river, which we can use to escape to the Khadein desert.|
876|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jagen|Sire, the free company to the south will probably make their move soon. Indeed, now's not the time to fight. For the time being, let's do as Cain suggests and make our escape. After that, we'll think of something...|
877|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|I see... I don't like it, but we haven't a choice... Everyone, hurry to the northwest fortress!|
878|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Villager|If ya ask me, archers'll always get along well with archers.|
879|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Bantu|Oh look, if it isn't Prince Marth. Long time no see, Lad. It seems so noisy out; I wonder what's happened?|
880|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|Ah, Bantu! Fancy meeting you in a place like this. How is Tiki?|
881|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Bantu|Oh, she is no longer by my side. Lord Gotoh took her to the Ice Dragon's Temple again.|
882|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|The Ice Dragon's temple? Where's that? I've never heard of such a place...|
883|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Bantu|It's in the icy lands, far north of here. But it's no place for humans. Besides the hero Anri, no man has been there yet.|
884|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|Anri?! Are you, perchance, referring to the "Realm of the Gods" from Anri's legends?|
885|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Bantu|I'm not at liberty to say anything more. If you want to know more, you should ask Lord Gotoh. Anyhow, I have a favor to ask of you. My precious firestone was stolen by thieves. If you can get it back for me, I'll show you how it works. Thank you, Prince Marth.|
886|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Hardin|Heh heh heh... Prince Marth, it's been far too long.|
887|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|Hardin... Why did you attack our country? What would compel you to do such an act? I... I can't believe this. Have you really changed this much?|
888|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Hardin|Prince, I am the ruler of this continent and the Emperor of Archanea. I will show no quarter to anyone who opposes me. That includes you, Prince... I must destroy this foul world... It is beyond salvation. Traitors, playtime is over. You will all die here. All soldiers, attack! Do not leave a single traitor standing!|
889|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Gordin|Master! Please, wait!|
890|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jeorge|Hm...? Gordin? Long time no see. You seem to have gotten a little sturdier, but has your bow arm improved any?|
891|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Gordin|Yes, at the moment, I... They call me Altea's master of bows. It's thanks to you, Master, that I've been able to progress this far.|
892|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jeorge|And? Did you come here because you wanted to challenge your old teacher?|
893|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Gordin|N-no! It's not like that... ...I might be asking the impossible, but I'd like you to fight alongside us again, sir.|
894|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jeorge|......|
895|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Gordin|Please! Master!!|
896|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jeorge|I pledged allegiance to Princess Nyna, but as for Hardin... I've had it with him. Taking other countries by force, executing "rebels" without reason. The Archanean army I see now is just a collection of hired thugs. There's not even a shred of chivalry left. To return the kingdom of Archanea to what it was once before... I must take it upon myself to turn my bow against my homeland. Gordin. Convey that to Prince Marth.|
897|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Gordin|Thank you, Master!!|
898|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Astram|You traitors! I'll show you the might of Mercurius!!|
899|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Astram|Midia... My love...|
900|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jeorge|You wouldn't have needed to die if you hadn't come so close, fools...|
901|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jeorge|What fools...|
902|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Hardin|Rebel soldiers... Come to die, have you? I'll show you the terror of Gradivus!|
903|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jagen|Please hurry, sire. The enemy is closing in on us.|
904|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|But everyone is still fighting. I can't just leave them behind.|
905|FE3BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jagen|Don't worry, everyone will escape safely and reunite with you at Khadein. Now sire, to the boat!|
906|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|This place... It's incredible... I feel as though I'm burning up just by standing here.|
907|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|This is Flame Barrel... The fire dragons' graveyard. It's where the fire dragons who've degenerated into savage beasts come to wait for their death.|
908|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|Degenerated, you say...? What do you mean by that?|
909|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|I'm not sure if you're aware, but the dragon tribe is dyin'. Those who don't confine their true, dragon form in a stone eventually lose all reason and become monsters.|
910|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|So that's why they become Manaketes? Xane, if you know something about the dragon tribe, please tell me.|
911|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|If you really wanna know... Tens of thousands of years ago, the dragon tribe settled down on this continent, and created a civilization. They possessed intellect and abilities far exceedin' those of humans. But suddenly, outta nowhere, their day of destruction came. At first, they couldn't bear children. Then they began to lose their minds, goin' berserk one after the next. The elders warned that the end of dragons as a species was approachin'. There was no longer any way to prevent it. However, there was one way they could survive: to discard their identities as dragons and live on as humans. The dragons fell into a panic. Those who believed the elders sealed their forms within stones and became humans. But those who couldn't throw away their pride as a dragon; those who adamantly refused to become human... They eventually lost their minds and became naught but beasts...|
912|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|Those fire dragons before us...|
913|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|Yeah, they're a livin' example. And it's not just them. There are many others. But they've all gone feral now. There's no way for them to go back... Worse still, they've been manipulated and degraded like cattle by the fire clans who rule over this valley. Well, princey. Whadya say we get out of here? The clansmen around here ain't friendly; if we hang around, we'll end up as bait for their dragon pets.|
914|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|Phew! And that be the end of the fire dragons' valley. How you doin', princey?|
915|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|I'm fine... I think. Xane, I believe you said that there were other feral dragon tribes.|
916|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|Yeah. In addition to this valley, there's the Wyvern's Dale, the Ice Dragon Shrine and the Dragon's Altar...|
917|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|The Dragon's Altar?|
918|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|It's a dragon graveyard in the mountains of Macedon. There, the earth dragons sleep. A long time ago... Thousands of years ago in fact... The mighty earth dragons lost their minds and attacked the humans. 'Course, the humans barely stood a chance. Most were annihilated, and the rest pushed into the desolate corners of the continent. And then... the divine dragon Naga, strongest of them all, waged a war for humanity. It was a fierce battle, but Naga emerged victorious in the end, and sealed the earth dragons below Dolhr, in a deep sleep. And so that the power of the seal would not wither, she created the "shield of the five orbs" and placed it in the Fane of Raman.|
919|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|I see... I understand now. In other words, our guardian deity Naga depicted in legend was the divine dragon that saved humanity. But then, what about the divine sword Falchion?|
920|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|Naga took pity on you humans, with no way of protecting yourselves, so she created it from one of her fangs. Then, together with the shield, she sealed it in the fane, and had the remainin' dragon houses watch over humanity. She put the newly born Tiki to sleep and thus ended her 5,000-year life. 'Cause of all this, Gotoh's tryin' his best to carry out Naga's order.|
921|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|Wait, Xane... Are you telling me...!?|
922|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|Yes: Gotoh is a divine dragon. What, you thought it was just me?|
923|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|Wa-wait, Xane. I still don’t understand. What exactly did you mean?|
924|FE3BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|Phew, my throat is really dry. I can’t stand the heat anymore. Marth, let’s hurry along.|
925|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Ogma|Yuliya, Jubelo. This place is notorious for the Macedonian Vikings. If we could, we'd stay the hell away, but the village where Lord Wendell resides is just past this area.|
926|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Jubelo|Mister Ogma... I'm scared... Can we go back...?|
927|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Yuliya|Jubelo! Get a hold of yourself! You're a man, are you not? Show some spine! You can use a Fire tome, can't you? So... fight with it!|
928|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Jubelo|But Master Wendell said that we mustn't fight... Besides, I don't like fighting.|
929|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Yuliya|Ugh, stop complaining! It's just you and me now. You have to stay strong, because I... sniff... I don't know what we're supposed to do...|
930|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Jubelo|Oh... I'm sorry, Yuliya... I'll do my best, so... please don't cry!|
931|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Ogma|Damn... This can't be good... We've been spotted. Kids, we've got no choice; we're going to have to cut through. Do not leave my side!|
932|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Boy|D'you know of a staff called Rescue? I hear you can bring faraway allies right next to you in a flash! It'd be so cool if it were true!|
933|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Girl|Oh, those "Star Shards" are so shiny and pretty. If you hold on to them, something good might happen to you.|
934|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Villager|These days, all them bandits and pirates've been doin' as they please. Geez. This wouldn't 'ave 'appened if it weren't for all them political tomfoolery.|
935|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Villager|Oh, you're... you're... the prince of Altea! How nice of you to drop by, sir!|
936|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|I heard Lord Wendell was living here.|
937|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Villager|Yes, that, er... was correct... Yesterday, a group of Archanean soldiers suddenly came and took the pontifex away. Although, Prince... He did leave his magic tome behind. I believe it's wind magic. Please, take it with you.|
938|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|Well, if it isn't Castor! What brings you to a place like this?|
939|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Castor|Ah, Prince Marth! Erm... Actually, I need money for medicine for me sick mother. But I couldn't find any work in Talys, so I moved here instead.|
940|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|I see... That's terrible... I do hope your mother gets better. Well, goodbye then...|
941|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Castor|......... Wait!! Me mother, she's really sick... I need money, sir...|
942|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|Hm? Oh right, here. It's only a little, but I hope it helps.|
943|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Castor|Uhm... Thank you, Prince Marth. You don't have to be so kind to a guy like me...|
944|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|Castor... That's a bit much... It's only natural to help someone in need.|
945|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Castor|No, Prince Marth! You've done so much for me. I want to help you. Please, let me fight alongside you. You have my life at your disposal!!|
946|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Ogma|And just who the hell are you? Are you in league with the pirates?|
947|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Sirius|I am Sirius, a mere traveler.|
948|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Ogma|Oh, I see. I'm a little bit worked up right now. Sorry about the mix-up.|
949|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Sirius|Those children...|
950|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Ogma|I'm taking care of them. Do you know them?|
951|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Sirius|No, I don't... But I do know that, as things stand, you won't escape with them. As I understand it, the Altean army should arrive here, provided you reach the southern village. Please, allow me to distract the bandits, while you make your escape to safety.|
952|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Ogma|I see. So Prince Marth is here, eh? Got it, thanks. I've got to ask though. Why help a group of complete strangers like us?|
953|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Sirius|I want to save the children. That is... all.|
954|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Ogma|I see... Sirius... You said your name was Sirius, right? Let's meet again after we both get out of here! There's someone I need to take care of... The guy in charge of Grust's occupation, Commander Lang. I want to avenge a man named Lorenz... You--join me...! If I've got you on my side, then I'll be that much stronger.|
955|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Sirius|Yes... That would be interesting. But first, you have to survive. Hurry and go!|
956|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Sirius|Touch me and I'll strike you down.|
957|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Sirius|How foolish of me...|
958|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Guile|I'm sorry! ...I wasn't thinking! Gahaha, just kidding! I'll be smashing your pretty head in!!|
959|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Guile|I won't... forget this!|
960|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Caeda|Marth!!|
961|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|Caeda? Did something happen? Why are you here?|
962|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Caeda|Marth... Altea... Altea was attacked by the imperial army. The Archanean League... Gra and Aurelis ambushed us. Our forces were annihilated and we lost the castle...|
963|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|Wh-what did you say?! This can't be happening! Altea is... Jagen, what's going on?|
964|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Jagen|This is terrible beyond words... That which I feared the most has come to pass. Emperor Hardin likely heard Lang's story, and had us branded traitors.|
965|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|I refuse to believe it. Hardin would never attack Altea! You're telling me that he believed Lang and truly thought that I wished to instigate a rebellion? Never!|
966|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Jagen|No, I agree with you, sire. This attack was too soon. It happened far too quickly. For an attack of this scale, a great number of preparations had to have been in place. It is likely... that the Grust campaign was a setup. As was the situation in Macedon. It's quite simple, really. They had you leave Altea, with your elite knights in tow, and then proceeded to attack our weakened defenses. Hardin had this planned right from the start.|
967|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|That's preposterous! Are you implying that Hardin--with no provocation whatsoever--decided to attack his fellow nation? Are you seriously suggesting this was all an elaborate trap? No! I won't accept it... Hardin... why?|
968|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Jagen|Sire... Princess Caeda, what of the others? Is Princess Elice safe?|
969|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Caeda|Elice, she... She gave herself up in order to let me escape with this message. Marth... I'm so sorry. She wanted me to warn you, no matter what... Sniff...|
970|FE3BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|Caeda... Don't cry. I understand. Just knowing you're safe makes me happy. I should be the one apologizing. I shouldn't have left... You needn't have to go through this. We will take back Altea. Even if we have to fight Hardin, we WILL reclaim our homeland!|
971|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Palla|Julian, good news! Catria finally brought the Altean army for us! We're going to join their ranks to help save Princess Minerva. Please take Lena and escape to safety, quickly!|
972|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Julian|No can do, Palla. Lena's disappeared... I'm not leaving by myself.|
973|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Palla|What? Lena as well... Princess Maria is missing too; why is it only clerics...?|
974|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Julian|Anyway, I'm staying in the village to see if I can't find any information. Sorry, Palla. Give my best to Prince Marth.|
975|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Villager|This is just between you and me, but I heard that armory is in league with the rebels. If you're going to enter you should be careful not to get jumped.|
976|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Villager|I wonder what's going to happen to Macedon? They say that Prince Michalis is dead, and Princess Maria is nowhere to be found... On top of that, they say that Princess Minerva has been captured and that her life is in peril. I just hope... that this country doesn't end up like Grust...|
977|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Villager|You know, a little while ago, a paladin came here; said he was on a journey. He was wearing a mask, but I'm sure that underneath, he was a good person. He was kind, yet wrapped in a veil of sorrow. I wonder if I'll ever see him again...|
978|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Villager|The pegasus knight trio must be lonely without Est. And I was such a fan of their "Triangle Attack!" too... Oh, Est... Come home already, will ya?|
979|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Villager|Have you noticed the large drawbridge behind this village? Normally it's separated by the river, but if you use this key here, you can cross the bridge. Just, once you cross the drawbridge, the enemies on the other side will come and attack you at once. If you want to advance safely, you might be better off taking the long detour that goes right around the mountain. Here, take the key. No matter which path you take, do take care of yourself, m'kay?|
980|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Julian|Hey, Prince, it's been a while, hasn't it? It's me, Julian!|
981|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|Julian? I'd heard that you'd gone to Macedon with Lena, but to think we'd cross paths here... How is Lena? Of course, she's with you, right?|
982|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Julian|Well, er, how should I say this... Lena suddenly up and vanished... I... I don't know what to do.|
983|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|Wait, Julian, tell me what happened, in detail.|
984|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Julian|Lena's been missing since last night. The villagers speak of some sort of strange priest prowling around lately. It seems that somehow, Lena was taken by this man.|
985|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|A priest...? Julian, as it turns out, Princess Maria has gone missing as well. I have a terrible feeling about this. Anyway, staying here won't solve anything. Come with us. I'm worried for Lena, too. We'll all help to look for her.|
986|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Julian|Prince Marth... Thank you. Nothing would please me more.|
987|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Julian|Hey! Cut it out. Why must you always insist on pointing your sword at us? I pity Lena for having to put up with your stupidity.|
988|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Matthis|Oh, it's you, Julian. Are you still trying to worm your way into Lena's good books? No way, I won't hand my cute lil' sister to a thieving rat like you.|
989|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Julian|You can relax... Lena and I would never work out. But even if it's just a little, I wanted to help her in any way I could.|
990|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Matthis|Ooh, you finally realized where you stand. Attaboy, Julian!|
991|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Julian|Er, that's not the kind of thing I want to be hearing from you... Well, whatever. If you're worried about Lena, then come with me.|
992|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Matthis|Oh, alright, thanks. You see, they forced me to join the rebel army, but you know I hate fighting. Alright, lil' brother. Let's join forces and look for our cute lil' Lena!|
993|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Matthis|Lena... Where are you? What I would give to hear your voice just once before I die...|
994|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Matthis|Lena... F-forgive... your foolish big brother...|
995|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Rucke|D-damn it... Why is the Altean army here...? You're all going down with me. Die!|
996|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Rucke|The Altean knights... As I expected...|
997|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Jagen|Sire, the rebels have fled the castle, but I regret to inform you that Princess Minerva was nowhere to be found.|
998|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|What could have happened? She was supposed to be held inside the castle...|
999|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Lang|Oh-hoh, I knew this task was unworthy. Excellent work, Prince Marth. We'll take care of Macedon from here. Now, let us discuss your next mission.|
1000|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|General Lang, what in the world do you want this time?|
1001|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Lang|Well, you see... My castle was attacked and the Grustian prince and princess were kidnapped. The perpatrator fled to Macedon, it seems. Prince Marth, you are to capture him and return the children to me!|
1002|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|You're asking me to send those children to their doom!|
1003|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Lang|You're in no position to defy me. Now, off to work you go, my prince.|
1004|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Kris|You...! Your rudeness towards my liege has gone too far...! Shut up! Prince Marth is not your minion!|
1005|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Lang|What did you say?! Know your place, Altean soldier! Marth, it seems that your countrymen are devoid of manners!|
1006|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|...I apologize on his/her behalf. But it is as Kris says: General Lang, I will no longer follow your orders from here.|
1007|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Kris|Sire...!|
1008|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Lang|What! Do you mean to defy my orders?! I see... I see. As I suspected, it was YOUR doing. The person who kidnapped Grust's prince and princess was the mercenary, Ogma. On your orders, no less!|
1009|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|I didn't know of this. But if I had the choice, I would have done exactly as you suggested. Back at Grust, even though they were meant to be our enemies, I should have helped those children.|
1010|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Lang|You! You clearly speak words of treason! Perhaps I should report this to the Emperor!|
1011|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|Do as you will. But you're not the only person who intends to visit the palace. I will speak to Emperor Hardin and Princess Nyna and inform them of your crimes. Forgive me, Jagen. But I cannot stand for this any longer.|
1012|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Jagen|I understand. You have endured well until now. Lang, my liege might forgive your frequent rudeness to him, but I will not. Come, draw your sword. Even though I, Jagen, am old and senile, I will not lose to the likes of you.|
1013|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Lang|Wh... what did you say?! Damn you... I'll remember this!! Once the Emperor gets wind of this, I'll crush your puny little Altea!|
1014|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|Jagen... you're a bag of surprises. To think you'd stand up against Lang like that.|
1015|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Jagen|Sire, are you underestimating me in my old age? Bwahaha... I'm not about to let youngsters like Kris hog all the glory just yet. Still, I'll admit it was somewhat foolish to contest with Lang, even if he did push my lord at every turn.|
1016|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Kris|Sire, Sir Jagen. What is our next plan of action?|
1017|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|According to Lang, Ogma is on his way to Macedon. He probably intends to visit the village where Lord Wendell resides.|
1018|FE3BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Jagen|Understood. But, I worry about Lang... I pray that nothing bad shall happen...|
1019|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Marth|I should have expected no less from Archanea. They have such a powerful army. We won't be able to get close so easily.|
1020|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Jagen|Hardin is gambling everything on this one battle, and he appears to have gathered the entire army of Archanea here. But, any knights with a conscience already joined the coup and have nearly all been executed. All that remains are just weak mercenaries, so you don't need to fear them. Right now, many people hearts have already swayed from Hardin, and the citizens welcome us as their liberation army. This should give us confidence like no other. Anyway, this is the last battle. Although it might take time, please take care while advancing.|
1021|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Marth|I understand. Let's go, Jagen. I am worried about Midia.|
1022|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Woman|Emperor Hardin was once a kind man, but he suddenly changed into such a frightening Emperor... Ah... If I say things like this, I will get killed as well.|
1023|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Young Man|Midia is the pride of Archanea. She was the daughter of th highest officer of Archanea, Duke Owen. This rebellion only came about because she could not stand and watch us suffer. No matter what, you must rescue her.|
1024|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Young Woman|We thought that Nyna and Hardin's marriage would finally bring peace to the world, yet this happened. Oh deities... What should we do...?|
1025|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Old Man|Midia is really pitiful. She only just retired as a knight to live together with Astram, and now she has been separated again. She's still a young girl, it's so sad. What can you do to help her...?|
1026|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Man|The Archanea army has changed. The troops are all bloodthirsty savages now. What is going on with this country?|
1027|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Old Man|Oh, this is so sad. Those that opposed Emperor Hardin have all been killed... Could the Emperor be possessed by a demon...?|
1028|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Roshea|Prince Marth, I am Roshea of the Aruelis Knights. I have King Aurelis's permission to come here, and am awaiting your highness' orders. I am truly sorry for the battle at the pass. To apologize to you, I will join and fight alongside your army. Marth, please watch over me!|
1029|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Nehring|What...? Our Archanea has been defeated? But as long as I'm here, I won't let you enter the castle!|
1030|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Nehring|Glory to the Emperor...|
1031|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Boah|Oh, Lord Marth. I've been waiting for you.|
1032|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Marth|Boah!? You've suffered a grave wound... What happened?|
1033|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Boah|Mmm... It was truly frightening... I suppose the Archanea royal family is indeed under a curse. You should know about Hardin and Nyna's marriage, two years ago. To restore Archanea, a king was required, and only two people were suitable. King Aurelis's younger brother, Hardin, and Altea's Prince Marth, you... Those were the choices, and we pleaded for Nyna to make the final decision. Originally, she wanted to wait a while longer, but we begged for her to make up her mind immediately. In the end she said that choosing Prince Marth as her husband would hurt Princess Caeda, so she finally decided on Hardin.|
1034|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Marth|Wait a second, wasn't that a little harsh on Nyna? I understand that Archanea needed a king, but Nyna, she already...|
1035|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Boah|You are referring to Grust's Lord Camus? But that would be unspeakable... Unthinkable in fact. Princess Nyna was the sole successor of the royal bloodline of Archanea. I felt bad as well, but for this country we had no other choice. However, Lord Hardin was very happy. Compared to ascending Archanea's throne, he seemed happier about the fact that Nyna chose him for her husband.|
1036|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Marth|I also understand Hardin's feelings. He could sacrifice his own life for Nyna. But, did he know about Camus? If he did, I don't believe he would be so happy.|
1037|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Boah|Mmm... Of course we kept that a secret, and we also persuaded Nyna to hide it as best as she could. But, Lord Hardin was a very sensitive man. He quickly found out that Nyna's heart had no place for him. He felt very painful... He locked himself in his room, and didn't allow anybody to see him. Taking advantage of his broken heart, Gharnef appeared. He took on the guise of a merchant to approach Hardin, and showed him the Darksphere. The distraught Hardin was quickly consumed by the orb. From that day on, he completely changed. It was because I was only focused on restoring this country that I committed such a horrendous mistake. Please, forgive me, Prince Marth...|
1038|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Marth|I can't believe all that happened. ..... Where is Nyna now?|
1039|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Boah|When Hardin discovered that she had taken the Fire Emblem, he had her confined in her room. After that, she would still communicate in secret with me. However, Hardin found out and then wounded me. He also handed Nyna over to Gharnef.|
1040|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Marth|Gharnef...!?|
1041|FE3BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Boah|Mmm... Gharnef had always wanted to take Nyna. He said that the resurrection of the dark dragon required the blood of noble clerics... And so... He took Nyna... To use her as a live sacrifice... Lord Marth, I'm already done for. I will give my Thoron and Physic to you. I beg of you, please rescue Nyna. Even if Archanea is destroyed it no longer matters... I only wish for Nyna to be safe...|
1042|FE3BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|Jagen, where in the world are we...?|
1043|FE3BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Jagen|This is the path depicted in the Anri Saga. The first obstacle in Anri's Way: the Desert of Death. With its scorching sun, raging sandstorm, savage clansmen of the sands and wyverns that soar and dominate the skies. As the city of illusion shimmers in the distance, we can only stand and gaze... Or so the legend has it.|
1044|FE3BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|So Anri came through here as well. And by himself, too...|
1045|FE3BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Jagen|That’s right. King Anri began his travels here, to obtain the divine sword, Falchion. And that was so that he could rescue Princess Artemis… Although it will be long, I would like to describe the legend of Anri. 100 years ago… The ruler of this continent, the Holy Kingdom of Archanea, was destroyed by the dragon tribe.Humans were enslaved and lived each day in despair. Some people wielded weapons to fight back, but they couldn’t defeat the dragon tribe, and many people died. Also, the humans’ only hope, the Archanean royal family, was wiped out, and so the world lost all hope. However, at that time, at a small city called Altea. It was discovered that the princess of Archanea was hiding there. The angered Dolhr Empire sent soldiers to Altea, aiming to capture the princess. That princess… Artemis was prepared to give up her own life to save the citizens. However the citizens of Altea swore that, even if they were completely annihilated, they would protect the princess. Knowing that the princess was still alive, the citizens of Pales gathered a liberation army, and continued the fight against the Dolhr Empire. The leader of the liberation army, Duke Cartas, fought with the royal shield, given to him by Artemis. As a result, he received enormous support. Thanks to his efforts, the war finally began to become in their favour. But then, the king of the Earth Dragons, Medeus, finally moved out. The dark breath of Earth Dragons possessed horrendous destructive power and had the effect of halving the enemy’s strength. Under such a dire situation it was thought that Altea’s resistance wasn’t going to hold out. Then, at that time, a Sage appeared and told the people that at the Ice Dragons’ Temple, to the distant north, was a sword blessed by the deities. With that sword, the Earth Dragons could be defeated, but it definitely wasn’t an easy task to reach the temple…|
1046|FE3BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|So Anri, to save his beloved Artemis, left on a journey to obtain the sword?|
1047|FE3BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Jagen|Yes, that’s right. But I think that’s enough for today. We still have a long road ahead of us…|
1048|FE3BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Tiki|Mar-Mar!! It's been aaages. It's me, Tiki! I've wanted to see you for so long.|
1049|FE3BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|Huh... Tiki?! You came to welcome us? Oh, I see... you've been living with Lord Gotoh, haven't you? But you've certainly grown since last time. I'm glad to see you're well.|
1050|FE3BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Tiki|Yeah... But I was so lonely. 'Cause you never came to see me...|
1051|FE3BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|I'm sorry. But I could never forget about you. I had intended to invite you back to Altea once things had calmed down.|
1052|FE3BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Tiki|Mar-Mar... I... I love you!|
1053|FE3BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|What......?!|
1054|FE3BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Xane|...Gotcha!|
1055|FE3BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|Xa... Xane!!!|
1056|FE3BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Xane|I’m really sorry. I couldn’t help it after seeing that serious expression on your face… Sorry, don’t be angry. I was ordered, by Gato, to wait here for you. While I was waiting I got more and more angry, wondering why I had to do something so boring. So I thought I’d think of a prank to pull on you. But, my Tiki impression was pretty good wasn’t it? Huh, what’s with the anxious face? Well, shall we get goin'? You wanted to see Lord Gotoh, right?|
1057|FE3BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|Xane, how do you know Lord Gotoh? Just who are you?|
1058|FE3BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Xane|Well, lemme see. I don't think that really matters right now. Hey, put that jaw back in place and follow me.|
1059|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Phina|Huff... huff... Please... help me... The thieves... They're going to...|
1060|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Navarre|...|
1061|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Phina|No, it can't be! You're... one of them... as well? Oh, fine... Do your worst! If you're going to kill me, do it fast!!|
1062|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Navarre|Girl... Get behind me. The Altean army is marching towards the south of this forest. I'll take you to them.|
1063|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Phina|Huh? You're going to help me? You mean, you're not with the thieves?|
1064|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Navarre|Until just now, I was. But, I've changed my mind.|
1065|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Phina|Why...?|
1066|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Navarre|There's someone in the Altean army that I want to see. That's all.|
1067|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Phina|Hmmm... But really, it's 'cause I'm cute, right? At any rate, I'm glad. My name's Phina. I'm a dancer from Warren. People say that once they see my dancing, they feel instantly refreshed! I can show you, if you like. Oh, I should tell you my story: I got separated from my troupe, and wandered into this forest. And then, those horrible thieves came and tried to take me by force... But it's okay now. You seem kind of scary, but actually you're very kind. However, your appearance is... Your face isn't bad, but your dress sense is kind of lacking. And, ugh, what's with your hair? You know, nowadays...|
1068|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Navarre|Just stop talking! Anyway, don't stray too far. We'll cut our way to the west corner, and then escape through there. If you want to live, then shut up and come with me.|
1069|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Phina|Ah... Y-yes, sorry...|
1070|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Villager|The ancient Fane of Raman is just a treasure trove to thieves. You can see 'em carrying the stolen treasure all over the place. I hope they get cursed or something...|
1071|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Villager|The ones protecting the bridge are Astram's free company: powerful men who stop at nothing. As a wise man once said: "Let sleeping dogs lie", eh?|
1072|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Villager|I wonder if you've seen that young lady's dance? Marvelous, isn't it? Makes a tired body feel healthy again in the blink of an eye!|
1073|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Villager|You must never go near that cave. I heard a rumor that in that cave dwells a terrible fire dragon.|
1074|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Astram|Traitors! I'll show you the might of the Mercurius!|
1075|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Astram|Midia... My love...|
1076|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Dahl|Tryin' to take a cut from a thief's plunderin'... You people ain't even human!|
1077|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Dahl|Murderers... the lot of you...|
1078|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|Sire, we've driven away the thieves, but the temple was completely ransacked; anything that wasn't nailed down is gone.|
1079|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Marth|Really, even Raman Temple has been reduced to ruins? This is a frightful age we’re in.|
1080|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|Yes, I'm sure even Guardian Deity Naga would be furious. 'Tis truly the end of civilzation.|
1081|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Marth|Jagen, do you know the legend of Naga?|
1082|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|Yes; only vaguely, however. It's said that a thousand years ago... when there was not one king in the lands, people lived in small villages. One day, terrible monsters descended and the humans were massacred, pushed to the brink of extinction. The few who survived prayed to the gods for salvation. The gods heard their prayers, and a gigantic warrior was sent down to earth. The warrior carried a gleaming blade of light in his right hand, and in his left hand, a shield embedded with five orbs. Then, after a fierce battle, he eradicated the monsters and returned to the heavens. He was our guardian deity, Naga, and this temple is dedicated to him. "He was the avatar of the gods: our guardian deity..." Your highness, you should know that line from the first chapter of the Raman Bible.|
1083|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Marth|With the blade of light and the five orbs... That is the legend of Naga...|
1084|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|Well then, sire. We have to cross the Chiasmir Bridge soon. We must hurry; if the enemy takes it, getting across will be nigh impossible.|
1085|FE3BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Marth|Alright then, inform the whole army: We cross Chiasmir Bridge at once. Make sure no one falls behind!|
1086|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Jagen|Your highness, we've entered the castle! But don't forget that Hardin is being protected by the Darksphere. To fight him , you must have the Lightsphere!! Be sure to let the person fighting him carry it.|
1087|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|Midia, even you betrayed me. Archanea's paladins have lost their touch.|
1088|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Midia|You fool!! Don't you see it? What you're doing isn't normal. Where did you take Nyna to? Bring her back to us now!!|
1089|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|Nyna! That woman betrayed me. I just wanted to destroy Grust. And she had to go and give the Emblem to that boy... Those who betray me must die. Midia, you're no exception!!|
1090|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Midia|If you want to take my life, go ahead. But Hardin... Do you know how much suffering you've caused because of your stupid jealousy? Just open your eyes and see!|
1091|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|Stupid jealousy...? Haha... You can say what you like. This world is corrupt and full of annoying people. Is this kind of world even worth anything? It would be far better for it to be destroyed. Midia, you shall watch here... As Prince Marth dies by hand!!|
1092|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|Marth...? As a servant of the Empire, you dared to invade Millennium Court. I am disappointed in you. So Altea's Prince of Light is just a lowlife.|
1093|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Hardin! Your are being controlled by the Darksphere, and have lost your just heart!! Please, you must return to normal!|
1094|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|Hahaha...! You are so naive, Marth. I attacked Altea solely because of my hatred of you. In the previous war, it was only because you were the descendant of Anri that Nyna gave the Emblem to you, and chose you to become the leader of the alliance. Prince of Light... What nonsense! If you hadn't received my support you would have died long ago, so don't act all big, Marth!! From that day on, I hated you. I kept silent for Nyna, but I knew I would have to deal with you eventually. This has nothing to do with the orb!|
1095|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Hardin... Is that true... Your hatred of me... I didn't know...|
1096|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|Ha... That's why you're just a boy. Marth! Come to me, so I can use my Gradivus to pierce your heart!! In this tiny continent, I am the only hero that is needed!|
1097|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|Rebels... Did you come here to get yourselves killed? I'll show you to fear my Gradivus!!|
1098|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|Marth... Your highness... I have finally awakened... From my deep dream... Your highness... I am deeply sorry... I fought with my inner demon. However I was too weak... I resisted with all my might... But I still lost... I hoped for your highness' hand to end my life... That way I could be saved... Your highness... Nyna... Please take care of Nyna... She... I hope you... can tell her... In the... end... I still... loved her... I hope... She can... forgive me...|
1099|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Jagen|Marth, it's finally over. Now, the world is safe. Look, the princesses are over there...|
1100|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Sister! And there's Princess Nyna... And Lena and Maria was well.|
1101|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Nyna|Marth, you finally came. I am so happy...|
1102|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Nyna|Gwaa!! Damn, you're carrying the Binding Shield... Urgh... My illusion has been shattered! Come, Dark Priests. It has come to this... We must resurrect the Shadow Dragon immediately!|
1103|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Jagen|Huh, wasn't that Gharnef? He and his men pretended to be the princesses.|
1104|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Mmm, but what are they planning? They said something about resurrecting the Shadow Dragon... So my sister was indeed taken by Gharnef...|
1105|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Jagen|Your highness, I apologize for interrupting you, but Gotoh has come.|
1106|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Huh, Gotoh!? Please call him here!!|
1107|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Gotoh|Marth, you have done well. You have all five orbs in your possession. Because of your efforts the lost Binding Shield has finally been restored.|
1108|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Yes! The five orbs have attached onto the royal shield... So this is the Binding Shield? But, Gotoh, what should I do next? After seeing Gharnef's expression, it seems he really has taken my sister and the others. I can't just leave them.|
1109|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Gotoh|Mmm... I understand your feelings... But you must first restore the seal on the Earth Dragons. Those beasts will soon awaken from their slumber. When they appear from the ground they will burn everything, and create Hell on Earth. Go, Marth. Send the awakened Earth Dragons back into the darkness of the seal!!|
1110|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Jagen|Marth, it's finally over. Now, the world is safe. Look, the princesses are over there...|
1111|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Sister! And there's Princess Nyna... And Lena and Maria as well. It's great to see that everybody is safe.|
1112|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Nyna|Marth, you finally came. I am so happy... I will need your help to restore Archanea.|
1113|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Elice|You really worked hard, Marth. You are my pride.|
1114|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Lena|Lord Marth, with our combined strength we have already vanquished Gharnef. Please relax.|
1115|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Maria|The world is safe now. Your highness, please hurry back to Altea.|
1116|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Really? It's good to see everybody well. But you all don't look too good...|
1117|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Nyna|Everybody is tired from battling Gharnef. But it doesn't matter now, so please don't worry.|
1118|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Really...? Nyna, I am sorry about Hardin. I couldn't save him.|
1119|FE3BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Nyna|It's fine. He was devoured by his own ambitions, so it is not unexpected that he was lost. Well, Marth, you should hurry back to your homeland. Everybody is probably worried about you. With your remaining time, you must live well. As long as there are still people in this world, your name will never be forgotten.|
1120|FE3BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|Xane, we've already climbed this high. It's so cold... Even breathing is hard.|
1121|FE3BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Xane|We're almost there. Look, can you see over there? That's the Ice Dragons' Temple where Gotoh is.|
1122|FE3BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|But, that was quite a shock. Tiki is actually the daughter of the Divine Dragon King. Also, both Gotoh and you are Divine Dragons.|
1123|FE3BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Xane|Ah... When the Divine Dragons fought the Earth Dragons they over-exhausted their dragonstones, and so practically became extinct. Aside from Naga, only Gotoh, me and the just born Tiki survived. However, after the war we discarded our dragonstones, so we could no longer become dragons again. Even so, I still have knowledge and power that exceeds that of humans. Gotoh followed Naga's orders to protect humans, but that's got nothing to do with me. I don't like humans. They scorned the Manaketes, even though they had lost their power, and treated them like filth. I can fully understand why Medeus and the others hated humans so much. The Earth Dragon King, Medeus, tricked his own tribe and became a Manakete by himself. He used to follow Naga's orders and guarded the Dragons' Altar. However the once docile humans finally achieved power and became aggressive. They even started to attack the Manaketes that lived in peace. The Manaketes were angered by the betrayal of humans, and gathered at the Dolhr region. They formed their own kingdom of Manaketes and began a war to conquer the humans. To save the humans, Gotoh handed the Falchion to Anri and he created an academy of magic at Khadein. But whoever won wasn't any of my concern.|
1124|FE3BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|Then, why are you helping me? I'm also a human...|
1125|FE3BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Xane|You're different from the others. You don't seem like an unreliable person either...|
1126|FE3BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|Mmm... Thank you, Xane.|
1127|FE3BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Xane|Don't... don't be silly. I'll get embarrassed. Anyway, let's head to the temple, but be careful of the Ice Dragons. Although they're also wild dragons, they will instinctively try to protect their temple. Poor guys...|
1128|FE3BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|Hey, Xane. Gotoh didn't really mention anyting about the five orbs, but I thought they were very important. Do you know anything about them?|
1129|FE3BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Xane|Gotoh was afraid of shocking you so he didn't say anything. I will tell you. However, after I've told you, you'll probably think it was better off not knowing. The orbs rest on the shield that seals the Earth Dragons... Basically they are part of the Shield of Seals. Since ancient times, the Divine Dragons have passed down these sacred jewels, each possessing different powers. To put it simply, the shield is just a pedastal and the five orbs are what creates the power of the seal. So if any one of the orbs is lost the seal will weaken.|
1130|FE3BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|Hmm, is that so? But, how come the orbs were scattered?|
1131|FE3BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Xane|Because the shield was broken. The Shield of Seals was displayed at the Fane of Raman, and it was stolen by somebody who ended up breaking it...|
1132|FE3BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|When did that happen?|
1133|FE3BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Xane|Around 600 years ago. To recover the shield, Gotoh spend many years searching the lands. In the end, he only found the five orbs, with the shield nowhere to be seen. Not only that, but the five orbs, which he painfully collected, were scattered again after Raman was attacked in the previous war.|
1134|FE3BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|Really? ...So that was why Gotoh was looking for the lost jewels... the orbs?|
1135|FE3BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Xane|Yep, the Starsphere, Lightsphere and Geosphere... as well as the Darksphere and Lifesphere. The Lightsphere is in Gotoh's possession, that Starsphere was shattered and the Darksphere was given to Hardin by Gharnef.|
1136|FE3BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|The Geosphere is in Altea and all that remains is the Lifesphere.|
1137|FE3BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Xane|Ah... Anyway, let's enter the temple. From now on I will also help you fight. Well, let's go!|
1138|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|Merric. It's time to put an end to this.|
1139|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Merric|Wait, Arlen! Why do we have to fight? We were both Master Wendell's pupils: we're friends, are we not? Why do you despise me so?|
1140|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|I was Master Wendell's disciple before you, and I was the stronger one. Even so, Master Wendell gave you Excalibur. He should have given it to me! Clearly, I was the only one worthy to be his successor, yet he...|
1141|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Merric|But I have no intention of succeeding Master Wendell. I hold no ill feelings for Khadein, but once I finish studying I plan to go home. Back in Altea, there is somebody I must protect for the rest of my life... So, Arlen, please! Why don't you join us so we can take back Altea?|
1142|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|Altea, you say?! Why should we help a country that rebelled against the empire and attempted to invade their fair nation? The mage corps of Khadein have sworn allegiance to Emperor Hardin. Oh, I see... I knew it was you... YOU dragged the Altean army here!|
1143|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Merric|No!! That's not how it is!|
1144|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|Shut your mouth, traitor!! I won't listen to your lies any longer! Your Excalibur and my Thoron; we'll put them to the test!|
1145|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Wendell|Arlen! What are you doing?!|
1146|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|Master Wendell...|
1147|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Wendell|You still don't understand my decision, do you? Indeed, as a mage, your power surpasses mine. But you lack compassion. That is why I did not grant you Excalibur.|
1148|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|... Compassion...?|
1149|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Wendell|I had decided that you were to be my successor when the time came. To think you would harbor a grudge towards me... Does that not make you the same as Gharnef?|
1150|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|The same as Gharnef...? Teacher! What are you saying?|
1151|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Wendell|Arlen, listen to me... Gharnef, along with Pontifex Miloah, were Lord Gotoh's best pupils. But Lord Gotoh saw Gharnef's weakness, and so he left Khadein and the Aura tome to Pontifex Miloah. Gharnef, overcome by jealousy, stole the Darksphere from Lord Gotoh, and created the Imhullu tome. As a result... His heart was trapped within the Darksphere for all eternity. Wrath and envy led him to ruin. Do you understand now, Arlen...?|
1152|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|...Teacher... ...Teacher! I'm so sorry. I... I was wrong. Please... find it in your heart to forgive me!|
1153|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Wendell|Arlen, you will use that power of yours for the good of the people. Understand?|
1154|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Gotoh|Marth... Do you hear me?|
1155|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|Lord Gotoh! Yes, I can. You are speaking to me through magic, are you not? Lord Gotoh, I must ask: what has happened to cause Hardin to suddenly change so much?|
1156|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Gotoh|Hmm... The Darksphere is the culprit... Hardin's soul is trapped within the Darksphere...|
1157|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|The Darksphere? What on earth is that?|
1158|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Gotoh|Light, Star, Earth, Life and Darkness... In this world, there exist five sacred orbs. The Darksphere is that which complements the Lightsphere; in battle, it possesses the enemy's mind, negating their attacks. But the Darksphere also amplifies wrath and envy, and can turn their owner into a demon. Hardin must have obtained the Darksphere from somewhere... And now his heart has been lost to it.|
1159|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|But why? He should have been happy after his union with beloved Princess Nyna, so why the envy?|
1160|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Gotoh|Prince... Humans are never simple creatures... In any case, the only object that can overcome Hardin's Darksphere is the Lightsphere. If you want to do something about him, then you had best come and get it from me.|
1161|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|Huh? Really, Lord Gotoh? If we have the Lightsphere, then we can save Hardin?|
1162|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Gotoh|Well... If his heart is not completely consumed, then perhaps.|
1163|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|Lord Gotoh! Please, lend the Lightsphere to me.|
1164|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Gotoh|If you come in person to the Ice Dragon's Temple where I reside, then you shall have it. But that will be no easy task. So, Marth. Do you have the courage to walk the path that Anri walked?|
1165|FE3BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|Yes, I do! I will go!! Please, allow me to go! I must have the Lightsphere!|
1166|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Catria|Prince Marth!! Thank goodness you've come to Macedon!|
1167|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|Catria?! I received word that there was a rebellion in Macedon. Are you unharmed?|
1168|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Catria|Yes, I'm fine. My older sister Palla and I managed to escape somehow. But Princess Minerva was captured by the rebels. Prince Marth, please... You have to rescue Princess Minerva! At this rate, her life will be in danger!|
1169|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|Of course I will help her. Catria, please take us to where she is.|
1170|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Catria|Yes, my lord! But first we have to break through these woods. General Rumel's dragon knight squad is lurking within this area. If we approach from the front, we'll be easy pickings for them.|
1171|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|I see...So you're suggesting we flank them from the left or right. Thank you, Catria. Leave it to us!|
1172|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Villager|Warren's a bit of an idiot. Just 'cause they paid him well, he went ahead and joined the rebel army! Ahh, to think a fool like him was once acquainted with the fair Catria...|
1173|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Villager|Look out for those pilfering thieves. If they take off with your precious treasure, you won't ever get it back. Never let them escape from your sight.|
1174|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Villager|Because of the last war, every nation has been forced to lead hard lives. The only well-off country is Archanea, ruled by Emperor Hardin.|
1175|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Villager|Some dirty thieves took our village treasure, the Lady Sword, and ran off with it. Only women can wield the incredible power of that sword. Please, prise it back from their filthy hands.|
1176|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Villager|Beware when dracoknights are around. Even from a far-off distance, they can move all at once and swoop down on you!|
1177|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Catria|Warren?! Even a good man like you has sided with the rebel army...|
1178|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Warren|Catria the White, huh? It's been a while. You know I'm just a common hunter. If they pay me enough, I'll do anything.|
1179|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Catria|Warren, listen to me! Princess Minerva endeavored to create a country where its people could live at ease. She exiled soldiers and generals of ill repute to accomplish that goal. But General Rucke, despite knowing this, roused the soldiers into a coup d'etat. Can't you see? He's just trying to make this country into his own! And you can honestly say you're okay with that?|
1180|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Warren|...I see. Well, I don't like the military acting as if they owned the place... Alright then. If you're going to help the princess, then so will I.|
1181|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Warren|No hard feelings. I don't have anything against you, but this is the way I live. Forgive me!|
1182|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Warren|Damn it... I should've seen this coming...|
1183|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Rumel|Taste the terror of Macedon's fearless dracoknight squad!|
1184|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Rumel|General Rucke, I leave the rest to you...|
1185|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Jagen|Sire, we found someone most unusual confined in one of the fortress rooms.|
1186|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|Hm? ...Linde! How did you wind up in a dangerous place like this?|
1187|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Kris|Sire, do you know this woman?|
1188|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|Yes, this is Linde. Her natural talent for magic helped us a great deal in the last war.|
1189|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Linde|Prince Marth! Thank heavens. What a pleasant surprise meeting you here. I desperately needed to see you again, so I set out to find you. But the Macedonian soldiers found me suspicious and they dragged me to this fortress...|
1190|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|Is that so? I'm glad you're safe. But, why were you looking for me? Shouldn't you be by Princess Nyna's side?|
1191|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Linde|I was requested by Princess Nyna to deliver you this.|
1192|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|Huh? This...! This is the Fire Emblem! The royal heirlom of Archanea: the Emblem Shield!|
1193|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Kris|The Fire Emblem... I heard that in the last war, Princess Nyna entrusted you with it, sire...|
1194|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|Indeed. I looked after this as Archanea's representative in the last war. But why give this to me now? Especially at a time when Archanea has so much influence under Emperor Hardin's reign? In this peaceful age, why is Princess Nyna giving me the "Champion's Proof"...?|
1195|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Linde|I don't understand either. Princess Nyna didn't explain why, just that I had to give it to you... I remember her eyes seemed so sad... I think she may have been crying...|
1196|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|Princess Nyna crying?! What on earth has been happening...? Linde, after this battle ends, I will go see Princess Nyna. Until then, I want you to remain with us.|
1197|FE3BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Linde|Yes, Prince Marth!!|
1198|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Michalis|Minerva, if you wait in this village, you will most certainly run into Marth. I don't like him, but he is indeed noble. Join forces with him.|
1199|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Minerva|Brother, what are you going to do now? Won't you come with me...?|
1200|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Michalis|I have no intention of doing that. I only wish to find Maria and bring her home to Macedon.|
1201|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Minerva|You've changed, Brother... Or should I say, you've returned to how you used to be. As I thought, back then you were being controlled by Gharnef's dark magic.|
1202|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Michalis|No, no magic could bend my will. I wished to crush the arrogant Archanea, and establish Macedonian supremacy over this continent. But Father, without bending his ear to me, distanced himself from me and later had me banished.|
1203|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Minerva|Are you saying that's why you murdered Father? What a fool you were... Didn't you realize that was Gharnef's plotting all along? Yes, Father was strict with you. But it was only because he loved you. Why couldn't you see that?|
1204|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Michalis|Enough, Minerva. Do you take me for a fool? After I was defeated, I wandered the gap between life and death. When I had come to, in front of me, I was Maria--her eyes full of tears--praying to the gods. While I treated her like a pawn, Maria, she shed tears for me... Minerva, I'm going now. I have to save Maria. At least that can be my atonement!|
1205|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Minerva|Michalis...|
1206|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|Jagen, everybody appears to be safe. That’s great to see.|
1207|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Jagen|But, your highness, what should we do next?|
1208|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|Hmm... I want to go home to Altea, but if we can't prevail against Hardin, then we can't go back. What in the world are we supposed to do...?|
1209|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Jagen|Please wait a second. I just received some news.|
1210|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|…..|
1211|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Jagen|Sire, it's an emergency! I have just come into some new information. The Khadein mage corps has launched an offensive against us. It seems Khadein has allied with the Empire.|
1212|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|What!? Even Khadein means to be our enemy... Merric, what are you...|
1213|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Jagen|At this rate, it seems we have no choice. Sire, we need to break into the sanctuary, but you must be prepared to make sacrifices. If we don't hurry, Archanea's pursuit force will reach our rear and we'll be trapped.|
1214|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|I understand. We've no choice. Everyone, let's break into the sanctuary! But avoid needless fights if possible!|
1215|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Villager|A swordslayer will demonstrate your might against a mercenary or a hero. You should definitely get one if you can.|
1216|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Villager|From here on north, you won't see no more shops. If you're going that way, you should stock up now.|
1217|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Villager|The person commanding Khadein's mage corps is a young man named Arlen. He's not a bad man, but he can be a bit uncooperative. Seems he regards his old rival, Merric, with disdain. Hmm... I reckon only Lord Wendell could talk some sense into him.|
1218|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|Huh? Princess Minerva, why are you here?|
1219|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Minerva|My brother... Michalis, he helped me.|
1220|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|Really? That's good to hear. I was so worried once I heard that Prince Michalis had taken you. But, for him to rescue you: what in the world happened?|
1221|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Minerva|Maria saved Michalis's life. She's kind, unlike myself... Maria's kindness was able to touch the heart of even a man like Michalis.|
1222|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|But, isn't that what you wanted? That's why you deliberately avoided killing Michalis. Am I wrong, Princess?|
1223|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Minerva|Hmm......|
1224|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|I can understand. No one can sever the ties between family so easily. Princess, please lift your spirits. I would like you to fight with us again, just like before. I would like Macedon's strength and yours in order to put a stop to Hardin's designs.|
1225|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Yodel|I will not forgive intruders upon our holy sanctuary! Earth, show your fury! Bolganone!!|
1226|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Yodel|Arlen... Was this really what you wanted...?|
1227|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Jagen|The atmosphere inside the building seems somewhat strange.|
1228|FE3BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|Indeed, something seems to be happening. Let's go, Jagen. I'm worried about Merric!|
1229|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Toras|Commander Lang. The... A-Altean army has arrived...|
1230|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Lang|You moron. Why are you so panicked? With their nation and name in ruins, the Alteans are of no consequence to us.|
1231|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Toras|But, Sir Jeorge's archers left to quell the rebellion. Can we win with just our troops?|
1232|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Lang|Why didn't you tell me earlier? Call Jeorge back to the castle this instant! While you're there, find that hired sword, Navarre, and bring him here. General Toras! I'm heading inside. You will defend this location till your last breath. Do NOT let the enemy get close. Do I make myself clear?!|
1233|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Soldier|Captain Jeorge. We've received orders to return to the castle immediately.|
1234|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Jeorge|Orders from Lang, huh? I'm not fond of that man. His treatment of our people is simply intolerable. To work beneath him is an insult. Pay his orders no mind.|
1235|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Soldier|But, Captain! You'll be accused of treason! Captain?! You can't be planning to defect to Altea...|
1236|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Jeorge|No, that's not an option. If I were to defect now, I'd drag the entire platoon down with me. So for that reason alone, I will absolutely not take any risks that might besmirch our name.|
1237|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Soldier|Captain Jeorge...|
1238|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Jeorge|Anyway, inform everyone: Do not move from your stations. However, if the enemy approaches, you may engage them.|
1239|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Villager|Y'know, lately I haven't seen that mercenary, Samuel. I thought that he might have joined your ranks, but I guess not... He's as lax as they get, but you can't go wrong with his skill.|
1240|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Villager|Oh, Alteans, hear our plea! Please, defeat General Lang! As long as that man lives, peace is but a fleeting dream.|
1241|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Elder|Ohh, if isn't Prince Marth! I wonder how my granddaughter Lena is faring, hm? What, you don't know? I see... Th-then... Do you still want this Hammerne staff? At least, if Lena's pupil Marisha were around, I'm sure she could use it... Well, whatever be the case, I've no use for a souvenir. Please, make good use of it.|
1242|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Julian|Hey, Rickard! I see you haven't tired of stealin'.|
1243|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Rickard|Ah! Chief! How nice to see ya. Well, I was plannin' on workin' with you and makin' loadsa money, but you had to go and quit the business! Fallin' head over heels for that beautiful cleric, and then dumpin' me... That's just too cruel! Did our love really mean that little to you?|
1244|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Julian|Can it, you little fink!! People'll get the wrong idea about us, if you keep talkin' like that. Anyway, forget about thievin' and come with me to fight for justice.|
1245|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Rickard|Hmm... alright then! I'll follow you anywhere. I do adore ya, Chief!|
1246|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Jeorge|You wouldn't have needed to die if you hadn't come so close...|
1247|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Jeorge|Fools...|
1248|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Rickard|Chief, where aaare ya?|
1249|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Rickard|Tch. Man, I messed up big time.|
1250|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Toras|Projection 44.5 degrees! Fiiiire!!!|
1251|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Toras|General Lang... Altea is too strong...|
1252|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Jagen|Sire, we've finally seized control of Grust. However, a number of enemies are concealed within the castle. Our job here is far from over.|
1253|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Marth|Yes, I know. Lang must be stopped here and now. Or else we forsake the people of Grust.|
1254|FE3BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Jagen|That’s right. He must be defeated at all costs… But we don’t know what dastardly plans he has prepared for us. We must take extra caution when fighting inside the castle!|
1255|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|This is the Ice Dragons' Temple. Anri's final destination...|
1256|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Jagen|Yes. It was here that Anri obtained the Falchion, which he used to defeat Medeus with. Then, encouraged by the citizens of Altea, he became their first king.|
1257|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|But, in the end he wasn't able to be with Artemis... Why? Weren't they loving together?|
1258|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Jagen|The nobles of Archanea didn't want Anri, a former peasant, to become their own king. Instead they encouraged the princess to marry the leader of the liberation army, Duke Caldas. Princess Artemis was unable to refuse. "The bearer of the Fire Emblem, must give their life to the royal family". That is a saying passed down unflinchingly by the Archanea royal family. The Princess didn't tell Anri anything and accepted Caldas's engagement.|
1259|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|How could she...? That was unfair to Anri.|
1260|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Jagen|What was worse was that the princess died immediately after giving birth to her newborn prince. Also King Anri never married in his life. The Kingdom of Altea was succeeded by his younger brother, King Marcelus... That is to say, your highness's great grandfather.|
1261|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Such a tragic tale... So that was Artemis's fate? All because of the curse of the Fire Emblem...?|
1262|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Marth, you must stand in front of this wall! Only then will the door open.|
1263|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Prince Marth, you finally came! I should have expected nothing less from the one who possesses the heroic bloodline of Anri. To reward your courage, I will hand the Lightsphere to you. With this, the Darksphere will lose its power and it will no longer be impossible to fight Hardin. Also, about the Starsphere shards...|
1264|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|What!? You found all the shards? Thank you, then the Starsphere can be restored. Please wait a moment...|
1265|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|||
1266|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Marth, this is the Starsphere. You can take this with you as well.|
1267|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Huh? Gotoh, why are you giving such an important item to me?|
1268|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|The only person that can restore the Shield of Seals is you... The Shield, itself, has chosen you.|
1269|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|.....?|
1270|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|You still don't understand? The Emblem shield you're carrying is the stolen Shield of Seals. To be honest, it was only recently that I noticed; its exterior had completely changed... After stealing it from the Fane of Raman, the thief removed its jewels and sold them off as treasures. The money was used to fund an army, which, along with three stolen weapons, was used to conquer the world. The thief that went on to become the king of Archanea had the shield, which brought him such good fortune, it became the emblem of his royal family. Now do you understand, Marth? It is what you are carrying, Archanea's Fire Emblem.|
1271|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|!! What... ...The first king of Archanea was originally a thief!? Is that true...? In that case, I can kind of understand the curse of the Fire Emblem... Then, Gotoh... If I can collect all five orbs, can I restore the Shield of Seals?|
1272|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Mmm... But please hurry up. The shield has already been broken for 600 years... It is almost time for the Earth Dragons, sealed underneath Macedon, to awaken from their slumber. Those evil Earth Dragons number several hundreds... No, several thousands. Once they awaken there will be nothing that we can do... I will leave Tiki in your care. You can find her in the room to the right. That Divine Dragon child should be able to help you battle the Earth Dragons. But, I will state clearly, if the Shield of Seals is not restored, Tiki will be destroyed.|
1273|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Huh...!? Why is that...|
1274|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|That child is still developing. Without the Shield of Seals she will begin to degenerate. Eventually she will become wild and attack humans. I made her sleep, because I felt sad for her. But, if the Shield of Seals is restored I will no longer have to worry, because the shield will protect Tiki. Marth, please take care of Tiki. You must rescue that child from the path of ruin.|
1275|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Is that so. You couldn’t find them all... There’s nothing you can do about it... Please hand your collected shards to me. Tiki is sleeping in the room to the right. But since the shield isn’t restored, I can’t let you see her. That child is still developing. Without the Shield of Seals she will begin to degenerate. Eventually she will become wild and attack humans. I cannot allow Tiki to awaken again. It is for her own good... Marth, once you’ve obtained all the treasures, head to the room to the left. I will be waiting for you...|
1276|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Tiki!? Are you alright...|
1277|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Tiki|Uh...|
1278|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Tiki, it's me, Marth. Hey, open your eyes!|
1279|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Tiki|...Marth... .....! Oh Marth!! You came! You came to see Tiki!!|
1280|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Yes, I hadn't seen Tiki in a long time. Are you feeling well?|
1281|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Tiki|Uh... No. The bishop told me that I had to sleep again. But I don't want to... Because when I sleep I'm always alone. During my sleep, I dreamt many nightmares. There, I became a wild dragon, like those poor Fire Dragons and Ice Dragons. I attacked humans, and I killed them. No... No... When I awoke I was all alone in the dark room... I felt so strange, but also very scared... So very scared... But I couldn't leave that room. I cried many times, and then Uncle Bantu would come to comfort me as usual. One day he took me away, and took me to a human village. Living in that village was very fun, and everybody treated me well... In the short time, until I was discovered by Gharnef, I felt really happy. I don't want to sleep anymore... I feel that if I close my eyes once more, I will be unable to open them ever again. I don't want that. I want to live with everyone, I don't want to sleep again!|
1282|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Tiki, it's alright now. I will protect you, so don't cry...|
1283|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Tiki|Really...? I won't need to see those scary dreams again!?|
1284|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|That's right! Once the shield is restored, Tiki can live together with the rest of us. Don't worry, believe in me!|
1285|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Tiki|Ah! I'm so happy!! Thank you, Marth!|
1286|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Is that so...? So Tiki was that happy? It must have been hard for her, living like that. Although it was to protect that child, I did many bad things. She must hate me... Marth, you may leave. I will use my magic to send you to Altea instantly.|
1287|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Gotoh, aren't you coming along with us?|
1288|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Oh... I have something to investigate right now. You see, Gharnef has already began to act.|
1289|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Gharnef...!? But isn't he dead?|
1290|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Yes, his body was destroyed, but his vile spirit lives on in the Darksphere. He has also awakened the evil priests that served him, and they appear to be planning something terrible.|
1291|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Really...? I see, Gotoh. Well, we'll move out then.|
1292|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Mmm... Once I find anything, I will contact you immediately. Good luck, Marth. verything is in your hands. Please rescue dragons and humans from the path to ruin.|
1293|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Marth, you may leave. I will use my magic to send you to Altea instantly.|
1294|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Gotoh, aren’t you coming along with us?|
1295|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Oh… I have something to investigate right now. You see, Gharnef has already began to act.|
1296|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Gharnef…!? But isn’t he dead?|
1297|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Yes, his body was destroyed, but his vile spirit lives on in the Dark Orb. He has also awakened the evil priests that served him, and they appear to be planning something terrible.|
1298|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Really…? I see, Gotoh. Well, we’ll move out then.|
1299|FE3BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Mmm… Once I find anything, I will contact you immediately. Good luck, Marth. Everything is in your hands. Please rescue dragons and humans from the path to ruin.|
1300|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|Jagen, where is this? Is this Macedon, or Dolhr?|
1301|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Jagen|We're right at the countries' border. This is where Macedon's wyverns are born. However, these lands are ruled by savage barbarians. Even Macedon's soldiers are afraid to enter here.|
1302|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|So this is the Wyvern's Dale... Anyway, Jagen, we need to hurry. I feel like something is going to happen to my sister and the others. I have a bad feeling.|
1303|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Young Man|On the other side of the mountains is a small hill, called the Dragon's Table. Recently, there have been eerie roaring sounds coming from there. Grandfather and the others are afraid a demon is about to awaken. You mustn't get to close to that place.|
1304|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Man|This is the Wyvern's Dale. Don't go any further. Otherwise I fear you'll be burnt to death by the wyverns.|
1305|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|Prince Michalis!? What are you doing here? And you've suffered a grave wound. What happened?|
1306|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Michalis|...Marth... ...I have been waiting... for you...|
1307|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|Huh!?|
1308|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Michalis|...Take this...|
1309|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|...! This is the Starlight tome. You're giving it to me!?|
1310|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Michalis|That's right... Gharnef... Only with this spell can he be harmed. I managed to take it back from his possession...|
1311|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|Gharnef!? Where is he now?|
1312|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Michalis|The Dragon's Table... Ha... I was careless... I could be... Defeated by Gharnef... Marth... Good luck... I'm already finished. If Minerva is still around... Tell her to... In my place... Rescue Maria...|
1313|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|Michalis!|
1314|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Michalis|Your highness... I leave Maria's fate to you... Urgh.|
1315|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|So this is the Dragon's Table, where the Divine Dragon Naga sealed away the Earth Dragons... But, wasn't Medeus the guardian of the atlar...?|
1316|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Gotoh|Medeus could not tolerate the humans' actions against the Manaketes. So he gathered the other dragon tribes and formed the Dolhr Empire, to destroy mankind. First he was defeated by Anri and second by you. But, Earth Dragons can't be destroyed easily due to their powerful life force... Medeus is now sleeping in the altar.|
1317|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|He's going to resurrect again!?|
1318|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Gotoh|No, even an Earth Dragon shouldn't wake within a hundred years. Medeus is now changing his form. When he next awakens, he will become a fearful Shadow Dragon... No... Could it be... So that's why... Why Gharnef...|
1319|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|Huh, what is it Gotoh!?|
1320|FE3BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Gotoh|Prince Marth, I finally understand why the clerics have been taken. Gharnef plans to use them to resurrect Medeus. To awaken a dragon requires the life force of females with pure and noble blood. Gharnef knew about this, so he went to capture the clerics. Mmm... Marth, we must hurry. The clerics are in grave danger. Medeus... He is going to resurrect once again!!|
1321|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Lang|Heh heh heh... So the Alteans have come. Reinforcements are arriving soon; if we can hold out a little longer, we can make a pincer attack. Swordsman Navarre. When they open that door, you make your move. There is no need for restraint; slice them to pieces!|
1322|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Navarre|Yeah... sure. Though the knights of Altea are hardly worthy enemies.|
1323|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Lang|Oh-ho! That's my Navarre. They say not even Ogma of Talys is your equal.|
1324|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Navarre|What? Ogma?! N... Naturally... A guy like him is no match for me.|
1325|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Lang|I see. Glad to hear it. Then I'll leave this place in your capable hands, Navarre!|
1326|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Caeda|Navarre, please hear me out! Lend your sword to our case, just once more!|
1327|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Navarre|What? Who are you? I'll have no business with women or children... But, there's a first for everything... (Whoa, she's smoking!) What business do you have with me?|
1328|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Caeda|...... Y-you're not Navarre! Who are you?|
1329|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Samuel|Yikes, I've been exposed, huh? I'm actually a stingy mercenary known as Samuel. Somehow, I keep getting mistaken for this famous "Navarre" swordsman guy. I got tired of it after a while, so I decided to pose as him and got myself hired. But I don't like this General Lang guy either. If you're alright with it, I'll lend you my sword.|
1330|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Caeda|Yes... You'll do just fine...|
1331|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Ogma|Navarre... You bastard...|
1332|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Navarre|Stay away... This evening, my killing edge hungers for blood...|
1333|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Ogma|Do you mean to kill me, no matter what? Hmph, very well. I knew that we'd have to settle our score eventually.|
1334|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Samuel|Wait... Stay your blade! ...I'm no Navarre, I'm just a sham. I... it's me, Samuel. Have you forgotten, Ogma?|
1335|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Ogma|Samuel?! Samuel, the gladiator from Knorda?|
1336|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Samuel|Yes, I was a slave gladiator at the time, and you really helped me out. Even when everyone was making their escape, you stayed behind to distract the guards and ended up caught...|
1337|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Ogma|......|
1338|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Samuel|I heard everything from my friends. How you were dragged out to the square and whipped until you looked like a corpse. How, by chance, the young Princess Talys, tears in her eyes, stood up for you and saved you. And that's why you swore your blade to Talys. Or rather... to the princess...|
1339|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Ogma|Enough... Say no more! No more. It's in the past now... No more...|
1340|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Samuel|...Ogma... Anyway, I want to repay you! I'm following you from now on, okay?|
1341|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Navarre|I pity your soul. But I can at least grant you a quick death. Take this! My killing edge!!|
1342|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Samuel|Doh, I shouldn't have said that I was Navarre...|
1343|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Lang|W-wait, please! I'm sorry... Please forgive me... I've only done as the Emperor ordered me to. I didn't agree with him, but I had no choice. So... so please, s-spare my life... I'll do anything you say. Yes... Just like this... Mwahaha! You shouldn't have let your guard down! You fool... Now die!|
1344|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Lang|Urgh... Impossible... I have been defeated...|
1345|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|Lord Wendell! Thank goodness you're unharmed.|
1346|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Wendell|Lang accused me of collaborating with the rebels and had me imprisoned. Even though I told him that I must fulfill a mission assigned to me by Archsage Gotoh...|
1347|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|A mission from Lord Gotoh?|
1348|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Wendell|That's correct... You have seen the "Starsphere"--the holy orb with the twelve constellations etched on its surface. In order to pierce Gharnef's shadowy veil, Lord Gotoh created a sacred spell named "Starlight" from that orb.|
1349|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Wendell|Unfortunately, the strain on the Starsphere was so severe that it shattered into twelve shards, which scattered into the sky. Lord Gotoh told me that this world has long been guarded by five orbs of mysterious arcane power, and that if even one of them is lost, the world will fall into irreparable ruin. By any means possible, we must gather the twelve star shards and restore the Starsphere.|
1350|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|Is... Is this a joke? That the world could just end... This is all very hard to take in. But aren't these the star shards? If so, we already have a few. After we retake Altea, we'd be glad to help you find the remaining shards and orbs.|
1351|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Wendell|Of course... Your country was only just invaded by the Empire... I understand, Prince... I too shall fight to restore Altea, then. Thinking about it, my meeting with you is like a sign from Lord Gotoh himself. In that case, I shall surrender myself to fate. But, please, let's stop by the Fane of Raman. We may be able to find some star shards in the ancient temple.|
1352|FE3BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|Understood. If it's the Fane of Raman, we can go there on our way to Altea!|
1353|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|Jagen, we’ve finally arrived. Is that the rebels’ fortress?|
1354|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Jagen|I just saw the occupation army’s commander, General Lang. You should ask him directly.|
1355|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lang|So you are Lord Marth. Currently the situation is relaxed. We have already subdued most of the rebels. All that remains is this fortress. Since you are here, I will leave the job of defeating the rebels’ leader, General Lorenz, to you.|
1356|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|What?! General Lorenz leads the rebels?! What would possess him to rebel of all things?!|
1357|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lang|Who knows? I haven't the foggiest idea, and frankly I don't care. Prince. You are to kill General Lorenz, and reclaim the children of the Grustian royal family that he's hiding. While you do that... We will slaughter the families of those who participated in this rebellion and raze their homes to the ground.|
1358|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|Are you insane?! They're innocent civilians!|
1359|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lang|"I-insane"!? Young man, are you questioning my orders?! Perhaps Altea, too, plans to rebel against Archanea...?|
1360|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|Of course not! That's not...|
1361|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lang|Prince Marth, your tiny country means absolutely nothing to me. Your rude behaviour is merely an irritation. Do not forget that I have the power of the empire behind me: I can crush weak, pesky insects like you any time I wish.|
1362|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|…Jagen, what’s going on? Why has Hardin handed over this country to such a man…?|
1363|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Jagen|General Lang was once a noble of Archanea. However, in the previous war, he supported the Dolhrian Empire. I heard that he stole from other people, to add to his own wealth. I fear he has continued his ways at Grust, and caused suffering to its people. So General Lorenz’s rebellion is completely understandable.|
1364|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|Jagen! How can you say things so casually? If we don’t inform Hardin of the truth, more innocent people will be killed.|
1365|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Jagen|Your highness, I understand your feelings. However, Lorenz’s rebellion is a fact. First, we must see how we can help him. Basically we should listen to what the citizens have to say, so we can affirm what has happened to this country. Then your highness can talk to General Lorenz personally.|
1366|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|But the rebels don’t know that we’re from Altea. Can we reach the fortress safely?|
1367|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Jagen|Don’t worry. Most of the rebels have already fled. All that remains is Lorenz, and the children in the fortress. Blocking our path are only bandits, who have taken advantage of the confusion to raid villages. They are no problem for us. You can order Alen to defeat them in one blow if you want. However, your highness, we have some fresh recruits in our army that could use some fighting experience. To them, bandits are relatively strong foes. So be careful not to push them too much. If possible, I would have liked to fight as well, but my body is not what it used to be. I will stay by your highness’s side, as your tactician. Well, your highness, we should go!|
1368|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Villager|After the last war, Princess Nyna let this country keep its sovereignty under the rule of General Lorenz. However, as soon as Hardin became emperor, General Lorenz was banished and Lang's troops came crawling in. Lang stole everything from us. He stole our gold, of course, but he even stole our food and our loved ones... Ah... If only General Camus were here! Then we wouldn't have to live in fear of people like Lang!|
1369|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Villager|There aren't any young girls left in this country. They were all taken away by the imperial troops. They say General Lang keeps the really pretty ones to himself. What a dark, insane chapter in Grust's history...|
1370|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Villager|The late King Grust had two children. Princess Yuliya and Prince Jubelo. They're still young. Maybe thirteen, or fourteen; cute little twins, both of them. In the last war, Gharnef, the Dark Pontifex, kidnapped the twins to blackmail the king. They were taken to Khadein, the city of magic, and locked away in a pitch-black room. At great personal risk, Pontifex Wendell saved them. He took them to a monastery to protect them.|
1371|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Villager|General Lorenz took the royal children from Lord Wendell and raised them in Grust. The empire demanded their extradition, but Lorenz was afraid they would be killed, and hid them. The empire branded Lorenz a traitor, and sent General Lang here. Lang did horrible things to find the royal children. That's why we rose up. But, we lost. And now Lang is going to kill everyone in this entire country!|
1372|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Villager|I heard that General Lorenz lived in Talys when he was young. Talys wasn't unified at the time, so there were a number of noble houses contending for control. Lorenz lent his power to the young patriarch of one house, and together they unified Talys into one country. Lorenz and that patriarch--now the king of Talys--remain close friends to this day.|
1373|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Villager|I only saw him briefly, but that knight, Arran, looked awfully pale. You know, he's probably hit the wall, so to speak. I doubt he'll get any stronger, no matter how much he fights...|
1374|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Villager|Oh... Please, show mercy to just this child. She's only ten years old.|
1375|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|Ma'am, please calm yourself. I am not here to take any children.|
1376|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Villager|What... You're not imperial soldiers?|
1377|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|No... We're not. We didn't come to fight. If there's anything you need, please ask. It's not much, but we can give you food.|
1378|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marisha|Wait... Please, take me with you...|
1379|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|Huh...? You're... Are you really ten?|
1380|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marisha|No... I'm a grown woman, but Granny lied so that I wouldn't be taken away by the soldiers. Lang's soldiers are all monstrous. But you're different. You have very sweet eyes. Please, take me with you. I want you to take me away from this country, and take me to yours.|
1381|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Villager|It's not safe for her to stay here. Please take her with you, and protect her. You can marry her, too, if you like. Marisha is a beautiful, good-natured lady, just like me! I'm sure she'll make a fine wife.|
1382|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marisha|No-no-no! Granny, it's far too early for that! Now you've made Marisha all flustered!|
1383|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Bandit|Oh? A battle, is it? We're in luck, boys! Let's loot 'em villages before 'ey realize what's hit 'em!|
1384|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|Alright, that will do for now... Sir Ogma, please forgive me for getting you involved in this mess.|
1385|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Ogma|I am here on King Talys's orders. As such, I will do everything in my power to help.|
1386|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|I see... Then I have a favor to ask of you. I want you to escort these children to Macedon. These children... Prince Jubelo and Princess Yuliya, are King Grust's orphans. Please. Take them safely to Lord Wendell in Macedon.|
1387|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Ogma|Understood... I will guard these two with my life.|
1388|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|Thank you, Sir Ogma... Now, Prince Jubelo, Princess Yuliya, you will be leaving with Sir Ogma.|
1389|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Yuliya|No! I'm not going! I won't leave you behind!|
1390|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|Princess... I cannot go. With this wound, I can barely even walk. It saddens me, but you two must go on without me.|
1391|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Yuliya|You took that grievous wound to protect us... How can you tell us to just leave you behind now?! I will never leave. We will never leave your side, Lorenz!!|
1392|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Ogma|What shall I do, General?|
1393|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|Hmm... this is most troublesome. Princess Yuliya is not one to change her mind easily... We will remain here.|
1394|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Ogma|In that case, I will find some other way to help you. I will find Lang and bring him down... I will bury him with this sword, I swear on it. General Lorenz, you must hold out until then...!|
1395|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|Prince Marth! So it is you... How unfortunate, that I must fight... the Altean army and its prince...|
1396|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|Please, wait. I do not wish to fight with you. I heard about everything from the villagers. I've heard of all the atrocities Archanea has committed. I promise, I will inform Emperor Hardin of the truth and rescue Grust. So please, lower your weapons.|
1397|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|Prince... I am grateful for the offer. But, I am afraid that I cannot comply. Prince, you know nothing. Do you think that a man of Emperor Hardin's caliber would make a general out of a man as worthless as Lang without good reason? He called for an invasion: to crush the kingdom of Grust and make it a territory of the Empire.|
1398|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|No, it can't be! Hardin would never do something like that.|
1399|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|I know it's hard to believe. But I'm afraid that, ever since he became emperor, he has changed a great deal. He is no longer the Hardin you once knew. Prince, I have one final request of you. In this stronghold, I am protecting the young prince and princess of Grust. Please, find a way to help them. If you can do just that, I will have no regrets.|
1400|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|What... General Lorenz, what are you saying...?!|
1401|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|Prince Marth... My life in exchange for theirs... By any means necessary, please help them... This is the last thing I will ask.|
1402|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|General Lorenz!! ......This can't be happening......|
1403|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|What?! You're... the Altean army?! So even Altea has turned on us...|
1404|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|Forgive me, people of Grust...|
1405|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Elder|Prince Marth... General Lorenz entrusted everything to you. You spared his life, and even heard him out. We, the people of Grust, thank you. Please, let me offer you a token of our gratitude. Here. We're protecting Prince Jubelo and Princess Yuliya in this stronghold. I beg you, do what you must to protect our last fragments of hope...|
1406|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|You, you're... Grust's royal heirs... Prince Jubelo and Princess Yuliya?!|
1407|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Jubelo|Sniff... Lorenz... He's gone... How can we live on without him?|
1408|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Yuliya|You monsters!! Stay away! You're going to murder us just like you murdered Lorenz!!|
1409|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|No, you have it all wrong!! We just...|
1410|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lang|Ah... Prince Marth. You finally caught these filthy traitors.|
1411|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|General Lang! Wait, please! These children have done nothing wrong. Allow me to take custody of them.|
1412|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lang|Don't make me laugh. These brats are coming with me to my castle. Besides, my dear prince, you have other, more important, priorities. I have received reports that there has been a military revolt in Macedon, and Princess Minerva has been imprisoned.|
1413|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|What...?! How could that happen to Macedon?! I understand my obligations, General Lang. Still, these children... Let them stay with me, please.|
1414|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lang|Prince, do not try my patience! Listen up you two! You're coming with me!|
1415|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Yuliya|No, let me go!! Jubelo... help me!!|
1416|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Jubelo|Yuliya... Yuliya...!!|
1417|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|Wait!! Lang! Release them at once!|
1418|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Kris|Sire! Give me the order, and I'll get them safely back at once!|
1419|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Jagen|Sire, don't do it!! You too, Kris! If we oppose Lang right here, right now, we run the risk of being branded traitors by Archanea.|
1420|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|But Jagen, are you telling me to simply allow Lang to take them?! I cannot stand for that...|
1421|FE3BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Jagen|I understand how you feel, sire... But please remain patient for a little longer. If we head to Macedon... then rescue Princess Minerva, Macedon will surely lend us its strength.|
1422|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Roshea|Wolf, Sedgar, Vyland. Is this really okay...? Can we really fight this battle?|
1423|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Wolf|Roshea! What are you trying to say? Look, the Altean army is marching long the narrow mountain road. Now's our only chance to defeat them.|
1424|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Vyland|Yes, Roshea. We swore that we could sacrifice our lives for Lord Hardin. Lord Hardin was the one who freed us plains people from slavery. If we don't fight Altea now, Millennium Court will fall. Do you want Lord Hardin to be defeated by them?|
1425|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Sedgar|That's right! Prince Marth wants to destroy Archanea, and conquer the world. And that's why he joined forces with Macedon to crust Grust. Now he even has Gra under his rule. If we don't do something, the whole world will fall under his control.|
1426|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Roshea|I still don't believe it. I cannot believe Prince Marth would have such ambitions.|
1427|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Wolf|What? Are you saying that Emperor Hardin lied? Do you think that he would stoop to such a low!? Enough, Roshea!! You disappoint me, if you want to betray us then go ahead. Sedgar, Vyland, let's go. If we're too slow, they will pass us.|
1428|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Roshea|Hey, wait! I won't betray you. I understand... I'll go.|
1429|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|King Aurelis|Oh, Prince Marth. It is good to see you.|
1430|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|Huh, aren't you King Aurelis?! What are you doing here?|
1431|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|King Aurelis|I came here to stop my country's army. Also I must apologise to your highness. I believed Hardin's words and followed Archanea, but I now realize my wrongs. Archanea's Empress Nyna secretly sent me a letter, saying that Hardin isn't normal and is ill... My country will remain neutral, and its knights will return to Aurelis. I hope you won't attack my men anymore.|
1432|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|I understand, your highness. I don't want to fight with you. Please forgive me for taking so many of your knights' lives.|
1433|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|King Aurelis|Oh! You really are like what the rumors say. My body is frail and I have no children, and even Hardin, my younger brother, has completely changed. Prince Marth, please protect Aurelis in my place. I will hand my whole country to you. I give this jewel to you as a gift. This is a magical jewel containing the divine power of life. I spent a lot of gold to buy it from a travelling merchant. I believe it will be useful to you. Don't worry about Hardin. Since he is a knight, it is natural for him to die in battle. That is his fate. Well, Prince Marth, I will go on ahead. I hop you will all be safe...|
1434|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Roshea|I am Roshea of the Aurelis knights. I don't want to fight, but I can't betray my companions. Please forgive me...|
1435|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Vyland|As long as we're here, we won't let you get to Millennium Court. If you don't want to die, run back to your country!|
1436|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Sedgar|You... Why are you invading other countries? Have you been blinded by ambition?|
1437|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Wolf|The leader of Aurelis' knights, Wolf, is here for your head!|
1438|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Wolfguard|Lord Hardin...|
1439|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|Jagen, it seems we've finally crossed the peak. Millennium Court isn't far from here.|
1440|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Jagen|Yes, if we go down from here, we will reach the capital of Millennium Court in an instant. Also, your highness, I just received news of an attempted coup in Millennium Court. The knights and civilians who opposed Hardin's actions rebelled against him. It seems their leader was Lady Midia.|
1441|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|What! Midia...? What happened?|
1442|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Jagen|Unfortunately Lady Midia was defeated and was captured... Each day many people are executed. It is only a matter of time before Lady Midia shares the same fate.|
1443|FE3BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|Damn, Hardin... I can't believe that he would do that. Alright, let's go and rescue Midia! We must hurry to Millennium Court and end this once and for all. Jagen, let's go!!|
1444|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Soldier|General, the missing Altean remnants have finally returned.|
1445|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Eibel|Really? Haha...! What good timing. We will follow our original plan. Have Gra's soldiers move out to lure them and then defeat them in one go.|
1446|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Soldier|Understood, but, what about "him"?|
1447|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Eibel|The paladin, Abel? It doesn't matter if he betrays me! If he does, you will kill the female hostage!! He has already retired from the army. He won't swear loyalty to the prince again. Ha ha...! How will they avoid fighting Abel...? This will be very interesting to watch...|
1448|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Old Man|In the forts are many enemies. Don't be careless.|
1449|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Woman|Oh, you... Where did you all go to? You all went missing for so long that everyone became very worried about you.|
1450|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Young Man|The Kingdom of Gra views Altea as its enemy. But, in reality, they were forced to fight because of their alliance with Archanea.|
1451|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Woman|After Altea fell, Elice was taken to an unknown place by a black-robed bishop... Oh... Princess Elice... I pray that you are safe and well...|
1452|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Young Woman|Since being ruled by the imperial army, our days have been difficultly passed. But, we all believed that Lord Marth would definitely come back for us. He would rescue us all from our suffering... Because, our Lord Marth is the warrior of light chosen by the deities... the Starlord!|
1453|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Young Man|Nearby are enemy spies. Be careful! They will come from the forts.|
1454|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Young Man|The mercenaries protecting the castle are Altea's elites. It would be great if they could become your allies.|
1455|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Man|Oh, your highness, you've finally come. I have been waiting, to give this to you. However this village and the neighboring village...|
1456|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|Mmm, I understand. But, for the sake of everyone, you should start to make up with them...|
1457|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Abel|Your highness... Please forgive me... I don't want to lose Est...|
1458|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Abel|Est...|
1459|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|Abel!? Why are you... I don't believe this, you're betraying your homeland!?|
1460|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Abel|Lord Marth... Please forgive me... They took Est... If I didn't fight... They would kill her. ...But after meeting your highness, I can no longer... fight... against Altea... Est... I'm sorry, please forgive me!!|
1461|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Est|Abel... I’m sorry, you must have suffered.|
1462|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Abel|Est!! You’re safe.|
1463|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Est|Yes, Lord Marth rescued me. I’m alright now.|
1464|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Abel|Really...? Damn, Archanea... But how should I apologize to Lord Marth…?|
1465|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Est|I’m sorry... It was all because of me.|
1466|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Abel|No, Est! It was nothing to do with you!! Those fools... I won’t forgive them... I’ll show them how deep my anger is!!|
1467|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Eibel|What! Being able to defeat my great army. Are you even human?|
1468|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Eibel|My Archanea army could be defeated...?|
1469|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|That was a fierce battle. Is everybody alright?|
1470|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Jagen|Don't worry, they have been awaiting this day for a long time.|
1471|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|Archanea's actions were too cold-hearted. They even had innocent citizens killed. How can I apologise to the citizens...? I only bring trouble to everybody... Perhaps I'm not fit to protect this country.|
1472|FE3BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Jagen|No, your highness, you're wrong! Your highness, you have a gentle heart, so that is why no matter what hardships, we can endure them. We believe in your highness, so that is why we follow you. Your highness, please raise your spirit!! We still haven't reclaimed Altea castle. There are probably many enemies awaiting us, but this is our castle. We already know how to fight this battle. Well, Lord Marth! Let's go!!|
1473|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|What's going on...? Even thieves have managed to find their way in. Could the Geosphere have been taken by them!?|
1474|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jagen|Your highness, a suspicious thief is escaping towards the north. We should send somebody in pursuit before it's too late.|
1475|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|Mmm, but we can't use horses or Pegasi inside, so what should we do...|
1476|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Astram|You foul traitors! Taste the might of my Mercurius!|
1477|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Astram|Midia...|
1478|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jeorge|Astram, how are you doing?|
1479|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Astram|So it's the traitor, Jeorge. What do you want with me?|
1480|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jeorge|Wait, Astram. General Eibel has already fallen. You won't be able to win even if you continue fighting.|
1481|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Astram|You want me to surrender...? Never! Even if I am the last one standing. I am a warrior of Archanea to the end!!|
1482|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jeorge|Why are you... Who are you fighting for? Are you fighting for Emperor Hardin?|
1483|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Astram|No! It's not because of that man, but because of Nyna... And for Archanea!!|
1484|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jeorge|But, did Nyna tell you to fight here? Do you really think that Nyna would hope for this kind of battle?|
1485|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Astram|Well... I hadn't seen Nyna for a while. I was told that she fell ill, and that I couldn't see her. But... Since Hardin is Emperor of Archanea, I have no choice. If I don't follow his orders I will become a traitor, and I will be betraying Nyna.|
1486|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jeorge|Astram, Nyna already entrusted the Emblem to Prince Marth. Do you understand the meaning of her actions?|
1487|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Astram|Wh-what!! When did this happen, Jeorge? Nyna requested Prince Marth for help?|
1488|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jeorge|I believe that is the only explanation. Astram, if you want to find out the truth then come with us... If you die here, what will Midia do? You must live on, for her. You must live on, so you can confirm with your eyes what is happening.|
1489|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Astram|Hmm... I guess I have no choice. But, Jeorge. If this war is as Hardin said, and was caused by Prince Marth's ambitions. I will never forgive you! Remember that!!|
1490|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Willow|Hahaha... It's time for me to show you... The destructive power of my Meteor magic...|
1491|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Willow|Emperor Hardin, forgive me...|
1492|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jagen|Prince Marth. The enemies in the castle have been vanquished. Altea is finally in our hands again.|
1493|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|Really? That's great. But, I stil don't see my sister...|
1494|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Gotoh|Your highness, Princess Elice was taken by Gharnef.|
1495|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|Huh? Gotoh, is that true!?|
1496|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Gotoh|He ordered the dark priests to search for clerics of noble birth. Lena, Maria... and even your sister Elice. They have all been taken by Gharnef...|
1497|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|Is that so... But what is he planning on doing by capturing them?|
1498|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Gotoh|That I don't know, but I bet it's not anything good. The chain of events so far was all the doing of Gharnef.|
1499|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|Gotoh! Where is he now?|
1500|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Gotoh|I don't know, but I bet Gharnef's next target will be Princess Nyna. So he is probably at Millennium Court...|
1501|FE3BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|I see. We will go to Millennium Court. I will rescue Hardin from the Darksphere's influence. I will defeat Gharnef and the dark priests... And I will rescue the captured clerics!!|
