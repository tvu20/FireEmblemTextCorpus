FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Marth,"Countless days have passed since Dolhr took my kingdom from me- days I would never have lived had it not been for my sister Elice's sacrifice, and the sacrifices of so many others...",negative
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Nyna,"What became of your sister? And the rest of your family, what of them as well?",neutral
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Marth,"My father, as you know, died in Gra. I last saw my mother and sister the day the castle fell. I do not know if they still live...but I hope that they do. And if the enemy has them, I will rescue them. You can be sure of that.",negative
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Malledus,"Sire, our preparations are complete. We are ready to march.",neutral
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Marth,Thank you.,positive

FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Old Man,"Listen well, because this is very important. There are two villages in the northwest of Altea. The easterly village is home to a paladin named Arran while the westerly village is home to a hero named Samson. They're both fine men and warriors, but their villages have been feudin' for years. You should probably resign yourself to the fact that you'll only get one of them to join your ranks. Give it some thought: the hero to the west, or the paladin to the east?",neutral
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Young Girl,"A VIP card will gain you entrance to secret shops. Where are the shops? Well, that’s the secret!",neutral
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Young Man,A lad named Xane has been locked up in the eastern jail. They say he’s got some sort of amazing power. Wonder what it is.,positive

FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Young Man,"Princess Elice was prepared to die that day the castle fell. But she didn't, they say. Instead of killin' her, the Dark Pontifex Gharnef spirited her off somewhere! Oh, our poor princess... I hope she's safe.",negative
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Samson,"My name is Samson. Once, I was a swordfighter of some renown...but that was then, and this is now. I'm happy enough with my life here in the village, but if you need another man, I will fight. Unfortunately, there has always been bad blood between our village and the next one over. They'll have closed the gates to you the moment they saw you come here. Guess that means the paladin Arran won't be fightin' with you. Them's the breaks.",negative
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Arran,"Sire, my name is Arran. Once I was a captain to many knights... but, things change, and I came to live here in this village. If you need warriors for the coming struggle, I would be honored to fight. Unfortunately, there has always been bad blood between this village and our neighbors. No doubt they closed their gates to you as soon as they saw you come here. You won't be able to recruit the hero Samson now, I'm afraid.",negative
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Xane,"Hey there, princey. Thanks for settin' me free! The name's Xane. I hail from a land few have heard of an even fewer have seen. I won't trouble you with the details. Me and my folk have the power to transform into other people. We can shape-shift, you see. When Doluna caught on, they started threatenin' me. Told me to join their army or ""face my doom."" Hah! Well, I wasn't about to waste my considerable talent on those evil coots! You, on the other hand...You've got character. Say, why don't we team up? I do owe you for savin' my hide. And I think you'll find my talents are...quite considerable.",positive
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Hollstadt,"Well done, rabble. Anyone else would be dead by now. A shame you must end your campaign right here, before your own gates!",negative

FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Marth,"Thank you, Nyna. But it's still too soon to celebrate. We haven't freed the castle yet.",positive
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Malledus,"Sire, your soldiers have assembled for the castle raid. Perhaps you could say a few words first...",neutral
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Marth,"Altean warriors... Brave comrades. The road has been long, but at last we have driven Dolhr from my homeland. There are not words to express my gratitude to you all. You gave Altea back to me. Thank you... Thank you. ...An army of foes still haunt my castle. I mean to kick them out. Ready, my friends? Let's send these varlets scurrying!",negative
FE11,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Ogma,"Prince Marth, I am Ogma, a mercenary of Talys. The king has bid me and my three men join your army. Cavalry has arrived from the west, flying Grust’s standard. They mean to take your life, sire. Be careful.",negative
FE11,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Young Man,A pirate callin’ himself Darros wants to talk to your prince. Says he’s washed his hands of pillagin’ and plunderin’ and wants to fight for the good of all. Hah! Right… And I’m a farmer who’s been sworn off rain…,negative

Just promise you’ll use it to bring her home to us unharmed.",negative
FE11,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Darros,"Ahoy, Prince Marth, I be Darros, a simple man o’ the sea. I’ve had me fill o’ the piratin’ life, and now I be lookin’ t’start anew. What say ye? Make me yer matey, and I swear t’pull me load.",negative

FE11,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Caeda,I never got to thank you for coming along with us. There's no swordsman I trust more. I've seen your strength.,positive
FE11,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Ogma,"You don't need to thank me, Princess. I'm just doing my job. Speaking of which, your father would flay me if you came to any harm. Do me a favor, and leave the dangerous fighting to me and my men.",positive

FE11,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Villager,"You have our gratitude, sire, for finally chasin’ those pirates away. Now, as I hear it, you plan to march on to Aurelis…That’ll take you right up through the Ghoul’s Teeth. With all due respect, sire, you’re taking a great risk crossin’ those mountains that’s Soothsire territory. The Soothsires are fearsome bandits, always raidin’ the villages and harryin’ what travelers dare pass by. And the swordsman with ’em- goes by the name o’ Navarre- he’s a terror with a blade, so they say. If you go up there, keep your wits about you- or you won’t come back down.",negative
FE11,01-MarthEmbarks,Jagen,Sire! You've a visitor from the castle. It's Princess Caeda!,neutral
FE11,01-MarthEmbarks,Marth,"Caeda, what is it? You look white as a sheet!",neutral

FE11,01-MarthEmbarks,Young Man,"A knight belongs on the front lines, if you ask me. That thick armor can take a lot of abuse, so they should be up front protecting the other units.",neutral
FE11,01-MarthEmbarks,Teenage Boy,"Galder? That's the harbor town west of Talys out beyond the water. These days, a pirate by the name of Gomer calls the shots there. The whole town's at the mercy of his crew.",neutral

FE11,01-MarthEmbarks,Talys King,"Ah, Prince Marth! You have saved us in our hour of need. Please accept my thanks. Lad, I believe you are ready. If you wish to seek out allies in Aurelis, I will give you what soldiers I can to see you arrive there safely. Captain Ogma is a fine swordsman, brave and true. I know he and his fighters will serve you well. Another thing...During your travels, you are certain to meet many who despise Dolhr. Some may be hiding in villages; other may have been captured or forced to fight against their will or better judgment. It falls upon you to find these individuals and win them over your cause. Understood, lad? Then go! The time has come! Be patient, steady, strong: I know you will do great things.",positive

FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Old Man,Why would you try to take on an entire army just for our sake?,neutral

FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Ymir,"You just keep your distance. I’m not letting anyone near the villagers in here, and that includes you!",negative
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Marth,"You wrong me, sir. I’m here to rout the last of Grust’s army. To save you.",negative
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Ymir,"Yeah? Well, they said the same thing when they led us down here. And look where that got us. I’m not fallin’ for the same lies twice!",negative
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Marth,"I speak the truth. But, if my word is not good enough, so be it. Stand aside and watch us fight. Let the battle prove I mean what I say. Agreed? Either way, you are in danger here. Take the villagers and hide until this is over.",negative

FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Larissa,We’ll never surrender to you Akaneian rabble! Long live Grust!,negative
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Larissa,Rebel... scum...,negative
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Old Man,"Prince Marth, thank you. Those soldiers told us they’d protect us when they led us down here... but they were just using us as leverage, hostages to keep you at bay! If you hadn’t shown up, they might have just killed us outright in the end...",positive
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Ymir,"Prince Marth, sorry I doubted you.",negative
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Marth,"Well, at least we’ve cleared up the misunderstanding.",neutral
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Ymir,"Since you came to the villagers’ rescue, how ’bout I help you out as a way of sayin’ thanks?",positive
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Marth,You mean... join our army?,neutral
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Ymir,"I’m strongest in the land! Well, second strongest, at least. I can hold my own in battle. But if you don’t want a monster in your ranks, I understand...",negative
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Marth,"Monster? You’re a giant among men, to be sure, but a hero as well! Any warrior who can fend of an entire army is welcome among us!",positive

FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Malledus,"Aurelis, at last…The enemy will have sent their forces to meet us.",neutral
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Marth,"Grust, Dolhr, Gra..We’re up against their standing armies, and we must brace ourselves for it.",negative
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Malledus,"Sire, I believe it prudent that we start taking time to prepare our troops before each battle. We should select the warriors best suited for the situation and outfit them with the right weapons and items accordingly.",neutral
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Marth,"All right, that’s sound advice- I believe I’ll take it.",neutral
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Bentheon,"An unknown army to the south? That must be the Altean princeling and his band of lickspittles. If they think we’ll sit by and let them join forces with the Aurelians, then they have another think coming. With this ridersbane, I’ll litter the lea with their cavalry!",neutral
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Young Man,"Weapons can be crafted of iron, steel, or silver, each metal more powerful than the last. You’’l need to raise your weapon level accordingly, though, before you can use them.",neutral
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Middle-Aged Man,"When facing armored knights or generals, you’ll want to arm yourself with a sword they call an armorslayer. Then there’s the ridersbane, which makes short work of cavaliers and paladins- but only knights and cavalry can wield it. The rapier is effective against armored units AND cavalry. But you need to be a prince to wield that one! Also, keep in mind that weapons wear down with use and eventually break.",neutral
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Young Man,"General Bentheon who guards the castle was carrying a ridersbane last I saw. Keep your cavaliers away, or that weapon could spell the end of ‘em.",neutral

FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Marth,"…Huh? Merric?! Merric, is that you?",neutral

FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Matthis,"I’m not here by choice, sister of mine. Since you left, Macedon has only gotten worse and worse. They forced me to enlist- you know I hate warfare, but it was into the army or onto the chopping block.",negative
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Lena,"Shame on you, Matthis. If you’re going to fight, then at least fight for something you believe in. Medon has done terrible things: marrying their might to Doluna, helping them torment people…Brother, it’s not too late. You could join Altea’s forces. They’re good people you know. Prince Marth would welcome you. They all would.",negative
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Matthis,"…All right, then. If I’m gonna to die, I’d rather die as one of the dashing than one of the dastardly. You know, Lena, you always were the reliable one and now you’re all grown up…I thought for sure you’d have already settled down with your one true love.",negative

FE11,XX-Epilogue,Caeda,"Marth... um, we haven't talked much since leaving Talys. But I thought.. Do you know where you will be going?",neutral
FE11,XX-Epilogue,Marth,"To Altea, of course. War has left my kingdom in ruins. I cannot waste another day; I must return to help rebuild.",negative

FE11,XX-Epilogue,Marth,"Well, that's where we both belong. I don't see what my wants have to do with anything.",neutral
FE11,XX-Epilogue,Nyna,"Clearly not. Marth, if you have anything to say to Caeda, say it now. Love cannot always make the leap from heart to heart by itself; sometimes you must speak it aloud and give it wings. Surely a great leader like you can muster the courage for that?",positive

FE11,XX-Epilogue,Nyna,"Marth, do not blame yourself. ...Remember Anri and Artemis. We are their descendants; perhaps we were always meant to share their curse as well as their blood.

However, ordinarily their draconic disposition stayed suppressed; their power sealed within special stones. Thus rather than terrorizing humankind, they chose to live simple, peaceful lives in the quieter reaches of the world. However, a century ago, something changed. Medeus, the Shadow Dragon, surfaced in the Dolhr region and created what would be a great empire there. His forces invaded the human realm, and in the blink of an eye, he had subjected all of the land. It was then, in that darkest hour, that a young man named Anri appeared, and rose against the Shadow Dragon. In his head was a shining blade of light- Falchion- which he plunged into Medeus- and the tyrant was no more. Anri went on to found Altea- and the rest, I believe, you know.",negative

FE11|09-ThePyrathiDragon|Mannu|Interlopers! Barbarous filth! They dare dig their heels and hooves into this hallowed ground? I will kill them for this- one by one- then turn the crimson grass beneath them into their pyre!|
FE11|09-ThePyrathiDragon|Teenage Boy|Your best chance of stopping a Manakete lies in what they call a wyrmslayer. It’s a type of sword, and I hear one is enshrined in the eastern palace.|
FE11|09-ThePyrathiDragon|Jeorge|Prince Marth, I am Jeorge, an Archanean sniper. I fought to defend our palace from Dolhr but the enemy’s strength was too great. We lost, and I was captured. Thankfully, they’re not half as bright as they are strong, and I managed to slip away when they were not looking. I heard you were on your way to Pyrathi, and that Princess Nyna was with you, so I came here to offer my help. Let me fight with you to save my land, and I will use this silver bow to show you marksmanship unlike any you’ve ever seen.|
FE11|09-ThePyrathiDragon|Mannu|Foolhardy humans, defying a Manakete king! Tremble now, and feel the last quickening of your heart!|
FE11|09-ThePyrathiDragon|Mannu|What...? Slain, by this fangless coward and his minions?|
FE11|09-ThePyrathiDragon|Catria|Prince Marth. I am Catria, of the Whitewinged Order of Macedon. I have come with a request from our mistress, the princess Minerva. She is planning to lead us against Dolhr in rebellion; however, her hands are tied so long as the enemy holds her younger sister, the princess Maria, captive. Will you rescue Princess Maria from their clutches, that my Whitewing sisters and I might join in your fight?|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Hardin|Princess Nyna, I’ve spotted them! The Altean army is on the far side of the river.|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Nyna|They’re here? At last! Prince Marth has come for us!|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Hardin|So it seems. Now, what say you we turn this battle around? I’m going to take my men east to join our might with Marth’s. Together we will retake the castle. Stay here, my lady, and wait for the good news.|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Old Man|A castle like ours must be chock full o’ royal treasure! Ah, but only a thief could get inside chests locked that tight…|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Old Woman|The shops in Port Warren feature wares both rare and beautiful. Be thrifty with your gold now if you’ve any plans to venture that way later! Also keep in mind that shops keep only a limited stock of some items; once they’re sold out, you can’t buy any more.|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Young Man|Word has it that the enemy is mustering its forces in the fortresses nearby. You’d better hurry and send units to bar their exits.|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Young Man|Well g’day, there, son! …Why the wide-eyed stare? Ain’cha never seen a country village before? You know, speakin’ o’ rare sights, I once went to Pyrathi, where I saw me a real live Manakete! Cripes, let me tell you what a shock THAT was! In a blink, this regular old feller turned into an enormous dragon! I mean, I ain’t stupid. I’d heard of the dragonkin before. I’d just always assumed Manaketes looked somethin’ like parakeets. Sheesh… …What? Oh, this? I picked this stone up while I was there. Dunno what it is, but how often do you spy a glowin’ red rock, ya know what I’m sayin’ But honestly, it’s been kinda creepin’ me out lately. You want it? Go on ‘n’ take it. Sheesh…|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Merric|Oh… Master Wendell! Teacher!|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Wendell|Well, hello, Merric! What a surprise! Good to see you haven’s blown yourself up yet.|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Merric|Not yet, sir. But I did find Prince Marth, just like I said I would. I’ve joined the Altean army in the fight against Dolhr. …Why are you here, Teacher?|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Wendell|Hmm… It’s Khadein, lad. The land is not as you remember it. That fiend Gharnef seized power, and now he’s draped the city in darkness. I fear Khadein is doomed… I could not stay and serve him. So, I snuck out alone.|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Merric|Very brave of you, sir. Hmm… Why don’t you join us, then? If Gharnef is helping Dolhr, then he’s a bitter enemy of ours as much as he is to yours and Khadein’s. We couldn’t possibly leave the city in his clutches. And I’m sure the prince would be pleased as pie to have magic as robust as yours in his arsenal.|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Wendell|Hmm, you do know how to argue a point. I’ve no taste for war, but war is what I’ve been served. Come, Merric. We’ll fight together. Tell your prince of Altea that Wendell is at his service.|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Wendell|Prince Marth, I am Wendell, a pontifex of Khadein, city of magic. Our pleas for peace have failed, and Khadein has been taken over by one of the other pontifices. His name is Gharnef, and he and the many mages who swear allegiance to him have allied themselves with Dolhr. Prince Marth, I ask you now: please lend me your help in thwarting his vile ambitions.|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Wendell|Prince Marth, I am Wendell, a pontifex of Khadein, City of Magic. Our pleas for peace have failed, and Khadein has been taken over by one of the other pontifices.

FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Marth|Lord Hardin, I am Marth of Altea. I’ve come to offer what help I can.|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Hardin|And I very gratefully accept it. Stories of your exploits travel fast, young prince. I feel as though I’ve gained a thousand allies in one.|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Marth|I’ve heard a few stories of you as well, Coyote. It will be an honor to fight alongside such a courageous man.|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Hardin|I’ve left Princess Nyna someplace safe for now. We need to decide who will command here. I was hoping it would be you.|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Marth|Me? But, Sir Hardin, you are far more qualified-|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Hardin|Tsk, Princess Nyna would not be pleased to hear us nitpicking over who will be listed in the history books. Take command, so we can oust this Macedonian scum and be done with it.|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Marth|You are sure?|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Hardin|Make no mistake. Lord Marth. I consider myself an exceptionally good judge of character. If I thought you acted out of selfishness or ambition, I would not extend the offer I have. You have my trust.|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Marth|Lord Hardin, thank you. That is an honor. If you don’t mind me saying so… I feel as though I’ve made a good friend. We share the same ideals, I think.|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Hardin|That we do. May our friendship be a long one.|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Merach|Princess Minerva bade me guard this castle in her absence. You shall not take it so long as I stand!|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Merach|Heh… You think you’ve won, wretch? Far from it…|
FE11|05-ChampionsOfAurelis|Aurelis King|Prince Marth, your arrival could not have been better timed. Please accept our gratitude. Princess Nyna of Archanea is en route from the fortress. I am sure she will wish to meet you. The battle is not won yet, though: many of the enemy continue to hold out within the castle’s halls. Stay wary.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Julian|Hey, c’mon, Lena, shake a leg! We need to get out of the Teeth, and we need to do it yesterday! Rumor has it the knights of Altea are at the foot of the mountain. We won’t get a better chance. It’s just a little bit farther. Stick with me.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Lena|Julian, I’m sorry...but I left my Mend staff back there. It’s very precious to me...You go on ahead...Save yourself! Here, I could use this Warp staff to send you someplace safe--|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Julian|Uh-uh, honey. No can do. I didn’t betray my boys back there so you could zap me on out of here alone. Forget the staff; I’ll come back later and get it for you myself. All right? Right now though, I need you to RUN. Tick-tack, now move that frock!|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Navarre|.....|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Young Man|Take care around mercenaries. They’re quite skillful; if you’re unlucky, they may drop you at stroke.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Teenage Boy|Units with high skill deal more frequent critical hits. Units with high speed have an easier time avoiding enemy attack.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Old Woman|Hunters are stronger than archers, but they also have weaker defenses. Keep them out of close-range combat.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Old Man|Oh, ho ho! Don’t you look young and full of life! Such a warm smile here deserves a nice reward. Here, take this axe—this EVIL abomination of an axe! Beware! Its blade drinks blood and devours flesh. I’d hate to see you come to any harm!”|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Navarre|Will it be tears or blood you weep first?|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Navarre|Fools...|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Caeda|Navarre! Since when does a swordsman of your caliber fall in with thieves and cutthroats?|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Navarre|What? Who are you? Fly away, girl, before someone decides to swat you.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Caeda|Please, Navarre. Why fight for nothing when you can fight for something? Leave this rabble. Lend your sword to our cause. Or, if you will not, then turn it on me now instead.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Navarre|...Nay, I’ll turn no blade of mine on a women. If you’re willing to pay for my services with your life, then consider yourself the high bidder. My sword is yours.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Julian|Stop! Whoa! I’m...I’m not your enemy!|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Marth|Huh?|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Julian|I’m Julian! One of the bad guys! A Soothsire. Oh! Well, except I’m not anymore. See, now I’m a good guy! Lena gave me a reason to--well, let’s just say I’ve had a change of heart.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Marth|...|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Julian|Hm, not explainin’ myself very well, am I? OK OK, what I’m trying to say is--|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Marth|Yes. You can come with us.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Julian|Oh... Well... well, good.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Marth|I’m inclined to trust you. If you’ve truly had a change of heart, you deserve the chance to prove it. Show me you’re ready to help people, and then I’ll know I’ve picked a man of character.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Julian|Wow. That’s.... Thanks! I couldn’t ask for a better deal!|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Marth|Good day, Sister. Are you all right?|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Lena|Yes... Thank you.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Marth|These mountains are dangerous. My forces will draw the enemy away; use that time to escape.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Lena|No, I wish to help.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Marth|But... you... What?|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Lena|Please, sire. I am a cleric. I cannot bear to watch others come to harm when I have the power to help.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Marth|Well... all right... But I don’t wish to see you come to harm, either.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Lena|I will be careful. Thank you, sire.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Navarre|......|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Marth|Um, aren’t you--|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Navarre|Navarre.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Marth|The great swordsman they speak of... Will you fight with us, then?|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Navarre|You need only name your target.|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Reynard|Har. You must really want to die, comin’ into the Soothsires’ palace unbidden!|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Reynard|Arrgh... One day it’ll be you!|
FE11|03-ABrushInTheTeeth|Malledus|Sire! Would you look at this! Those rogues left 15,000 gold here when they fled! This money will buy plenty of new equipment for your army. Tomorrow is the day, sire, when we finally arrive in Aurelis. Be sure to rest up tonight.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|Nyna, we’ll soon be launching the attack. If you have something to tell me... now is the time to do it.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Nyna|All right, Marth. As you wish. When the Dolhr-Grust allied forces seized control of Archanea, the entire royal family was killed, save me. I was given into Grust’s custody- the custody of the Sable Order, to be more specific. I am told Dolhr wished for my execution- and with it the end of the holy lineage of House Archanea- and Grust was willing to comply.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|But you are not dead.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Nyna|That is right. I was not put to the sword. The Sable Order’s captain came to my defense. His name... was Camus.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|....!|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Nyna|Camus protected me, knowing he risked incurring the wrath of the Shadow Dragon. He was the one who eventually arranged for my escape to Aurelis.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|...I had no idea. That certainly explains Dolhr’s displeasure with him.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Nyna|I hated him, too, at first. But in time, I found my hatred tempered by the compassion he showed me, my feelings... changed. And now, all I wish is to see him again... But not if it means you and he must fight.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|Nyna... Do you... I cannot make any promises. But I will do what I can. I hope you can accept that.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Nyna|Thank you, Marth. I could not ask for more.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Old Man|Ah, Prince Marth! Welcome, welcome. Tell me, have you seen my granddaughter Lena? Is she well? If she happens to you, would you see she gets this Hammerne staff? It’s a staff of repairing passed down through our family. I’m certain she’ll make good use of it. Of course, not all items can be repaired; be sure to caution her about that.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|General Camus! Can you hear me? It is I, Marth of Altea! I must speak with you! Please, show yourself!|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Camus|Prince Marth. I am Camus of Grust.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|General, I have no wish to fight you. You know this battle is pointless; surely you must!|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Camus|So long as Grust continues to support Dolhr’s ambitions, it does not matter what I know or think. I am a knight; I have a duty to fight for my motherland’s glory till the very end.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|But surely-|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Camus|Prince Marth, there is nothing you can do or say. I am party to your father’s murder. Are you a man or not? Draw your sword.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Nyna|Stop! Camus!|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Camus|Princess Nyna...|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|Nyna, what are you doing here?! This is the middle of the battlefield!|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Nyna|I know, I know... But please, Camus, listen to me... Camus, you gave me back my life. And Marth, he gave me back my kingdom. I do not wish to see that the two of you fight. It is... it is unbearable. Please, Camus, fight with us. We need your strength. ...I need it.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Camus|I am sorry, Princess.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Nyna|What? But, Camus!|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Camus|Were my heart my master, I would do exactly as you say. But what sort of knight abandons his kingdom- his king!- now, when they need him the most? Would you have me toss away the life I have built as if it meant nothing at all?|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Nyna|No, Camus, I... I don’t know...|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Camus|I have lived as a knight, and I intend to die as one. There are no other roads left for me to walk. Farewell, my princess. I shall never forget our days together at the palace, few though they were. I pray you meet someone who can bring joy back into your life.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Lorenz|No victory here can give Grust back her glory.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Lorenz|This, too, must be fate.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Caeda|General Lorenz! My name is Caeda. I hail from Talys. My father has told me quite a bit about you.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Lorenz|Princess Caeda! My, look what a lovely young woman you’ve grown into. Your father was a good friend to me, many years ago.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Caeda|General, I heard you opposed Grust forming an alliance with Dolhr. Why didn’t you try to stop it?|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Lorenz|You think I did not try, Princess? Our king is meek; in the end, Dolhr proved better at cowing him than I did.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Caeda|But sir, surely you know that Dolhr intends to use Manaketes to conquer humankind! You must act now- for Grust’s sake, if not the world’s! Join us, General Lorenz. We can put an end to this battle right now.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Lorenz|Hmm...What you say makes sense enough, but I serve Grust. I cannot simply betray my country.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Caeda|Ah, but what makes a country?|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Lorenz|Pardon?|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Caeda|Is it one man- your king? Or is it the countless innocent people who make their home here?|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Lorenz|Well, that’s- Hmm...|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Caeda|My father has a saying: “A kingless country is a country still; but a king without subjects rules naught but hills.” If you disobey your king to ensure his subjects’ safety, how is that a betrayal? You are protecting his reign.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Lorenz|Protecting his reign? ...Aha ha ha, ha ha! Ahh, that mad logic! I feel as though I’ve shed twenty years and I’m talking to your father again. You win, Princess. I yield! I will join you, in the interests of king and country. Har!|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|General Lorenz, hold!|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Lorenz|What? You are Marth, the Altean prince...|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|Yes, sir. The king of Talys told me much about you. He said you opposed Grust forming an alliance with Dolhr, right from the very start.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Lorenz|That’s right.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|Then fight with us! With your help, we can defeat Dolhr!|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Lorenz|Forgive me, Prince Marth, but am I to just abandon my country, then?|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|...|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Lorenz|I know yours is the just cause. Still, I wish to remain a Grustian general, right to the end. I am fighting here because that is the way for me to honor my kingdom.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|Forgive me, General, but... is it, really?|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Lorenz|Pardon?|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|Since you are a Grustian General, then surely you fight for Grust’s future first and foremost. But tell me…from where you are standing now, do you see any future for your country?|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Lorenz|...I shall have to learn to mask my misgivings better, if you can pluck them from my heart so easily. You are quite correct. If I care what becomes of Grust, then I cannot continue to stand by Dolhr. So, I will stand by you instead, Prince- and hope the future is a bit easier to spot from there.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Lorenz|Prince Marth? I am General Lorenz of Grust. I have decided to join you, in the interest of my fellow Grustians.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|I am honored, General. Thank you. Caeda tells me you and her father were close.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Lorenz|Yes. How the princess has grown, though! Sharp as a tack, that one. Such a change from when she was- Now what am I saying? Caeda has always been clever. Even as a wee girl she knew how to wrap her elders about her little finger.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|You knew Caeda when she was little?|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Lorenz|Oh, yes. The mischief she got into! Well, those are stories for another day. First, we’ve a battle to finish!|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|So we do, sir!|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Camus|With this lance, Gradivus, I am all but invincible. A pity you had to waste your life.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Camus|Nyna... Fare... Well...|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|Forgive me, Nyna. I was unable to reunite you with your general.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Nyna|No, Marth, I... I should not have made such a selfish request. I am sorry, so terribly sorry...|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|....|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Nyna|The worst part, Marth... the worst part is, I knew it would come to this. Ever since I gave you the emblem, I just knew... Have you heard the story of Artemis’s Curse?|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|No...|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Nyna|The last time the Fire Emblem changed hands to save House Archanea, it was not without cost. There was a princess named Artemis who loved your ancestor, Anri, with all her heart. He loved her as well- but when Medeus appeared, the two were parted forever. She cursed the Fire Emblem- called it the end of war, but also the end of love. Now the emblem has changed hands again, and I am the one who is cursed...|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|Nyna...|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Nyna|Look at me, so quick to fall apart... You lost loved ones in Altea and took it so bravely; but I cannot be so brave... Please... leave me for a moment. This is too much to bear. I need to... to confront my feelings...|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|...Say no more, Nyna... Princess. I will step out. Send for me if you need anything.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Nyna|Thank you, Marth...|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Nyna|Ahh...! Camus, Camus... Ahh... no... Oh, why...|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Marth|Nyna- Princess.|
FE11|20-CamusTheSable|Nyna|I am told Camus has not been found. Perhaps he still lives. I know how selfish it is to wish it... But if he cannot be with me, then I must cling to the hope his life has not been cut short. It is all I have left.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Nyna|Grust's artillery...Our opponent is mighty.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Marth|Nonetheless we must face them head-on; they stand between us and Altea.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Nyna|That hunger for danger worries me, Marth. Humanity's hopes rest on your shoulders. I would sooner not see them crushed.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Marth|Which? Humanity's hopes, or my shoulders? ...Have a little faith, Nyna. The enemy ballisticians can strike from afar, but they're powerless up close. All we need to do is move in and silence them before they do too much damage. Watch!|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Young Man|Ballisticians are really only vulnerable to one type of weapon: the thunderbolt. Fresh out of thunderbolts? Then you'll just have to dart in and hit ‘em at close range.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Young Woman|We and our countrymen wanted to fight for Archanea, you know. Not just us, neither. They say some of Grust's soldiers would sooner rally under Archanea's banner than Dolhr's. But General Camus conquered us ‘fore we could act, and Grust has had us under their thumb ever since. Here's hopin' you win this battle quick. We like bein' free, don't you know.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Beck|Prince Marth, I presume? The name's Beck. I fought in the battle at Castle Deil. After my shameful defeat there, see, I took refuge in this village. And when I heard your army was marchin' this way, I readied my ballista, hopin' for another taste of battle. So how 'bout it, princey? Take me along! I'm packin' thunderbolts, see? The enemy ballisticians'll never know what hit 'em!|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Midia|Hello, my lover.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Astram|Midia...? Midia, my sweet! Can it really be you? I feared you were dead.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Midia|Oh, Astram! How could you not have heard? Archanea is free! The Altean army came, and liberated the palace along with all the hostages within! Now we fight as one. Come with us, Astram! You needn't dance to Dolhr's fiddle any longer.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Astram|I've a mind to break their fiddle, for all the evils they have wrought.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Midia|Now you can. We can take them together.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Astram|That we can. ...Midia. I am sorry I left you alone. I will not make that mistake again.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Midia|No, you certainly won't. Now that I have you back...you'll find me exceedingly reluctant to let you go.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Astram|Ooh... Yes, I can see that! Just take care you don't crush me instead of Dolhr!|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Astram|You are Prince Marth?|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Marth|Correct, Sir Astram.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Astram|...Forgive my lack of courtesy, but you and I need to be clear on a certain point.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Marth|Oh?|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Astram|While I have decided to lend you my sword, my allegiance lies with Princess Nyna-not you, my lord. I will follow your orders, but should I learn you have been false to her, or that you are manipulating her... Heads will roll.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Marth|Well, Sir Astram...in the interest of keeping my head atop my shoulders, let me suggest this: Fight with me. Watch me, and then judge for yourself whether I am worthy of your skill and of your help.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Astram|...... Hmm, very well. Your orders, then, Lord Marth.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Grigas|Hmph! Care to see what steel the Wooden Cavalry is really made of?|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Grigas|Nngh... So, the prince can fight... But... your victories are numbered... General Camus and his Sable Order will be upon you rabble very... soon... and you will die... on the lance... of the greatest warrior... alive...|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Nyna|Spectacularly done, Marth. ...Does something ail you? I thought you would be happier.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Marth|Today, there was this commoner... She mentioned Grust was divided about the war. Some of its people wanted to fight with Altea, she said...Ever since I lost my father and kingdom, I've held nothing but hate in my heart for Gra and Grust...but not once did I give any thought to what must have been going on in their heads.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Nyna|And now you find your hate for them has been lessened?|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Marth|No... the hate remains. I will never forget the pain they inflicted upon me, the rage I felt. Yet now, at least, I can tell you it's not just hate...Not anymore.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Nyna|Not all evils are wrought of evil purposes. Perhaps this sounds naive, but...A true leader needs to look at his opponent and see more than just an enemy.|
FE11|13-TheWoodenCavalry|Marth|....|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Marth|Cain, how are your wounds? You should rest.|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Cain|These scratches? It's my pride you're wounding sire. ...Anyway, we must talk. There's a reason I've returned. ...Sire, I am...I am to deliver to you His Majesty's last words.|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Marth|Last words? You don't mean...Father...|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Cain|My condolences, sire. The king died valiantly on the fields of Gra. The traitors took from him the divine blade Falchion and gave no quarter to those of our soldiers who remained...|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Marth|I...I see...So they're all dead. Father, too...|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Cain|His last words were as follows: Tell my son that I leave the future of Altea and our continent in his hands. He must rise now where I have fallen. As Falchion's rightful heir, he has been born into greatness... Now...he must be great.|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Marth|...Father. I will try...|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Cain|...Sire, I...I cannot bear this! Failing to protect His Majesty...then leaving my brothers to die, slinking away like some coward...This indignity is too much to bear! One day I will repay them in kind. I will avenge the fallen...I swear it!|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Marth|Cain, you speak for us both. When that day comes, we will punish them together: Gra, Dolhr...all of them!|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Jagen|Sire! We ought to pay a visit to these homes outside the castle.|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Jagen|Your countrymen love you; perhaps they have knowledge that may serve us.|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Old Man|Just ‘cause you see an enemy over yonder doesn't mean you should go runnin' up to him like a fool! Lure one out, then take ‘im down! Then go out and lure the next. That’s how we did it when I was a lad!|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Young Man|Sir Jagen is a paladin: the champion of Altea! I’ve never met him, but I hear he’s strong as an ox despite his age. Still, you can’t have a champion like him do everything; that’s not fair to all your would-be future champions! Let our other units fight and gain experience, or you may find yourself in a real fix down the line.|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Old Woman|If you get hurt, rest a spell at a fort. A short stay there, and you’ll be feeling hale as ever.|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Young Man|Javelins and Hand Axes are versatile weapons that let you attack both up close and from a short distance away.|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Old Man|Weapons aren’t indestructible, you know! When a weapon’s durability reaches 0, that’s it: no more weapon. So be sure to keep an eye on those numbers.|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Jagen|Look sire. Not all of Gra's might harries the castle. They've left soldiers here outside.|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Marth|Elice will have no plans to escape... Let's seize that fort across the water. Perhaps we can squash enemy reinforcement at the source.|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Marth|Mages...That will complicate things. They don't need to get as close to do us harm. We'll need to approach carefully.|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Marth|There. That ought to do for the enemy soldiers around here. Malledus! Why arent you with my sister? Did you leave her someplace safe?|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Malledus|...Princess Elice will not be joining us. She has elected to stay at the castle.|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Malledus|Hold, sire! Where are you going?|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Marth|Where do you think!|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Malledus|Stop! Sire, consider for a moment why the princess would go as far as to lie to you to ensure your escape. Your sister knows that you are the future of Altea- nay, the whole land!|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Marth|.....!|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Marth|I'm...our future...|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Malledus|Sire... You must live. Drink deeply now of these injustices; sup on these slights they serve. Remember them! One day you will lead us back here to avenge the fallen and reclaim Altea in their names!|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Marth|...Then it seems my life is no longer mine to hazard.|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Malledus|In your veins flows the blood of a hero- the blood of Anri. You are a son of House Archanea, and sole heir to Falchion- our only hope of defeating Medeus, Emperor of Dolhr. Sire, were't in my power, I would have you choose you own path...but I'm afraid your path has chosen you.|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Marth|......|
FE11|00-Prologue3|Cain|His last words were as follows: Tell my son that I leave the future of Altea and our continent in his hands. He must rise now where I have fallen. As Falchion's rightful heir, he has been born into greatness... Now...he must be great.|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Frey|Sire!|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Marth|...Frey! Abel! You're alive!|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Abel|Yes, sire. Princess Elice bade us protect you. Sir Malledus stayed behind to accompany her.|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Frey|Sire, we must be quick. Sir Jagen awaits us at the gates.|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Abel|Blast! This will not do. How did Gra's soldiers ever make it this far?|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Marth|Jagen and the others will be caught like mice...We need to seize the gates and secure the area, immediately.|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Enemy Soldier|Now who's that who thinks they can sneak up on us? Ho ho... What's this? I spy the Altean prince. Oi, listen up, you lot! Bag the prince! Dead or alive, he'll fetch us as sweet a reward as the mind can conjure.|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Marth|Hmm, they have archers... We need to take care they don't pick us off from afar.|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Jagen|Sire, it gladdens me to see you in one piece. It's not safe for you here; we must be away at once!|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Cain|Prince Marth! Where are you? Answer me, sire!|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Marth|Cain? ...That's Cain!|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Marth|Cain, you're supposed to be in Gra! Why have you returned without- Yow! Those wounds...!|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Cain|Sire, it's really you...I feared the worst. That his message would go undeliv...Agh...|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Marth|In that state, I don't know how you even stayed ahorse. Those gashes must be treated at once-|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Jagen|No, sire. Not until we've escaped.|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Marth|...Cain, I trust you can put off bleeding to death for just a while longer?|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Cain|Of course, sir... I aim to please...|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Malledus|Princess Elice! The enemy is nearly upon us! Gather your things, quickly!|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Elice|No, Malledus. I am staying here.|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Malledus|S-staying here?! What madness is this?|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Elice|Too many people have died to keep Altea and its castle safe. I cannot abandon what so many lives have brought. With Father and Mother unaccounted for, I am the natural choice to remain with Altea's people. And besides, by staying, I can buy time for the rest of you to escape.|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Malledus|Nonsense. Just gather your things, and-|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Elice|Malledus. I am not suggesting. I am commanding. If something befalls Father, Marth will become the last person in the entire world worthy of wielding the Falchion. I want you to guide him, Malledus- even when the rest of us no longer can.|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Malledus|Princess...I will try my best.|
FE11|00-Prologue2|Elice|There's not much time. Go, Malledus. ...Go!|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Malledus|There, sire. Up on the mountains to the south, you can see Dolhr Keep.|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Marth|And inside is Medeus, king of the earth dragons- the one they call the Shadow Dragon. ...Why doesn’t he leave the keep and face us?|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Malledus|I recall Lord Gotoh saying his return is not yet complete; only within the keep’s walls can he maintain dragon form.|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Marth|Really...? Then we have the advantage...|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Marth|To Dolhr Keep, then! Let us put a stop to this war!|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Old Man|Nestled in the mountains far to the southeast is a holy temple known as the Resurrectory. Use the staff of Aum there, and they say you can call a departed friend back from beyond the river of death.|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Merric|Princess Elice! You're safe!|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Elice|Oh, my! Merric, is that you? I haven't seen you in ages... So you've been fighting with the League? Thank you for keeping Marth safe.|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Merric|Well, I did learn a spell or two in Khadein. Here, Princess. Get behind me. I'll face the enemy for us both.|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Elice|You'll... face the...? Aha ha, oh, Merric!|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Merric|Wh..what's so funny, Princess? I was quite serious, I'll have you know!|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Elice|Ha ha, forgive me, Merric. It's just, I remembered you when you were little... You were always a bit delicate. Oftentimes I had to nurse you back to health. Remember?|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Merric|But that was– I couldn't– Yes.|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Elice|And look at you now. Such a brave, strong man! A far cry from the old Merric. But you don't have to pretend. I know you're far too sweet to mow down hordes of enemies. And... I think I prefer it that way.|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Merric|You... you do?|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Xemcel|This land, all of it- it belonged to us! Then you humans took it...defiled it!|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Xemcel|Rrgh... Emperor... Medeus... Forgive your servant's weakness...|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Enemy Soldier|Emperor! The enemy has broken through the gates!|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Medeus|That impudent boy... Have the guards take their positions. The keep must be defended.|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Enemy Soldier|At once!|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Medeus|Hmph, you’ll find an earth dragon like me harder to tame than Gharnef, brat. Come and face me. I’ll tear the ground asunder and send you straight down to hell!|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|????|Marth... Can you hear me?|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Marth|Lord Gotoh?|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Gotoh|I know you mean to challenge Medeus. But you and your companions haven’t the power to win.|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Marth|What? Why not? Because I failed to retrieve Falchion?|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Gotoh|You also failed to save the divine-dragon girl.|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Marth|I... did not mean for anything to happen to her-|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Gotoh|You can put your heart at ease. Tiki is not dead. She has merely returned to her slumber. Still, without her powers... We must take other steps. ...Select a handful of your best warriors. I must send you into an unseen dimension.|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Marth|An... unseen dimension, my lord?|
FE11|24-TheDragonkinRealm|Gotoh|A place outside the confines of our world. There you will find a tower; and once in the tower, you must pass its Keepers’ test. If your strength and your need are great enough, the tower’s master will answer... and then, perhaps, your fortunes will be changed for the better.|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Enemy Soldier|King Jiol, they're ‘ere! The League is outside the Bastion!|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Jiol|League? How dare you call them that! I see naught but a prince of ghosts and his pack of rebels.|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Enemy Soldier|B-beggin' your pardon, sire, but everybody calls 'em the League now. Altea and Aurelis and Archanea...The League of A's, you might say!|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Jiol|Shut up, you idiot! Hmmm...So the princeling has returned. And he leads all the might of Archanea, with the Fire Emblem in hand...Did you send to Dolhr for reinforcements like I asked?|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Enemy Soldier|Of course, sire. Macedon's pegasus knights are on their way.|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Jiol|Pegasus knights?! How am I supposed to stop the Lea- those REBELS with a handful of...of winged ponies! Send another messenger! Tell them we need Camus's Sable Order, or...or Michalis's Dragoons! Blast...I deserve the same protection as the rest of the Empire! Betraying Altean was Gharnef's idea! Let...let him fight the brat! Don't just stand there, DO something! I don't want to die!|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Young Man|At level 10, some units can change class- move up in the world, you might say! Cavaliers become paladins, mercenaries become ‘eroes, and, err- well, I forget the rest.|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Young Man|With a silver card, you can buy from shops at ‘alf price! Sounds like somethin' out of a dream, eh?|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|???|You must be Prince Marth of Altea. I have a favor to ask of you. This magic tome belongs to Bishop Boah of Archanea. General Volzhin of Dolhr has been keeping it stashed away, but it...found its way into my hands, you might say. I would appreciate greatly if you could return it to the good bishop in my stead. One other thing... Please take care of Princess Nyna. I am counting on you to keep her safe. ...I must go now. But our paths will cross again; you can be certain of that.|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Palla|Greetings, Prince Marth. I am Palla, of the Whitewinged Order of Macedon. My younger sister and I parted ways with Macedon the moment we heard Princess Maria was free. Until now, we had fought for Dolhr against our will- but no longer. You have freed us to do what our hearts tell us is right. I wish to fight with my mistress, Princess Minerva. My lance is hers, and yours. Still, sire, I fear for my youngest sister, Est. She flew to Grust some time ago and has yet to return. If the three of us- Catria, Est, and I- are reunited, we can serve you all the better. I hope Est is safe.|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Catria|Hail, Prince Marth! ‘Tis me, Catria. We meet again. My elder sister and I heard our mistress, Princess Minerva, had joined your ranks, so we absconded from Macedon to come and look for you here. I will fight my hardest for you, sire. You need only give the command.|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Jiol|Grrr... Altean rabble! I should have killed you stragglers back when I had the chance!|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Jiol|Thus falls... the mighty kingdom... of Gra...|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Nyna|Well done, Marth. Altea is just a step away. Now you can take back your home.|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Marth|Yes, and take it back I shall, but...|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Nyna|Something is wrong. What troubles you?|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Marth|Falchion isn't here.|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Nyna|The divine blade? Was it supposed to be?|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Marth|Yes. When one of my knights returned from the battle where my father, Cornelius, fell....he said Gra had stolen Falchion. And if we are to defeat Dolhr and the Shadow Dragon, Medeus...we need that blade.|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Malledus|Prince Marth!|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Marth|Did you find it, Malledus?|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Malledus|No...it seems Gharnef made off with it.|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Nyna|Gharnef? Then, to find Falchion-|
FE11|14-LandOfSorrow|Marth|That's right. We'll need to go to Khadein, the kingdom of magic, where he resides. It pains me to turn astray when Altea is so close, but it must be done.|
FE11|10-PrincessMinerva|Zharov|Princess Minerva, what brings you here? You've left your post: not very wise. Might I remind you, poor conduct on your part could have repercussions on how...comfortable...your sister remains.|
FE11|10-PrincessMinerva|Minerva|I am aware of my sister, thank you. ...I did not come to make trouble. Just let me see Maria, for a little while. She's only a child, General. Think of what she must be going through.|
FE11|10-PrincessMinerva|Zharov|Impossible, I'm afraid. She is a hostage. If your sister's well-being concerns you, then start following orders.|
FE11|10-PrincessMinerva|Enemy Soldier|General! Grave news! The rebel army has been sighted east of Castle Deil!|
FE11|10-PrincessMinerva|Zharov|What?! Why in creation would the rebels come here? Blast...Order the Dragoons to sortie! And don't forget to send word to the main army. We need reinforcements!|
FE11|10-PrincessMinerva|Minerva|Rebels...? Then Marth has arrived...|
FE11|10-PrincessMinerva|Middle-Aged Man|You know, once, there were three great magi in our world: Miloah, the Master of Aura; Gharnef, the Dark Pontifex; and Gotoh, the White Sage. But now Miloah is gone... If only there were somebody left powerful enough to stop Gharnef...|
FE11|10-PrincessMinerva|Young Man|That Medonian princess, Minerva... She doesn’t seem like a bad sort. I have a sister, too, and if somebody threatened to hurt her... Well, I’m just sayin' you can’t always judge people based on their actions.",negative

Maria's plight forced me to treat you as an enemy when I knew you were not; suffice to say, I am deeply sorry for that. ...The whole world has gone mad. Most of Macedon fights for Dolhr now. My own brother Michalis leads them. And on their hands is the blood of their king, my father. They must be stopped; I must stop them. Still, I fear for my soldiers whom I can no longer protect, especially the three Whitewing sisters: Palla, Catria, and Est. Dolhr worried we would rebel, and forced us to separate.
