FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Rhea,Ugh…,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Cyril,"Hang in there, Lady Rhea",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,She needs help! Hurry!,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Manuela,"That's a serious injury… It's a miracle that she's even alive right now. I'll do what I can, but…",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,"Five years ago, when this place fell an enormous white creature appeared on the battlefield. It was the Immaculate One... Rhea.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,She tried to save me…,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,What? You already knew Rhea's true identity?,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,"Thinking back, I suppose so.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,"I see. In the past the children of the goddess were all able to change their appearance, just like the Immaculate One. I lost that power long ago, but it seems Rhea has not.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,You're one of the children of the goddess?,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,"Is it not obvious? Flayn and I both are. We have protected Garreg Mach, and all of Fódlan, for a very long time. But now... the light of Rhea's life is on the verge of disappearing from this world. It is flickering... I do not know if she can be saved. Even if she is, I wonder if she will remain unchanged...",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Flayn,Professor. Are you able to carry on Rhea's work. As the protector of Fódlan and as leader of the people who live here... You must defend the people. Guide them and teach them. Join their hearts and spread peace across the whole of the land.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,It is not as though you must become the archbishop. But Fódlan needs leadership it is up to you to govern this war-torn land.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,I...,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,You need not reply right this moment. We will strive to heal Rhea as best we can.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Flayn,Perhaps it would help to seek counsel from our friends at the monastery about this matter.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,"I agree. When your mind is made up, please speak with me. I would ask that you give me your decision in the presence of Rhea herself.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Ferdinand,"Well done, Professor. We have brought the war to a magnificent conclusion. The Empire, Alliance, and Kingdom are no more. Nor are there any factions that could blindside us and cause conflict. Now it falls to us to rule Fódlan, and bring about an era of peace and prosperity. You would be a fine choice for the first ruler of this new era. I sincerely believe that.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,Thank you.,positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Ferdinand,"So, your heart is already set on it! Excellent! In that case, congratulations are in order.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,I'm not sure.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Ferdinand,"Well, if you are unsure, what does that say about everybody else's chances?",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Ferdinand,"I will follow you, Professor. I aim to be a great and respectable noble.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Linhardt,"Congratulations on a job well done, Professor. I do hope Lady Rhea is well? Is it true what I heard? You will be taking over her post? Would that make you archbishop? Or higher still? Am I in the company of the future ruler of Fódlan?",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,Either would be a hassle.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Linhardt,"I agree! Imagine all that responsibility. Until now, you've always fought with all of us by your side. Bring ruler would be a much lonelier job, though I am certain you would excel.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,The latter. I will rule over Fódlan.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Linhardt,So you've already decided... Such proactive thinking is the hallmark of a good ruler.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Linhardt,Me? I have no interest in a leadership role. I'm happy to spend the rest of my days studying...and napping.,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Caspar,"All... RIGHT! We did it, Professor! We really gave it to 'em out there! With all the fighting and hardships, I don't know how we did it... But I'm glad we made it through together!",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,Me too.,positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Caspar,Now all we gotta do is make you the new ruler! That's gonna be a fun coronation!,positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,It was a lot to push through.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Caspar,"Sorry if I made your life more difficult! None of that matters anymore though, right? Now all we gotta do is make you the new ruler! That's gonna be a fun coronation!",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Bernadetta,"Phew... It's all over, Professor. Though I am worried about Lady Rhea... But still, Fódlan is united, and those terrible people lurking in the dark have finally been destroyed. Looks like it's the dawn of a wonderful new era...of blissful seclusion for Bernie!",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,That won't do.,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Bernadetta,"Wh-what? Why not?! Hey, that better not be your first official decree! You're going to ask for my help again, aren't you? Oh, why?",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,Suit yourself.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Bernadetta,"Woo-hoo! You finally did it, Bernie! Now take your reward of eternal peace and quiet!",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Dorothea,"Finally! An end to the fighting. Have you ever felt happier? I've worried that I might not live to see this day, but here we are, and everything is going to be OK, isn't it? Huh, my heart feels like it's ready to burst. I'm so full of happiness, yet I feel a sense of loss too...",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,We did lose a lot.,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Dorothea,"Yes, we certainly did. But we managed to keep a great many things safe, as well.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,We protected more than we lost.,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Dorothea,I agree. I suppose if I think of those who are gone as the people who ensured our freedom...it hurts less.,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Dorothea,"Please do what you can to keep the peace, so we never have to face such awful times again.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Petra,"War has been ended. I will now be returning to Brigid. I hope in the new Fódlan, Brigid can be accepted with friendship. When my professor becomes the leader, I think that will have a possibility. Please, choose well.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,Same to you.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Petra,Yes. Now I must be packing.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,I'm not sure yet...,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Petra,Is that the truth? I will be waiting for your decision. I will be packing while you are thinking.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Felix,It's over. What will you do? I heard you intend to lead.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,I'm not sure.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Felix,You shouldn't need that long to decide. Make up your mind.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,I'm more interested in what you'll do.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Felix,"Well, if you do choose to lead, I might like to work for you. But first, I'll go back to the old Faerghus territory. Where my father and my old friends once lived. I need to pay respects, put flowers on their graves.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Ashe,"Well, it took a long while for us to get here, but we did it. The war is finally over. We've been through a lot together, haven't we? Let me just say, it's truly been an honor.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,The same to you.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Ashe,I'm flattered to hear you say do.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,"Oh, cut it out.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Ashe,"Hey, come on, I mean it! There's nothing to be embarrassed about!",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Ashe,"For whatever it's worth, I think you'd make a great monarch, and I'd support you every step of the way.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Sylvain,"Ah, yow! She didn't have to slap me that hard. Oh, Professor, it's you. What's up? Need something?",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,Lover's quarrel again?,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Sylvain,"I dunno if I'd call us lovers, exactly. Not yet anyway. It's was just a dinner invite.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,"Don't need anything, but...",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Sylvain,"Heh, you worried I might cause trouble again? Nah, I just invited a girl out to dinner.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Sylvain,"All fighting and no loving makes Sylvain a rusty boy. Well, I can get back in practice now. Peacetime is the best for love--nobody dying, nobody getting hurt...except me, apparently. If you're gonna be the ruler, you need to keep the peace going so I can catch up on my love life.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Mercedes,I heard a rumor that you're going to take over for Lady Rhea!,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,It hasn't been decided.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Mercedes,"Oh, so the rumor was really true? I hope you accept. I don't think there's anyone else who could do it.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,That's the plan.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Mercedes,"So it's already been decided? That's very admirable of you, Professor.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Mercedes,You have nothing to worry about. We're here to help you if you need anything at all! We'll support you no matter what path you choose to follow!,positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Annette,"Is Lady Rhea OK? She was quite weakened to start, and then she took all those heavy injuries... I don't want to imagine it, but what will happen if Lady Rhea passes away like this?",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,We'll cross that bridge if we come to it.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Annette,I suppose you're right.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,I'm sure she'll be fine.,positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Annette,Yes. I'm praying every day that she'll get well as soon as possible.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Annette,"Anyhow... You're going to be the ruler, Professor? It's so strange to think of, for some reason!",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Ingrid,"Can it really be? Are we truly at peace? To think that my days will not be spent debating war tactics and preparing for battles. It doesn't quite feel real. Now that we are finally at peace, I'm not quite sure what to do with myself.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,Just take it easy.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Ingrid,That sounds...challenging for how easy it must actually be.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,Maybe you should think about the future now.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Ingrid,Thinking of the future has never been my forte.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Ingrid,"As long as I have a routine in place for myself, I can find contentment.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Lorenz,"The day is ours, Professor. And this victory will ensure our names are immortalized in history. Or perhaps this is but the opening chapter in the tale they will write of our glory. After all, if you are to rule this reunited land, surely there is bound to be a place for me at your side?",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,Absolutely.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Lorenz,"I read your mind, didn't I? Fear not! I will not fail to rise to the occasion!",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,Nothing's decided yet.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Lorenz,Is that so? It seems to me that everyone has already assumed you would take the position.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Lorenz,"Regardless, your decision will have an impact on my future, so be sure to make it a good one!",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Raphael,"Hey, Professor! I was just thinking I might go train. I know the war's over, but that doesn't mean I can stop working my muscles!",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,That makes sense.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Raphael,I'm glad you see it my way! I always knew you were a smart one!,positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,You should work on other things too.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Raphael,"Really? I wouldn't know where to start, but...",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Raphael,There's no harm in keeping up with my training!,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Ignatz,"After all that's happened to Lady Rhea, all of the stuff with Solon and the others, and everything that's happened with you, Professor... There's still a lot I don't understand. Please teach me, Professor--everything you know, everything you've learned.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,OK.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Ignatz,"Thank you, oh thank you!",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,If I get the chance...,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Ignatz,"If it's at all possible, I hope you'll speak about it not just to me, but to everyone else as well. I think everyone should know what happened here. If we're going to build a new, united Fódlan...that's absolutely crucial.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Lysithea,"Those who slither in the dark will never harm anyone again. They're finally done for. Thank you, Professor. Finally, I feel some vindication for what I've gone through.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,"No, thank you, Lysithea.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Lysithea,"Ah, Professor. Ever the modest one. I do like that aspect of you.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,Keep up the good work.,positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Lysithea,"Uh, sure thing.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Lysithea,"As long as I'm of use here, I'm happy to stick around, Professor.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Marianne,"And with that, we can finally enjoy a time of peace. I'm honored to have fought by your side. Even if you haven't made plans yet, I know you'll do your best, whatever your future may hold.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,You've grown much stronger.,positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Marianne,"If true, that's all thanks to you and our allies.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,You've become quite the optimist.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Marianne,I never would've dreamed my heart could have grown this way.,positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Marianne,Please let me know if there's anything more I can do.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Hilda,"Hey, Professor! The war is finally, really, definitely over now, right? We're not gonna find out there was some evil shadowy figure hiding behind the subterranean guys, are we?",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,Who knows.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Hilda,"Well, whatever. No matter what comes, I know we can triumph in the end!",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,I don't think so.,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Hilda,"Ah, that's good! Though to be honest, there's not much that would surprise me at this point...",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Hilda,"I feel invincible! A nice perk of being your student, don't you think?",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Leonie,"Well, we both made it. And we avenged Jeralt too. Can't say it gets any better than that. You've got a lot of work ahead of you, I hear. People want you to govern, don't they?",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,It's a hassle.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Leonie,"Yeah. Sadly, this isn't the kind of burden I can take off your hands.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,It's a dilemma.,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Leonie,"Well, at the end of the day, it's your decision. Just take your time. Think it through.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Leonie,"You've got to consider it carefully, so you don't have any regrets. Whatever you choose, though, just know that I'm here for you.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Alois,"We did it, Captain!",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Leonie,Make sure you've got no regrets.,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Alois,"At last, the day is upon us. The captain would be pleased. Don't you think, Leonie?",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Leonie,Definitely. And he'd be proud of the professor too.,positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Alois,"It seems like our efforts have been rewarded. It was certainly a long, difficult struggle to get here.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Leonie,"It was. Oh, Jeralt... We worked so hard for this.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,"Uh, hello?",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Alois,Whaaaaaah!,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Leonie,Aaah! How long have you been standing there?!,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Alois,"Er, ahem. Whether or not you choose to succeed Lady Rhea, we will forever be by your side.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Leonie,Yeah. We'll be here no matter what you decide. But make sure you think it through. You don't want to have any regrets.,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,Well? Is your mind made up?,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,No.,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,I understand. Just know that we are applying all our power right now toward healing Rhea. You should take this opportunity to speak with everyone. I am certain it will do you good.,positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,Yes,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Flayn,"I have faith in Lady Rhea's convalescence, but even so, what she needs now is rest. And while she is recovering, somebody must watch over Fódlan. There is no one more fit to wear such a mantle than you, Professor. That is what I believe. I do not doubt the others feel the same.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Hanneman,"Shambhala... An underground city with an entirely different lineage than the goddess? Strange phenomena, driven by a source totally alien to the Crests that we understand. Most unsettling! Could it be magic? Some manner of technology? I would like to know the truth of it all. Very much so. I want to know their history, their knowledge. Why do you suppose they chose this place to occupy?",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,"Well, I don't know.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Hanneman,"No, I suppose you wouldn't... It seems we will have to excavate Shambhala to know more. Although, I heard you will be the Ruler here? Should I ask your permission to proceed with the dig?",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Manuela,"Life can be tough, you know? But if you've got your friends to help you through, it can be a lot easier. Maybe you butt heads sometimes...but that's OK. That's how you build bonds, right? And I've got friends, Professor. Plenty of those. It's true love that seems to have passed me by.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,You should relax.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Manuela,Relax? I'm relaxed.,positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,There's still hope.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Manuela,But where is my true love to be found? Where is my ray of hope?,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,Time to give up?,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Manuela,Yeah… I'm starting to figure that's the most realistic option.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Manuela,"At this point, I'm just hoping you stay single too. Then at least we can share each other's misery!",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Alois,"Jeralt... We've done it. We've finally brought this creaky old ship ashore. The fight was long and bitter, but finally...I can lay down my burden.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,"Uh, hello?",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Alois,"Whaaaaah! It's you! Don't creep up like a ghost. Next time, announce yourself. Er, ahem. Whether or not you choose to succeed Lady Rhea, I will forever be by your side. You should live your life however you want. That's what the captain would say, I think.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Catherine,"Lady Rhea stopped the forces that threatened to destroy Fódlan. She's trying to realize her own dream of peace. Isn't that enough? Can't you let her rest? If you're the only person who's fit to replace her, you should just do it. I'm sure Lady Rhea wishes for that too, right? I can't think of anyone who's more well suited to the job.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Shamir,"The war's finally over... I have to admit, even I got a little emotional. Rhea's condition doesn't look good. There's nothing to do now but wait. More importantly, are you serious about becoming Fódlan's new ruler?",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,I'm not sure.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Shamir,"It's pretty sudden. Either way, do what you think is best.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,I am.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Shamir,"You made up your mind pretty quickly. Either way, do what you think is best.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Cyril,"Professor, do you figure Lady Rhea will be OK? She will, won't she? I don't care one bit who'll succeed Lady Rhea, 'cause nobody's gonna need to. She's gonna be happy and healthy again. You'll see.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Anna,I can tell that things will settle down soon enough. Gotta get back to slinging wares and making moolah! And hopefully no more messes to spoil it after this...,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Gatekeeper,"Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Say, how is the archbishop faring? The soldiers and citizens are all concerned! Just when we thought peace had finally arrived... What's to become of Fódlan?",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Rhea,"Sweet child... You have finally come... I am so happy. It does my heart well to see you here, safe and sound.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,"Have you made your decision, professor? Thankfully, Rhea has survived her trying ordeal. However... There is no telling how much longer her light will continue to shine.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Flayn,"Professor, have you decided? Will you become the next ruler of Fódlan?",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,...,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Rhea,"Before I hear your answer, I shall fulfill the promise I made to you. You will know the truth about your identity... I will hold nothing back. I... created you. And within you is the crest stone of the progenitor god... I hid the crest stone within your heart in order to revive her. Sweet child... I am sorry. I wanted to see her... see my mother... even if it meant doing that which is forbidden.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,What does it all mean?,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Rhea,"I thought that I could regain all I had lost, if only I could revive my mother... And so I tried to bring her back by creating a body, and then burying a crest stone within it. A young woman I created... my twelfth try after much heartache... was a failure. She grew up lacking the conscience of the progenitor God and fell in love with the captain of the Knights of Seiros. In time, she became pregnant... but she and the child were not able to survive the birth. The child she bore was not breathing, and she herself was in grave danger. The new mother pleaded with me to take the crest stone of the progenitor god from her own body and place it within the baby. If I had done nothing, both mother and child would have died. And so I granted her final wish. As she had hoped, the baby started breathing again... The new life was saved. Your life, sweet child.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Byleth,...,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Rhea,"Well before that, I had saved Jeralt's life using the power of my blood. That means you are the child of a mother born of the progenitor God's crest stone and a father who carried my own blood. I knew, deep in my heart, that you would be capable of housing the conscience of the progenitor god. I was right... And yet, she merely gifted her power to you and then disappeared once more. My dearest wish did not come true… but here you are. You alone wield the power of the progenitor God. And now, I must ask you to use that power to save this world. You must...",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Rhea,What... No... Arrgh!,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,Rhea?! Rhea!,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Flayn,"What is wrong? Please calm yourself, Rhea!",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Rhea,GRAAARGH!,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,Is the power of the crest taking over her body? Why is this happening?!,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Knight Of Seiros,"Seteth! It's terrible! White beasts have appeared all over Garreg Mach! It's hard to believe, but there have been reports that the priests and Knights have been changing form.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,White beasts... Are they the ones Rhea shared her blood and stones with?,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Church Soldier,Seteth! Demonic beasts are heading this way!,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,"They are after Rhea... Professor, our situation is dire. If we do nothing, Fódlan will be destroyed by a rampaging Immaculate One and these children of hers. There is only one way to stop this. We... we must... Damn it! We have no choice but to kill the Immaculate One... to kill Rhea!",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,"It is kept secret, but there is a certain rite that all initiates to high office in the church must undergo. In this rite, one pledges to serve the goddess and in return, receives a Crest Stone fragment and blood. The ones who have transformed alongside Rhea just now are the ones who have accepted those gifts. They will shield Rhea--the Immaculate One, I should say--with their very lives. But if we do not strike her down, Fódlan will have no future. To arms!",negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,"Surrounded already, it seems. The White Beasts are those in whom Rhea's blood flows strongest. Until we get rid of them, we will not be able to so much as touch Rhea.",negative

FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Petra,It is seeming that my understanding of Fódlan tradition is...insufficient. What is happening?,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,It is too dangerous to approach her now. Capture the southern stronghold first to seal the beasts away!,negative
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,"They're coming one by one from the southern stronghold. If we do not capture it, there will be more.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,Let us turn our attention to the Immaculate One.,neutral

FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Seteth,I will inherit the pride of Nabatea. Rest in peace by Sothis's side!,positive
FE16SilverSnow,21-FollowingADream,Flayn,Rhea... How tragic. But there is no time to waste. She must be stopped!,negative

FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Byleth,I understand.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Seteth,"There is something else... I have heard that Rhea is potentially being held captive in the capital. The information could not be confirmed, nor even properly sourced, but even still... We cannot ignore the possibility. Please bear that in mind.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Byleth,"If it's true, we'll find her.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Seteth,Yes. We must not let anything get in the way of rescuing her.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Byleth,I don't believe it.,negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Seteth,"Do not say that. To receive any information at all is surely a boon. If it is true, we must not let anything let in the way of rescuing her.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Flayn,We're finally heading to Enbarr. The capital city of the Empire... So many memories there...,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Caspar,Oh yeah? So you've been there before?,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Flayn,Oh! Um. Yes. Though it was a very long time ago.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Caspar,A very long time? You must have been really young. I'm surprised you remember.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Dorothea,The main stage of the Mittelfrank Opera Company is in the capital... I hope no one from the opera gets swept up in the coming chaos...,negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Linhardt,There are many buildings straight out of the history books in Enbarr. I hope they remain unharmed...,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Dorothea,"You're worried about the buildings? What about the people? You're an odd one, Lin.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Linhardt,I am also worried about the people. I'm sure my father is in a palace in the capital.,negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Flayn,"Many people reside in Enbarr, so we must take care to avoid needless casualties.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Bernadetta,"I don't think Edelgard cares much for avoiding casualties, so that's probably impossible. I bet we'll be fighting until one side or the other is completely destroyed.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Petra,"Bernie, you should be staying away from thoughts like that. We will be defeating her with our full power. Our enemy has great strength, but we will not be losing!",negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Ferdinand,"I could not agree more. Remember, even if our surprise attack works, a force even greater than all of our troops combined awaits us in the capital. Zero casualties is always the goal, but we must not underestimate the situation at hand.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Flayn,"Still, we must not hold ourselves to the same twisted morality that she does. After all, we are here to stop her, not to follow her down her dark path. We all choose to fight back. We are all in this together!",negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Bernadetta,"You're right, Flayn. We've got to try our hardest!",negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Dorothea,A different path from Edelgard...,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Ferdinand,There is no stopping her. The only way to end this is to kill her.,negative

FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Caspar,Let's go! We can't lose!,negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Linhardt,The situation is dire...and so I will do what must be done.,negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Flayn,"I am certain that if we can join our strength, we can win this battle without losing a single soul!",negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Ferdinand,"Professor. At last, the end is nigh. I love the Empire. Part of me wants it to survive. But I know that is not reasonable. The Empire's time has come. What we need now is a mighty leader who can rebuild Fódlan and rule it as a single nation. Nonetheless, it saddens me that we will not have an Adrestian emperor...",negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Linhardt,"They used to call Enbarr the city of Seiros... To assault it, together with the knights, is surreal. If Seiros were alive today, I wonder what she might make of our war... In Enbarr, there was once a Southern Church, and apparently a bishop was dispatched to it. A hundred years ago, the Southern Church became entangled in an insurrection. Until five years ago, the Empire and the church maintained a certain distance from one another.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Caspar,It's such a relief that we've made it this far without having to fight my father.,positive
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Byleth,You'll have to face him at some point.,neutral

FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Byleth,It sounds like you're scared.,negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Caspar,You bet I'm scared! The Imperial army hasn't lost a single battle with my father on the field!,negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Caspar,"If he turns up as a reinforcement during the assault, we might lose. I better make peace with that.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Bernadetta,"Professor! My, um, my mother might be in the city. I don't have many good memories of her if I'm being honest, but she's dearer to me than my father. If you happen to see her, please make sure she's not caught up in all the fighting. She's only a civil servant, so hopefully she takes a cue from her Bernie and stays inside.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Dorothea,"The whole of the capital is going to be a battleground. The city has such a long heritage... Even so, perhaps it deserves to be reduced to ashes for once. But we can't let the commonfolk get hurt. We should try to confine the damage to the noble section of town.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Petra,"Five years ago...Edelgard said a thing to me. Brigid is a vassal of the Empire. But she also said I always have the freedom to be choosing whether I am with or not with her. I will become the ruler of Brigid. So she said I must make my own path. So now, my path and her path will be colliding.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Felix,"The Death Knight is no ordinary knight. I will prey upon him. I will quench my blade's thirst with his blood. His focus is on fighting you, I'm sure. But mine will be the last face he sees.",negative

FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Sylvain,"So Enbarr, the capital of the Empire. It's finally time. I never thought I'd live this long. It's like any battle, really--stay calm, stay focused. Don't give in to the enemy or your own fear.",positive
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Byleth,You seem more serious than usual.,negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Sylvain,"Hey, I'm always serious! When I'm chasing girls or preparing for battle, always serious. That's me...",negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Byleth,We'll get through this together.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Sylvain,"Striking down the Empire is my offering to His Highness. Heh, I left the Kingdom... What am I saying?",negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Mercedes,It's been so long since I've been to the Imperial capital. I used to go to the opera there with my mother and brother. I never thought my return would be like this...,positive
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Annette,"Enbarr... Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I'd be returning like this. Of course, most of the nobles in the Empire make their home in the capital. In the Kingdom, all nobles live in their own domains. So if the capital is attacked, it doesn't affect them directly. What will happen to the Imperial nobles when their capital becomes a battlefield?",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Ingrid,"Once this battle is over, what will become of Faerghus and Fódlan?",neutral

FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Ingrid,"My hope is for a world of peace. A world in which this present turmoil is a thing of the past--the stuff of legends. I believe those who survive the atrocities of war have a duty to create a new, better world. So the sooner we can stamp out such turmoil, the better. We must win, Professor. There is no alternative here. I won't allow for anything else.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Lorenz,"I have been to the Kingdom capital before, but never to the Imperial one. They say it is the biggest city in all Fódlan, so we will no doubt have many civilians to worry about. I hope we can preserve the city. If it is destroyed in the battle, the people will face hardship. I would say we should avoid the use of excessive force, but I suppose that hinges upon the Empire's terms of engagement.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Raphael,We're heading up to Enbarr next. I hope I make it back safe so I can tell my little sis about it! I hear they got a neat opera house there where Manuela used to perform. What was it called again?,positive

FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Leonie,"We're finally going to the capital. This will be my chance to avenge Captain Jeralt. Once we smash the Empire, I'm sure his soul will finally be able to rest in peace.",positive

FE16SilverSnow,18-TheChaosOfWar,Seteth,"Rhea will be somewhere in the city. I wonder if she can sense us coming. If we are able to save her, then I expect you will learn many secrets that have hitherto been kept from you. Are you prepared for that?",neutral

We have searched all over, but we have reached an impasse. Unless we do something, our efforts to find Rhea and rebuild the Church will be stalled indefinitely. Our opportunity to strike back is close at hand. Sadly, we are short on military strength. However, now we have you. Do you recall what Rhea told you five years ago?

FE16SilverSnow,13-ReunionAtDawn,Dorothea,We made a promise with the professor. That was five years ago to the very day.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,13-ReunionAtDawn,Petra,We all gave our promise to be meeting here when the millennium festival arrived.,neutral

FE16SilverSnow,13-ReunionAtDawn,Byleth,What's your reason for being here?,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,13-ReunionAtDawn,Seteth,"Actually... Well, it would be easier to just show you. Come with me to the Holy Mausoleum. I realize that since you have been slumbering for so long, you have no idea what has transpired in the various territories. Allow me to explain... After the Battle of Garreg Mach, there was a change of regime in the Kingdom. House Blaiddyd suffered a series of brutal massacres, which claimed the lives of Dimitri and Regent Rufus. The Kingdom capital fell and was absorbed into the Empire as the Faerghus Dukedom, which is now under Cornelia's control. Some still resist the Empire. As of now, Rodrigue of House Fraldarius is at the center of such efforts. In the Alliance, Claude leads the faction that opposes the Empire, and Lorenz leads those who have sided with them. The front lines are ever in motion, but the war effort has stagnated overall. In short, both the Kingdom and the Alliance have been swallowed up by the Empire and are on the verge of collapse. We must gather our generals and soldiers under your command and reverse this dire situation.",negative

FE16SilverSnow,13-ReunionAtDawn,Seteth,"After we finished here, we were going to continue our search for Rhea. But now that you are here, things have changed. We must not waste this opportunity. We shall send word to the knights scattered all across the land. The time has come for the Knights of Seiros to return to action. We are counting on you, Professor!",positive
FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Church Soldier,Emergency! In Gronder Field... There's a... It's...,negative

FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Church Soldier,"Yes, sir! It seems that the Kingdom and Alliance armies clashed with Imperial forces on Gronder Field!

FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Seteth,"It must have been a brutal fight. To have lost His Highness... How tragic. Our only solace is that Edelgard sustained severe injuries. This is all quite unexpected, but we must find a way to use this situation to our advantage. The Empire's main force has suffered a mighty blow. Edelgard will most certainly avoid the front lines. Now is the time for us to infiltrate the Empire and aim for the capital.",negative
FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Flayn,But...what will happen to the lords of the old Kingdom and Alliance territories?,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Seteth,They have lost many leaders and soldiers. I am sure they must be hard at work rebuilding. We will foster cooperation by aiding them through the local churches. The remaining lords of the Kingdom and Alliance must join together to form one union. And you should be the one to lead them... What do you say?,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Byleth,In time...,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Byleth,I can't decide that just yet.,neutral

FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Byleth,Let's decide where to invade first.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Seteth,We must choose a place within the Empire that will give us solid defenses for our front line... That will become the foothold for our invasion of the capital. There is one massive fortress that boasts the greatest defenses in the Empire...Fort Merceus. But we will stand no chance if we attack by traditional means. We must gather everyone and devise a plan of attack.,neutral

FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Byleth,Where did he go?,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Seteth,Hm? I am the only one here. Were you dreaming?,neutral

FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Seteth,"I can't say for certain that you were dreaming, but if someone did come here to see you... That person only wanted you to see their face. Perhaps they wanted you to guide them...",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Ferdinand,"Dimitri, the late prince of Faerghus. He despised the Empire with all his heart. He should not have tried leading an army while his emotions were holding him captive.",negative

FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Byleth,"Don't leaders have feelings, like everyone else?",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Ferdinand,"True enough, but I suspect the reason he died is that he could not keep his emotions in check. I see. You are saying you met with Dimitri? But you could not tell if it was reality or a dream. Hm. I wonder what it could mean.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Linhardt,"I'm rather curious to see what stratagem we'll devise to capture the fortress. You know Fort Merceus's nickname, I assume. The Stubborn Old General? But there must be one or two gaps in its defenses...",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Caspar,"Fort Merceus is next, huh? Ah, the memories. It's a huge stronghold in my father's domain. The town's completely surrounded by high walls. I used to run around there when I was a kid... Way back when a fortress was a playground for me. Yeah, those were the days.",neutral
FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Bernadetta,"It's always so peaceful coming back here. But it's hard to relax knowing we have to go out on another expedition again so soon. And assaulting that huge keep? That sounds hard. Oh, really, hard! Don't you think it'll be hard?!",negative

FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Dorothea,"I heard that a staggering number of people lost their loves in the battle at Gronder.

FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Petra,I have excitement in my heart for secret tactics! I enjoy attacks that are surprising.,positive

FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Petra,Surprise attacks are safe with friends. Fewer injuries.,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Byleth,Because it's like hunting?,neutral
FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Petra,Yes. Hunting is doing surprise attacks on prey. Surprise attacks are safe with friends. Fewer injuries.,negative
FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Felix,It hasn't sunk in yet. They slaughtered the boar... I can hardly believe it. I thought he was alive all this time. He must have really hated Edelgard to lead such an ill-advised assault. Hmph. No point in feeling sorry for the poor scoundrel now.,negative
FE16SilverSnow,17-TheImpregnableFortress,Ashe,I've heard Dedue's passed on. Just like His Highness.,neutral

And that means your only option is to pass through the east. You'll have to cross the Airmid River, which runs along the border between the Empire and the Alliance. That means you'll need to gain control of the Great Bridge of Myrddin, the one closest to Garreg Mach. It just so happens that my family, House Riegan, is in conflict with House Gloucester right now. It would be easy enough for us to eliminate them, but I would prefer that we settle things without it coming to that. Do you see where I'm going with this? We'll act as a distraction and draw House Gloucester away from there. That will allow you to cross through their territory and take the Great Bridge of Myrddin. After you take the bridge from the Imperial army, House Gloucester won't be able to receive their aid. You'll get to cross Myrddin without any trouble, and I'll be able to maintain stability in the Alliance. Not a bad deal, eh? I hope to hear from you soon. Be well, Teach.",negative
