sir ced dyou reckon the kids are safe
think of it the way raydrik would would you send a convoy all the way to belhalla with only three or four children or would you wait until you have plenty to show for yourself theres still time asbel
then we can send em all back home their moms must be awful worried
focus asbel theres too many guards about to celebrate just yet
yessir
listen closely after youve rescued the children i want you to rejoin brighton and seek out prince leif of house leonster
c come again prince leif
indeed he fell prey to some trap of raydriks and was imprisoned in this very castle  asbel whats wrong youre white as a sheet
lord leif was a dear friend of mine ysee we got separated in tarrah years ago an ive been looking for him ever since for three whole years ive been searching 
then look alive today is the day youve been waiting for find the prince and escape munster with him ive ordered all magi outside the castle to flee manster as well well be sitting ducks if we stay here much longer 
are you coming with us
i  considered it but i cant theres many villagers and townsfolk left in munster and they need my aid just as much
youve spent this whole time teachin me an i cant even help you in return some apprentice i turned out to be 
no this is my choice asbel its no fault of yours besides all i really taught you was that grafcalibur spell do me proud and use it to protect prince leif
sir ced will  will we see each other again
if prince leif is the hero weve been waiting for then the long night is finally over and thracia will breathe free again  we will see each other again asbel right here in munster
munster  r right munster it is dont you forget it sir ced
sniffle  sniffle 
cmon knock off the waterworks

dont make them soldiers mad at us again theyll just tell us to quit yer bellyachin like last time 
i dont care if they get mad if i get caught cryin an they get angry  maybe theyll jus send me home  i jus wanna go home 
lord leif  after all these years its me asbel
asbel what in the world are you doing here why arent you still in tarrah
i set off after you just as soon as we got separated lotta good that did  i couldnt figure out where youd gone for the last half year now i been stickin around munster
you left tarrah that quickly then  youve spent the last three years looking for me 
of course i did i promised you as much remember with your blade and my magic we were gonna take thracia back together but you just up an left me behind that  that was awful heartless of you leif er lord leif
im sorry  at the time i didnt have a choice tarrah had been surrounded by the empire i had  i had prepared myself for the very real possibility of dying when i fled i never imagined i would make it out alive i didnt want to drag you down with me so i left you out of it
what a load of pegasus dung  we swore to live and die together didnt we or was that whole oath just part of some kids game ive spent all these years with those words etched into my mind and i chose to believe in them
a asbel 
lord leif if only for my sake you have to liberate thracia make it so that my years of searching meant something
lord ced oh lord ced after all this time 
yes wait  karin has something happened why have you left silesse
to  to find you my prince
to find me   oh for heavens sake  did fee put you up to this or was it my mother
   lord ced i have some  important news for you
is that so well lets hear it
w well to tell the truth  oh gods    
karin if you have something to tell me speak quickly and to the point this is no time for weakness
y youre right  i  i regret to inform you that her majesty the queen has  she um 
mother no she cant have 
im  afraid so milord two months ago 
mother is  my mother has  passed away 
lord ced  im sorry you shouldnt have found out like this here of all places 
does it matter i was too late  father  i wanted them to see each other one last time 
lord ced return to silesse with me please lady fee is waiting for you
fee  how is she is she all right
silesse faces dire times milord lady fee can put up a tough front for the others but when its just me an her she  she cries till her eyes dry up lord ced with respect youve done her a great cruelty runnin away like you did lady fee isnt much more than a kid and youve gone and forced the burden of ruling silesse onto her that holy blood in your veins has gone to your head youre the heir to forsetis legacy good for you but you up an walked out on your mother and sister does that sound like what a hero would do does that even sound like what a real prince would do
karin i  youre right of course but  but father was the only one who could cure mothers illness i couldnt do her any good just waiting at her side was i supposed to just sit there and watch her waste away so i  i went to find father by whatever means i could
then why are you leading some rebel group in munster
i heard tell that my father had been here in munster until half a year ago i came here to pick up the trail but when i arrived he had already left but after seeing the it had gone cold as i investigated i discovered just how deeply the people of munster suffered i couldnt abandon them as my father had abandoned silesse
is that right  i apologize lord ced  i shouldve heard your side of the story before judging you 
im sorry karin but i need more time if i can drive that menace raydrik from munster ill gladly return to silesse by my estimation that should only take a half  year at most
 youre fixin to overthrow that creep huh now thats a plan i can get behind count me in ill stay here with you
heh im flattered karin but as your prince i insist you head back to silesse i couldnt fight knowing you were endangering yourself
 thats a diplomatic way of saying i would be a burden but youre right i would just slow you down all right ill make my way back to silesse but only if you promise to come home yourself lord ced
you have my word and as proof of my vow i bestow this upon you
er what is it a used handkerchief
hah would you believe this is an heirloom of the silessian royal family its an ancient scroll penned by my namesake the crusader ced himself he imbued it with potent magic that strengthens whoever so much as holds it i was  supposed to give it to my betrothed actually instead i entrust it to you karin
are you really trusting me with something so valuable i  this is most unexpected
karin  i did wrong by my mother and im sorry i owe you much for helping fee in my absence and this is a token of my gratitude i want you to have it
 ok but im only keeping it safe for you youll get it back the second you return to silesse
then the snowy banks of silesse shall be witness to our next meeting be well karin
you said it gods be with you lord ced

/***EOF***/
reuniting with the remnants of the freeblades of fiana leif made his way west carrion the knight entrusted to him by general hannibal served as his guide through the treacherous mountain range they now approached the foot of mount violdrake home to dagdar and his familiar group of brigands 
ah feel that earthy mountain air thats how you can tell were just at the base of mount violdrake
your help has been invaluable carrion you should make your way back to general hannibal we can take it from here
im  not returning to thracia milord i told general hannibal of my intentions and he gave me his blessing
what
do you think the general a fool he knew full well who you really were as does half the thracian peninsula rumors of a surviving leonster heir have been circulating for years anyone with sense knew it was only a matter of time until this survivor took up arms and rallied an army to battle the empire i always expected nay prayed that this day would come and now i have the honor of taking part in the liberation myself the motherland shall soon breathe free again
motherland you  mean to say youre not thracian
indeed i was born to a sworn knight of house leonster my father perished in the war but my mother and i were taken in by general hannibal ah  but im being presumptuous arent i if it pleases you prince leif i want nothing more than to fight for house leonster again and reclaim our sovereign land
im  not sure that im the liege you seek frankly i dont know that i have power enough to reclaim leonster for the time being i merely want to aid tarrah
even so as long as i fight beneath the banner of house leonster i care not what the cause is if you wish us elsewhere milord so be it assuming you accept my oath i suggest we make for general hannibals villa
hm general hannibal didnt seem the type to own a lavish mountain villa 
hes not the villa is a safehouse for those like me the many refugees of the fallen families of leonster there under the protection of general hannibal duke dryas trains us in the ways of knighthood
d did i hear you correctly dryas  i can scarcely believe it  duke dryas is alive 
see for yourself milord shall we be off
of course at once being able to see duke dryas again  its like a waking dream
begging your pardon my prince but ive a matter of some urgency the bandits of this area dagdars gang to be precise are out in force and seem to be pillaging a nearby village what are your orders sire
say no more i apologize carrion but it seems duke dryas will have to wait will you aid me in defending the villagers
hah you neednt ask id be worried if you didnt want to help them milord still this is most curious  this is dagdars territory and the villages are under his protection why are they attacking 
all right pay up your crew might be happy spendin all day stickin up farmers but i got an actual army to get back to
change of plans gonna need you to put in a little extra elbow grease looks like theres a whole group of folk comin this way dunno why theyre here but i need you to keep em clear of the manor while im inside once thats done youll get every coin
damn this was just supposed to be a one time thing  all right fine but itll cost you extra if you want me to stick around
ugh i didnt know gomes an his boys were gonna take forever and a day hmm  this aint worth it cant get caught up in this whole scene an have someone recognize me 
calm down marty he aint recognized you  now wait fer an openin and run for the hills 
hm wait youre  hey marty ol buddy
what marty dont know no marty havent even heard the name before 
marty pal i could spot that chin of yours from a mile away what are you doing here
er well  it werent my idea i swear it was all gomes idea he made me do it 
that isnt the problem here cmon marty raiding villages you think thats what dagdar would want or the commander if youve seen fit to go against everything they taught you then youre just another bandit and i got no choice but to cut you down
wait wait i   boy you sure know how to guilt trip a guy dontcha musta learned it from that father of yours  sigh when yer right yer right it was wrong of me to go along with this 
 so youre with us then youll help us fight off these bandits
f f fight off the bandits even gomes er  well ysee  i uh 
argh you should be ashamed marty just man up and say it are you with us or against us
im with you ill help you fight the bandits just  please dont yell at me no more 
calm down marty he aint recognized you  now wait fer an openin and run for the hills 
hm is that  marty is that you
what marty dont know no marty havent even heard the name before 
marty youre tall enough to be a lightning rod i could spot you all the way from belhalla what i cant figure out is why youre here 
er well  it werent my idea i swear it was all gomes idea he made me do it 
he made me do it listen to yourself marty its not enough that youre raiding villages youve gotta make up excuses too
i couldnt do nuthin about it it aint my fault 
 all right were going in circles here just tell me one thing have you gone against what dagdar and the commander taught you are you just a common bandit now
w well when you put it like that  i  g guess it was wrong of me to go along with this 
then youre still a friend of the freeblades right so youll fight alongside us like a friend would
  
marty
y yessir course i will sir
sorry for your luck but i need the coin i got no illusions  i know this is wrong
elaine  mahal  min  im sorry  p papa isnt comin home 
whether i like it or not youve extended me a mercy one i didnt offer you as for this whole banditry business  i think the one time was enough ill find some other way to support my kids somethin honest
somehow these things just keep happenin to me 
wh why me  whatd i do 
er  look i know i done wrong ok i didnt wanna fight you honest but i had no choice they made me
thats the end of that i suppose 
seems weve largely disposed of the bandits sire
without dagdar to keep them in line look how quickly they reverted to this savagery 
im reminded of a certain proverb a thousand pegasi led by one dragon can defeat a thousand dragons led by one pegasus there is nothing more essential than the authority a man answers to a king a god a conscience a code  through it evil men can be led to do good and good men can be led to do evil weve seen as much with dagdars men here this is true of any group be it a grand army or a small gang of bandits the example set by their leader is what the people will follow  do you understand prince leif
 yes i must take that lesson to heart
prince leif ive brought the man claiming to be in charge of these ruffians
let me get a look at you  wait you were in charge of these brigands why is the thracian coat of arms on your breastplate then
its no business of yours junior just take my head and be done with it
no theres been enough blood spilled today ill make you a deal indulge my questions and you have my word youll walk free
i could  walk free oh thats a cruel joke if i accepted mercy from an enemy id bring shame to the dracoknights
just before we arrived here i also had to choose between my survival and accepting help from an enemy i  know how it feels i take it you have a wife children perhaps if i have to kill you here theyll be out on the street is that what you want
  
im sure you had your reasons for doing this as far as im concerned i dont even need to know who you are or what your station is tell me what i want to know and i have no reason to pursue you
 ask your question
the lord of that manor dagdar and his daughter tanya where are they
   theyre inside and theyre not alone gomes the one who hired me hes makin his move on em didnt say exactly what his plans were but he didnt have to i could tell he was fixin to kill em both
i see  thank you august see that this man and his dragon mount are freed at once
 as you wish
 sorry for the trouble for what its worth
dagdar youre all right
well ill be  prince leif heh an here i was the one who was supposed to be rescuin you sorry fer draggin ya into my mess  so wheres eyvel she head back to fiana or is she with you
  
prince  what happened
eyvel is  still in munster we  didnt have the forces to rescue her i couldnt save her 
wh what dammit leif are you a real prince or just a child how the hell could ya just leave her
there was nothing i could do i  i wasnt strong enough wasnt fast enough i  with my meager strength what good am i to anyone what should i do what can i do
  
if  if id just been a little stronger  if i had done things differently maybe 
dammit prince yer puttin too much of the blame on yerself
but 
look im sorry fer yellin at you just now i  i wasnt expecting things to go so wrong an i took it out on you truth be told prince yer toughern most you tried to rescue her right ya made the effort and it aint yer fault it didnt work out
d dagdar 
sure you kids are goin through some rough times right now no doubt but quit yer worryin cuz ill be helpin ya from now on it aint like anybody can replace eyvel but you still got a long way to go before this war is lost an hey captured aint dead right well get eyvel back together
l lord leif 
tanya  its good to see you again
yeah i guess  theres not much to it really gomes just let me go after he found out that papa was already dead he  he said he was sorry about the village there was no point to this whole damn attack with papa long since buried 
i see  listen tanya im  truly sorry for what happened to your father 
no its ok  papa did what he thought was right if he died for something he mustve really believed in it
what will you do now tanya if you dont have any other plans perhaps  perhaps you could come with us
is  is that really all right with you having me tag along
of course youre always welcome with us
yeah  yeah this is just what i need you bet your light brand ill come with you th thank you
/***EOF***/
having seized the infamous fort dandrum leifs liberation army was keenly aware just how little time remained before the empire launched its assault on tarrah scarcely taking a moment to catch their breath the liberation army kept marching well into the evening determined to come to the citys defense before it was too late when they finally arrived at the edges of dakia forest which extends around tarrahs eastern border it was the dead of night the thick foliage obscured what little moonlight had been illuminating their path and the forest was now blanketed in a deep foreboding darkness 
perne your shift is done let me take over for you on lookout
its already past dusk salem how can you be this energetic now especially with how bad you were roughed up
come now it was all thanks to you that i managed to survive ill be fine
still those loptian lunatics are a sadistic bunch aint they if we hadnt happened to pass by youd have been a goner for sure
  the loptr church never forgives betrayal that is one of their highest tenets 
betrayal is a bit of a stretch aint it i mean you just said you wanted to leave the order thats all it aint right to kill a man just because he wants to go his own way  but i gotta ask you whyd you want to leave in the first place i hear the loptian bishops have even more power than the emperor now thats an awful luxurious position to just walk away from
i  no longer understood the order that was my reason nothing more nothing less
hmm  simple as that huh i like the cut of your jib kid how about you join up with me and my crew we could use someone like you if youre up for it that is
i admit your  unusual sense of ethics hasnt gone unnoticed by me youre bandits true but you do not kill and you refuse to steal from the poor so long as you continue to abide by that code ill agree to stay here
im not in the hobby of murder myself but our crew has swelled in number lately and i cant say the same for the new folks especially this one hothead colho him and his lackeys are gettin antsy about how i wont let them drop any bodies during a heist
its more than that colho and his followers are truly wicked men theyve been attacking travelers and passing merchants
ah  so you already heard about them huh ill get right to the point then im plannin on cuttin ties with the lot of them long as troude comes with me i can manage just fine of course im hoping youll also come along salem
dont forget about tina see that youre mindful of her feelings and dont be too harsh with her shes little more than a child
hah  all right all right anyhow im headed back inside looks like you get your wish cuz im trusting you with guard duty dont say i never did anything for you just be on the lookout for the imperial army with all the troops theyre sending to tarrah they might come through the forest if they find us well be sitting ducks
not to worry if anyone draws near ill use my sleep staff to send them into a deep nights slumber
 well i must be off i do apologize for burdening you so but please for my sake watch over the child
yer moren welcome bishop just leave everything to me and dont you fret about it fer one moment longer
bishop saias  are you leaving already
im afraid so i must return to grannvale i regret having to leave you behind like this but your wounds seem to have healed nicely youll be just fine on your own
 i dont know how i can ever repay you bishop if not for you i 
you certainly dont lack for gratitude but everything else about you your stance your face is marred by regret what happened was unavoidable your will was pitted against darkness itself and the shadow swords influence was strong indeed your penitence for turning the blade against your mother is beyond question youd do well to put the memory behind you but if my words alone cannot convince you i offer the sword itself as proof ive dispelled the curse placed upon the blade now i offer it to you as a symbol that no darkness is impenetrable and no regret is irredeemable
y you want me to use that damned sword im not laying a finger on that foul thing ever again
you want to carry on your mothers legacy and become a swordmaster do you not if thats your goal you must learn to understand weapons in a different light all weapons all swords are the product of human intent they are what they are because their creator wished them to be that way holy blades and cursed blades alike were forged by the hands of men they are an extension of will a manifestation of purpose take the shadow sword use it for your own ends assert your will over that which once robbed you of it in so doing you can rewrite the legacy of this evil blade into something more use its power to forge a new future for it and for yourself if you wish to live as a swordmaster you must learn to cherish all blades for they are the tools that allow you to enact your will see them not as reminders of the past but as means to achieve a new future for if you cannot unshackle yourself from the past you cannot call yourself a swordmaster
i  think i understand ill wield the sword and cherish it as a symbol of how not even the foulest magic could overcome my mothers love for me
very good if you have the resolve to keep that sword in hand ive a feeling that the gods may reunite you with your mother someday with that im afraid i must be going ive lingered here much too long i doubt that well cross paths again but i pray you find happiness
the same to you bishop saias be well  thank you for everything
look alive lads seems some fresh game ave wandered our way keep quiet an move in close then do em in whatever valuables they got we all split equally  what oh dont tell me you lot are worried about what perne will say look ill take care of perne myself he wont be a problem no more the rest of you while youre dealin with those travelers go after the villages an take anything worth carryin
whats all that noise whats wrong
the villages round here are bein raided by bandits thats what everyones scared to death that theyll come here next
are they the local bandit group ive heard the villagers mention
no no no thats the dandelion yer thinkin of an they would never stoop to plunderin a village like this matter of fact theyve even helped us when we needed it cant be the dandelion id bet me life on it it must be them rough types that turned up here not too long ago 
well whoever they are you dont need to worry ill protect every last one of you
what in blazes are you thinkin you  look an awful lot like me daughter yknow a pretty little thing like you cant expect to go toe to toe with bandits
no im a swordswoman a myrmidon like my mother before me im the daughter of eyvel of fiana no mere bandit could defeat me
salem er sir
oh tina what can i do for you
i brought you a midnight snack what with it being so cold out i figured you could use a nice hot meal
thats very kind of you tina but it gets dangerous out here at night i dont want you getting hurt you should stay inside and get your rest ladies need their beauty sleep or so im told
aw youre no fun 
 wait youre worried about your sister arent you is that whats keeping you awake you said her name was safy right well you neednt worry one moment longer you will see her again ill make sure of that once my wounds have healed ill help you find her
d do you mean it oh thank you salem youre just the best well ill get out of your hair how do you get your hair like that anyway and let you get back to lookout or whatever nighty night salem  you better not forget your promise
dawn is breaking prince leif our troops can see clearly once more
begone from our forest invaders
perne  i dont have any regrets 
is that so  youre just letting me go hmm  what to make of you people
aw hell we blundered into a bunch of soldiers
argggh you  rotten 
dammit ill remember this
this seems to be the bandits hideout prince leif the night is still young i advise that we seize this opportunity to purge tarrahs borders of these vermin
ive no objections but what of our troops arent the men exhausted
im afraid so between the long march from fort dandrum and the skirmish here our forces have little strength left at most we could only spare a small strike team of five soldiers to accompany you the decision is yours milord
 ill do it if we rout these bandits once and for all the villagers here will finally be able to breathe easy
l leif little lord is that you
 mareeta mareeta it really is you how  how did you wind up here
im just as surprised as you are i never expected id see you and everyone from fiana again so soon hah  im halfway convinced this is just a dream
mareeta i  i beg your forgiveness for what happened to your mother it was my fault that the commander  that she 
if what happened is anyones fault its mine i was  i was inexperienced and weak and  and i couldnt overcome the power of that sword i didnt have the discipline to resist it 
 mareeta this i swear to you ill get the commander back whatever it takes
you mean we well get mother back together please leif i want to be a part of this ill be stronger than i was before you must let me join you
of course ill have you though as much as it pains me its not feasible for our army to return to manster with things the way they are right now  but someday well be able to go back for the commander you can count on that and when that day comes theres no force in all the heavens that can keep the two of us from getting her back
couldnt have said it better myself little lord
/***EOF***/
an enormous price had been placed on leifs head and countless bounty hunters were determined to claim it whats more the knights of munster had doggedly pursued leif and their forces were growing dangerously close 
prince leif the knights of munster will catch up with us before long
what should i do
there are two options first you could flee through the mountain range to the west and lose the knights in the rocky terrain second you could continue south and seek refuge in castle meath in either case it will be necessary to petition thracia for aid immediately
a ask thracia for aid thats absurd those damnable cowards took everything from me my kingdom my mother my father  ill not come crawling to them with cup in hand
do you expect to fight off the knights of munster with the strength of your pride alone we are not fighting to satisfy your own sense of vengeance my prince we fight to liberate north thracia from the tyranny of the empire you yourself said that there was no hardship you would be unwilling to endure to accomplish this did you think the only kind of hardship in this war would be from battle
 even supposing i did agree what makes you think we can trust thracia theyre allies of the empire
and if foreign invaders amass at their borders theyll respond with force all the same i imagine the retaliation from general hannibal of meath would be especially great hes a famed military leader that the people revere as the shield of thracia between us and raydriks men who do you think he would help
 i understand well take refuge in castle meath and head for tarrah afterward
you want to make for tarrah  as in the city refusing to take part in child hunts the same city being besieged by the imperial army for their rebellion going there with the small force we have now is certain death does my prince wish an early grave
tarrah is  my home away from home you could say the duke of tarrah sheltered me for years and was killed by the empire for it i have many friends there august i wont abandon them now
 very well but lets discuss this later right now focus on our escape
 whats all the ruckus
couple rebels in munster kicked the hornets nest i hear the ringleader is a youngun named leif a leonster prince with a price on is head to match the boys got stones all right almost seems like a shame to kill im but coin is coin hes comin our way already havent had a bounty this convenient in a long while
hmm 
welcome back general hannibal
i see our dungeon is considerably more full than when i departed what pray tell happened while i was away
a group of suspicious characters were making their way down the mountains near here so we saw fit to arrest them i reckon theyre bandits from the eastern frontier
hmm  what have they to say for themselves
were just villagers and other obvious tripe what kind of villagers trek through the thracian mountains they must be up to something otherwise why lie
understood ill go have a word with the prisoners myself in the meantime theres some sort of commotion over in munster raydrik may be up to something  lets not give the twofold traitor any openings eh
hah of course milord
were just villagers and other obvious tripe what kind of villagers trek through the thracian mountains they must be up to something otherwise why lie whats more we saw what looked like a knight among them but the man escaped weve assembled search parties to find him
understood ill go have a word with the prisoners myself in the meantime theres some sort of commotion over in munster raydrik may be up to something  lets not give the twofold traitor any openings eh
hah of course milord
i must reach lord leif at once  ah i pray that hes still safe 
i cannot allow myself to be delayed any longer sister please make your way back to tarrah
am i that much of a burden to you sir finn
not at all your presence has been most heartening but where i go im not certain i could protect you
when i left tarrah i swore to saint heim that for those willing to defend the city there was nothing i wouldnt do if i can help lord leif and in so doing help tarrah then i must we are both bound by duty sir finn allow me to uphold my own oath
 i understand sister lets get moving before we lose any more daylight
the rebels have a head start but theyre only on foot aizenau chase them down with your knights and eliminate them dont allow them to set even one foot on castle meaths soil
aye milord but  thracia is our sworn ally why would the rebels head to castle meath
oh please  thracia and the empire can mix no better than oil and water we may be allies but were certainly not friends if the rebels have any sense theyll use that to their advantage
ah  i see
perhaps im overestimating them but ill not be made a fool of twice still we cant overplay our hand hannibals elite knights the panzerritter lie in wait inside the castle attacking them would be tantamount to a declaration of war if they take the field you must not lay a hand on them no matter what
aye milord
the knights of munster dare to cross the border raydrik do you hold me in such contempt as to attack so brazenly men of the panzerritter sortie and engage the knights well show them the wrath of meath
h hannibal himself has taken the field of all the times for that doddering fool to show his face  all knights fall back retreat to munster
lord leif youre all right
im sorry to have worried you finn
worried of  of course not i never doubted youd be able to keep yourself safe i just  didnt expect wed meet again so soon
you can thank the magi for that
magi  i assumed your retinue to be made up of common sellswords and former knights  who are they then
theyre a group of rebels from up north theyve pledged to serve me until the day that munster stands free
their loyalty to you is most important above all if theyve promised you as much their personal details are none of my concern though now that i get a look at everyone  i dont see eyvel among them milord is she 
the commander is still in munster  she  she was turned to stone by the fell magic of a loptian bishop theres  nothing i can do for her now 
gods breath th that cant be  lord leif  im sorry i  i dont know what to say 
youve nothing to apologize for finn as for the commander  nothing will stop me from getting her back between the two of us were sure to find a way to reverse whats been done to her so finn  im giving you an order dont die i want you there with me head held high on the day we take back munster
gladly milord on my honor never again shall you and i be parted ill be at your side brave lance in hand until the very end
thank you finn   ahem now where has the rest of our former group gone
they were captured by general hannibals panzerritter and imprisoned in castle meath i  considered rescuing them but my duty to you comes first so i set out without them
then our road leads to meath regardless very well  finn lets head for the castle and see to their release with our forces bolstered we can make our way to tahra  youve missed the city as well havent you i can tell
ah  i have milord
hm oh youre 
ah sister  its been a while
why are you doing this i know youre not a bad person
this is the job im a sellsword and frankly the details are no business of yours  time for you to leave sister im trouble to be around
im not going anywhere
 you really willing to risk everything for that little boy
if it came to that i would give my life to protect prince leif yes
  
losing prince leif losing what he represents would be an irreplaceable loss to the entire thracian peninsula if i needed to give my life to save his it would only be right to do so
hmph  youre quite the fool sister  well all the better i can appreciate that kind of naïve innocence
hm will you  agree to aid the prince then
ah this is getting absurd  but yes i suppose i will just one thing dont talk so lightly about throwing your life away theres nothing more loathsome than people rushing toward their own death
i apologize  ill be mindful of that
can i ask you something though what is it that you want what is it that brightens your day that brings you laughter
i suppose that i want to see everyone around me be happy when they laugh when they feel joy i share in it
i see  well i already said you were quite the fool  you know i dont think i even know your name im shiva of savan by the way what do you go by
safy im safy of tarrah
youre going to tarrah then take this antidote if you ever get hit by poison just rub this on the wound and itll go away just like that ive heard the rogues in the west use poisoned weapons youll be glad you took this antidote along
p please i just couldnt resist dont take me away  huh youre not the castle guards oh  just forget what i said then here ill give you this to keep your mouth shut
if you have the time why dont you visit the arena to the south if you fight and win youll get rewarded with cash and its a good way to test your skills oh but youll die if you lose so dont get carried away you must never overdo anything if you do decide to go then take this im sure itll be of some use
you stubborn idiots think you can defeat me
what madness  i cant  believe  they 
clearly your group wanted to flee munster but i would hear your reasons
most of us lived in a village on the eastern shore i was  captured while freeing several children from an imperial prison the magi the local resistance later rescued me and we fled the province together
hmm  for one so young you dont seem to bend easily whats your name lad
lugh faris at your service general hannibal
hmm  you share  quite the resemblance 
resemblance what do you mean general 
its  nothing you need concern yourself with more importantly what do you plan to do now that youre free of munster
well head to tarrah to break the siege on the city ive many friends there in need of help
are you planning a route through the central mountains
that was my intent yes as rebels we obviously cant risk crossing through imperial territory
is that so then be warned many bandits make their home there dont let your guard down
thank you general now would you release the men you captured earlier theyre good friends of mine
ah of course men bring the prisoners here on the double
yes general
prince leif sheesh some help i turned out to be huh might as well have stayed in fiana for all the good i did 
damned thracians next time i see you youll pay for what youve done
im awful sorry prince leif  i guess im just not very strong 
good folk let me introduce you to carrion there are many perils in the central mountains not the least of which is a massive hunt for bandits around mount violdrake if youre mistaken for these bandits you could very well lose your lives over it carrion here will see that you cross the mountains safely
of course sire they can count on me
general theres no need to reassign your man we dont need to go as far into the mountains as mount violdrake im sure theres a detour we can find 
nonsense id be honored to join you
 if you insist i certainly would appreciate your help
think nothing of it
sir lugh youd best be setting out itll be dark before long
of course many thanks for your help general hannibal i wont forget the kindness youve done us
good day sir
oh you were one of the children imprisoned at kelves gate  what are you doing here
general hannibal is my lord father you see on the off chance we met again i prepared you a token of my gratitude here you are its a very powerful staff imbued with warp magic
thank you this is most generous 
sir lugh youd best be setting out itll be dark before long
of course many thanks for your help general hannibal i wont forget the kindness youve done us
/***EOF***/
putting down the bandit uprising at mount violdrake leifs army now sought to join forces with the remnants of leonsters nobility leif set a course for general hannibals mountain villa where the deposed nobles now lived in hiding 
is this the area merlock
thats correct sire
hmph  so these bandits are harassing thracian citizens even for your average brigand thats stupid
exceptionally stupid even so my lord father you didnt need to come here in person for such a trifle
and what kind of king would i be if i wasnt aware of all the matters that trouble my realm trifling or no besides its been too long since you and i had an outing of our own altena
indeed father im glad we were able to spend time together
shame that arion couldnt join us i wanted him to come along but he didnt want the capital to be left unattended in our absence
hes merely taking after your example father
mm when i was his age id already taken the throne arion needs to keep at it if he wants to outpace me
hes doing his best and so am i i want only to be a pillar of strength for our family my lord father
good the two of you are thracias future the north abounds with crops and the mountains of the south hide much in the way of resources and riches an independent thracia will need both not just one or the other to have a single united thracia  my fondest wish is to return this land to what it was in the days of dáinn and njorun  even if it damns me to the deepest pit of hell
 father
altena 
yes
 the winds changing on us lets head back and leave this one to merlock
as you wish my lord father
you good to handle this on your own merlock
hah you insult me by asking sire
all right then im entrusting you with the rest of our soldiers i wont accept any excuses wipe out every last bandit show them what its like to have made an enemy of thracia
leave everything to me milord
my lord father its the thracian army t theyre flooding in from the south
so travant has finally noticed us  a pox on it all with glade in tarrah theres no one here with any experience in battle 
then leave it to me ill draw their attention and buy everyone time to escape
wait general hannibal sent word ahead according to him prince leif and a coalition of warriors from fiana and munster are already en route we have to hold out until they get here 
understood if youve no objections ill establish a defensive perimeter cain alva robert were moving out follow me
the villa is just ahead prince leif
is something amiss those soldiers moving about are they duke dryas troops
hm blast  take a closer look at their armor prince leif thats the thracian army
wh what wasnt this villa supposed to be under the protection of general hannibal
perhaps thracia finally learned of their presence or perhaps general hannibal tipped them off 
ill not hear it august general hannibal is a man of honor hed not do such a thing
 be that as it may we must move to rescue them immediately if that villa falls any hope of liberating thracia or rebuilding leonster falls with it
prince leif oh its been too long milord its me selphina
selphina in the flesh can it really be you
prince leif  this halfway feels like a dream  when i last saw you milord you were but a child a toddler who fell asleep at my knees  youve grown into such a fine young man 
oh selphina its enough to make me cry  i had thought you and duke dryas were killed trying to protect me i never imagined id be able to see you again i  never knew my mother or sister the kinship of family was the one thing my retainers were never able to fetch for me i saw lachesis as a sort of mother and you as the older sister i was never able to meet not that i ever showed you much gratitude for it i remember being quite the little terror 
oh it would be terribly improper to ever say such a thing of the prince of leonster ill have to take you at your word milord i  take it that lady lachesis still has yet to return
im afraid so  she  never made it back from her excursion to isaach
i see  well dont give up hope its still possible that shes alive somewhere alive and happy im sure youll find her someday prince leif after all the two of us were able to meet again were we not
sir finn its been too long
hold are you friend or enemy
have you forgotten me already sir finn its selphina
selphina duke dryas daughter
the very same
you dont say  when last we met you still wore your hair in braids 
i can only hope im more of a proper woman now than i was a decade past glade and i have since been wed you see
glade that old dog hows he been ah weve much catching up to do you must take me to him at once
your reunion will have to wait a little longer im afraid hes away in tarrah trying to aid the citys defenders
a pity  still if duty calls i suppose it cant be helped
hmph you can barely hide your excitement for seeing my husband but you cant scrape together two words for my benefit i see you havent changed much no regard for the feelings of women
th thats uncalled for i meant nothing by it 
oh but i still remember how you abandoned lady lachesis left her to go off on her own the sorrow was plain as day upon her face but you let her walk away
i  im not sure what you mean 
no i know you understand sir finn but you pretend not to
 selphina weve just met again for the first time in a decade theres no need to get into this now
ah  i apologize youve the right of it it was more than rude of me to ambush you like that after such a long absence 
no i  i understand we can  talk about it later for now the battlefield calls
 of course sir finn
lady selphina i made it back
oh my dear carrion thank you for all that youve done
think nothing of it milady would that i couldve done more  ah i must double my training if im to become as strong a knight as sir glade sometime in my natural life i want only to aid prince leif but all ive learned in his service so far is just how powerless i truly am 
dont let your impatience cloud your judgment you wont be of any use to him dead hmm  the time to grant you your inheritance may have come more quickly than id thought
inheritance th this is  a fine blade milady but where 
your mother entrusted this to me its known as the elite sword she bade me give it to you when you had grown into a worthy knight
m mother
she passed from this world far too young taken by illness a tragedy if ever there was one that  this very blade was a favorite of your fathers and he wielded it right up until the day he died honorably in battle
f fathers own blade  that he wielded in service of house leonster 
this is your birthright carrion use it with great care
y yes i will thank you lady selphina
what the bandits have yet to fall signal the armored lances to charge
what have you idiots been doing all forces move to engage the bandits i want them dead even if you have to throw yourselves on their swords
y youre no common bandit whats going on here
f forgive me king travant your majesty 
prince leif ive dire news i  i regret to report that the villa  has fallen
come again th then  duke dryas 
all that remained of leonsters nobility had taken refuge here  now they have joined their kingdom in oblivion without them im afraid there is  no longer any hope of reconstituting leonster 
dryas
prince leif  to be able to see you safe and healthy after all these years  youve  grown into quite the splendid young man
whatever ive accomplished i owe to you and finn without your sacrifices i never couldve come as far as i have 
 oh this is most unbecoming confound it  i  i ah  i suppose ive become easier to move to tears in my age
 duke dryas i think youve earned  ah y your arm dont tell me you 
oh this bah its but a trifle i  grew careless during the battle for ulster the disgrace is mine alone to bear
at ulster then  it was for the sake of ensuring my escape  dammit is that what it always comes down to how many more people have to sacrifice themselves just to save me how many even you dryas  all for me 
hah dont let this of all things weigh heavily upon your heart prince leif even supposing i wasnt injured an old dotard like me would hardly be of any use to you now let us not allow our minds to linger on past wounds weve much work to do yet i understand you wish to aid tarrah i mean to do the same but weve precious little time to act ive sent glade ahead to the city weve gotten word back from him and he reports that the empire means to mount an all out assault against tarrah perilously soon with you and your forces here every brave soul in thracia now stands assembled beneath the banner of njorun the reborn kingdom of leonster must be unleashed upon the front lines starting with the thracian soldiers amassed outside
regarding that  the thracian troops seem to have ceased attacking most curious 
outright suspicious even
ill start coming up with a plan give me a moment to get a better look at this strange state of affairs prince leif
hmm  leifs man was right they have indeed called off their attack  but why  who in blazes is that that dracoknight a woman by the look of it whats she saying to the thracian troops some kind of declaration
all soldiers of thracia heed me this is your princess altena i bring word from general hannibal himself the men in that villa are not bandits theyre a mercenary unit the general has stationed here to protect this area from bandits sheathe your swords withdraw at once
/***EOF***/
the grannvale empire which lay to the west
yet finn proved stronger than those who hunted them and the three made their way to the cities of ulster and tarrah posing as common vagrants eventually they drifted into fiana a small village on thracias eastern coast fiana was an independent community with its own militia the freeblades of fiana led by the swordswoman eyvel eyvel welcomed leifs group as if they were her own kin under her watchful eye the deposed prince spent his childhood in fiana growing into maturity alongside youths of common birth now in year 776 of the grannvale calendar 
have you found that whelp of a prince yet
regretfully not milord the men have searched the village top to bottom but came up with nothing
why is such a simple task taking you so long theres little doubt that the heir to house leonster is hiding here youve been too gentle with these villagers give them ample motivation to talk
we are of the same mind milord ive already ordered the men to do as much yet the townsfolk claim the prince isnt here according to them he left with the freeblades to fend off a pirate raid on a nearby village
freeblades what nonsense is that
theyre the local militia sire as i understand it this village was once home to a group of brigands rather savage ones at that about a decade ago they were routed by eyvel a wandering sellsword she claimed the village as her own and founded the freeblades to protect the region from future attacks shes supposedly quite a wonder with a sword 
hmm  she may be a problem
you have nothing to fear milord weve taken eyvels daughter captive whats more we also captured the daughter of finn the very knight guarding the princes life with the leverage we have over them theyll have no choice but to surrender
hmph i admit you have your uses weissman the women will accompany me back to munster youll remain here and prepare for when these upstart rebels return see that the young leonster pup is put in chains befitting a stray mutt
your trust in me is well placed sire men bring the girls here
whats your name lass
hmph 
hah a fighting spirit to match a pretty face now lets have a look at the other one  ah you must be finns young ward i hear your mother was royalty of house nordion is that right you certainly dont lack for grace despite living in this backwater hovel holy blood doesnt run thin even in squalor i see
  
what a pleasant surprise the two of you make for weissman ill be departing for munster now dont disappoint me
all shall be as you wish it milord
whats that commotion in the village somethings rotten here 
ill scout ahead commander hold here a moment
commander fiana is packed to the brim with imperial troops they  must have struck while we were away
what no way is the empire gonna make a mess of our home commander lets move in
calm down osian well get slaughtered if we just charge in blindly
yeah halvan im sure the village will appreciate your patient attitude while everyones being rounded up and jailed
peace osian halvan is right seems weve finally been noticed by the empire looks like this is goodbye little leif im sorry finn take him as far away from here as you can leave the soldiers to us
no commander nanna is still in the village i wont leave without her
ill get her back dont worry
its more than that commander  i wont run anymore thats my decision to make
 finn you wanna weigh in here you going to let the little lord throw himself into harms way like this
lord leif has seen the passing of 15 summers by now hes old enough to choose for himself and as my liege i will abide by his judgment
has it been that long already hmph i suppose i let little leif come with us to fight off those pirates myself  guess i made up my own mind when i did that if finns all right with it so am i
then whats the hold up if were done arguing theres an invasion happening over that ridge
all right get ready to move in but stay sharp most foot soldiers are just regular folk forced into the imperial army against their will if they surrender just take their weapons and let them go are we clear
but we can still bloody them until they surrender right i mean if we cant put up a good fight ourselves well be the ones surrendering
knock em around if you have to sure but dont overdo it that means you osian
hey cmon gimme some credit commander
ok enough chatter lets give the empire a battle worthy of our names as freeblades
papa the fightings started already
aint no good way to go about this damned battle  dont matter how good eyvel is theres only one of her an over a dozen of them we need to hurry
oh fer cryin out loud not again 
dagdar you  came down to fight with us
eyvel does me heart good to see you in one piece listen ya have any idea why the empire would come all the way out here it have anything to do with  the boy
yeah the little lord leif hes  hes not just some nobleman hes the heir to house leonster ive been helping him hide from the empire im sorry  i shouldnt have kept it from you
mm i figured as much well no use worryin about it now long as i get to cut down some of those imperial dastards meself were even
tanya what do you think youre doing here
what does it look like osian im here to help you guys any way i can
help any way you can huh in that case turn tail and march back home thats the only way a kid like you could help youd just get in the way
youve got some nerve osian youre just a kid yourself you know you want me gone im gone not all of us are as eager to throw ourselves into danger as you
those imperial dogs took dame mareeta and lady nanna just snatched em right up like they was cattle youre not gonna let em get away with that are you if youre fixin to fight the empire take this with you this here rings enchanted with some spell or another but dont just wear it on your finger like some common bauble you gotta actually use it for it to do any good
yall made it back what a relief  but look theres no freeblades of fiana without fiana right so dont just stop with them pirates drive the empire from our village too   not to imply that i aint grateful a course take this with you use it if you get scraped up we dont have much in the way of medicine but its the least we can do after everythin the commanders done fer us
weapons can be mighty expensive cant they most folk here gotta make do by nicking supplies from imperial troops its awful risky but if you can capture an enemy alive you get to help yourself to their stuff matter of fact i got the drop on an imperial soldier myself heard im snoring from three houses way so i took me a souvenir   not that itll do me much good though probably better off in your hands i reckon and hey if you dont need it you can just hawk it for somethin you do need
big brother ive got something real special for you you can use this to keep yourself safe right
an  axe where in the world did you get such a fine weapon
darnedest thing  i was walkin past the lake up on the mountain when this strange ol crone just floated outta the water she gave it to me then vanished quick as you can blink i been keepin it for you and takin real good care of it now go put it to use an make me proud
hey hey have you seen my big brother halvan hes got me awful scared  i hope hes all right 
you pullin your weight in the freeblades boy last thing commander eyvel needs is to babysit you
were risking life and limb to protect the village and youre giving me a lecture youve got a strange sense of gratitude old man
not even the empire knockin down our front door can stop that fool mouth of yours i see well no point in draggin this out here this is what you came for right
for once you read my mind when a fight breaks out i just feel off without this axe at my side
which dont explain why you forget it at home half the damn time
hey i came here for the axe not to get chewed out
if thats all you wanted then get going go on now dont keep the commander waitin on you
you dont need to tell me twice
where has that fool boy of mine gone off to in this fracas i swear my osians gonna get himself killed one of these days 
do you fools realize what youre doing if i die so do the women we took
d damn  youll  love to regret this all of you 
damn  bested by a bunch of backwoods yokels well i wont forget this
nanna mareeta where are you please answer me
little nan mareeta  raydrik mustve taken em
what that means  they were taken to munster right
yeah as bargaining chips in case weissman couldnt finish the job its the sort of thing raydrik would pull allright
gods breath  commander we have to give chase the two of them are counting on us
now look here little leif 
commander you yourself said im not a child anymore nanna and mareeta were taken captive because of me and i refuse to let anyone suffer in my place i will never again let someone sacrifice their life in exchange for mine
 i understand we leave at dawn then i wont lie little lord this is gonna get rough get some rest while you can
nanna mareeta where are you please answer me
l lord leif gods breath are you a sight fer sore eyes i  wish i had better news fer you they came fer lady nanna they did and we couldnt do nuthin to stop em
nanna what happened to nanna
the empire took er sure as youre standin here mareeta tried to break her loose but only got captured erself they both wore chains last i saw
where were they taken
dont rightfully know lord leif one of them soldiers said somethin about headin back to munster but nuthin more specificn that
munster  then thats where im headed too ill bring everyone home nanna mareeta and the commander
/***EOF***/
the gates stood atop high cliffs and were defended by vast numbers of ballistae it was painfully clear that seizing the gates would be anything but simple 
my prince may i present your sovereign land castle leonster is in sight were approaching from the rear gate so the enemy shouldnt be expecting us
im not sure it will be so easy august the cliffs to the east are impassable and if we go around them and head west the ballistae will have a clear shot at us what are we to do
indeed  i admit i didnt foresee the enemy preparing so many ballistae yet if we go about things too slowly well lose the element of surprise and enemy reinforcements will overwhelm us ah this is most vexing 
dorias what would you suggest
at the very least our goal is simple our army wont be able to advance as long as those damned ballistae are there as for how to eliminate them we could either send in mages or use aerial units to attack from above either way well likely suffer a few losses we need to prepare ourselves for that
i understand but keep thinking there may yet be a better way
general amalda how is it a fine soldier like you got stuck guarding the rear gate
evidently my comments touched a nerve with marquess gustav 
still bickering about the child hunts i take it
its more than a simple row gustav is seizing children from the nearby villages despite having no order from the king to do so its obvious hes trying to curry favor with the loptian order handing over innocent children like little presents could you forgive such a thing if you were in my position
now now lady amalda just take a breath i understand how you feel but remember the child hunts were instituted by emperor arvis himself so sooner or later regardless of how vocally you oppose it all the local children will be seized and taken to belhalla
but why why is all this happening i believed in emperor arvis i longed to become a knight in his service  how did he go so wrong
youre with the leonster army arent you wheres lord leif
ah lord leif  welcome home the people of leonster have long awaited this day 
youre the village elder i take it i cant imagine how your people must have suffered over these long years  im sorry for everything youve been through but that all ends today ill personally be leading the knights of leonster into battle to recapture the castle believe in our victory leonster shall rise again
prince theres something i must ask of you let us help you reach the castle please
help us  you mean your people wish to fight
indeed well not bear the abuses of the empire for one moment longer we always knew the day would come to liberate the motherland and weve been stockpiling weapons in secret
with respect elder there are numerous ballistae positioned in the castle grounds your poorly armed militia will be easy pickings for them
i know that i dont expect any of us to make it back alive all we could do is be the princes shield but we would do it gladly we can attract the ballistaes attention and lure them away from your forces while we keep them busy the prince can breach the 
out of the question whats the point of winning back my country if i sacrifice my people to do it i wont allow such a thing
lord leif  do you have any idea just how much pain weve endured over these past ten years marquess gustav took our women the loptian order took our children the few who tried to resist were killed in the most brutal ways imaginable and then their families were killed too as an example my prince my sovereign lord  this is the only home weve ever known simple folk like us cant live without our home so if it means regaining that home well do whatever it takes we offer you our lives and we have no regrets
elder sir 
prince leif  when a country falls to ruin its people fall to ruin as well for what life awaits those left behind without a home they speak with the same tawdry devotion one would expect from a knight and like a knight they seem utterly resigned to die even after years of oppression theyre still consumed by this childish sentimentality and if theyre so set in their ways 
you  august you mean to say i should accept their offer
im merely saying its worth considering you wanted a better way to seize the castle did you not this may very well be it
 dorias what say you
i can only imagine how the villagers must feel but even so i cannot condone this regardless the choice is yours to make prince leif what is your command
oh ho so youre attackin castle leonster well lemme bend yer ear for a second  see it just so happens that ive cooked up a little scheme to get past the eastern gate my boys can have that thing wide open in two shakes of a lambs tail so how bout it feel like taking a shortcut wont be free a course nothin is but you pile up an even 20000 gold in front of me an well call it a deal what does it sound too expensive well we aint stupid well be the ones putting our lives on the line so  whats it gonna be
what kind of conqueror doesnt have a full wallet ugh just see yourself out
been waitin for ya i heard the whole story from the boss well  good luck i guess
youll never reclaim your damn castle just give up
castle friege  is so very far 
i cant live a soldiers life any longer  i suppose ill return home 
i  what in blazes am i doing 
fitting  a life lived steeped in blood can only end with more blood 
am i doomed to watch this nightmare continue 
weve finally seized the castle gates but we dont know what awaits us inside  august lets hear the intelligence youve gathered
ahem  the castles commander is a man named gustav a close associate of king bloom he is  a man of many vices
marquess gustav  for the past decade hes ruled leonster with an iron fist
frankly hes a second rate commander but he makes up for it by lavishing his troops with expensive equipment
anything else we should be aware of
well the real problem will be general xavier his skills on the battlefield are quite renowned and he commands a battalion of heavily armored knights
xavier ngh  a thousand deaths wont be enough for that traitor
i  take it you know him dorias
hah  as ashamed as i am to admit it xavier was once an esteemed general of leonster he was known for his sense of justice and had everyones utmost trust but the instant leonster fell he betrayed us and defected to the invaders the shameless cur  i cannot forgive him no force in all the heavens will keep my blade from his throat
its not what you think duke dorias
youre  the village elder what are you talking about do you mean to protect that damnable turncoat
general xavier did everything for our sake he joined the invaders out of necessity to help guarantee our safety leonster was in chaos after being defeated and we common folk were abandoned left to the enemys mercy the general showed us pity and traded his own honor for our lives had he not intervened myself and all the other villagers wouldnt be alive today
is this true no it cant be the prince has returned yet he still serves the empire if he and his men would just turn against them the castle would be as good as ours
bah would that things were that simple  you see the general has eight adjutants theyre as close as kin and theyve shouldered lifes burdens together the wives and children of these eight adjutants are being held hostage inside the castle and despite being their superior the general hasnt the heart to act without the consent of his men say what you will but he cares deeply for their well being 
then our plan is obvious if we rescue the hostages the general and his men will be freed of their servitude
you  think it will be that easy
he deserves an apology for everything hes been through  as the last living heir to house leonster i owe him that much
/***EOF***/
bishop oltof listen closely these attackers are none other than the motley survivors of house leonster they seem to be led by leif the rebel prince who caused a stir when he escaped from the dungeons of castle munster this has escalated beyond a mere border skirmish i must ride for belhalla at once and alert the imperial armys high command not to imply that this relieves you of your duties of course i still have orders for you and your men your platoon is to barricade itself inside this wing of the fortress and stall the rebels for as long as possible buy me time
b but general the enemy has already breached the forts interior my men and i cannot possibly withstand a prolonged siege
nonsense you still have one final means of defense the balistrariae
 you want us to huddle behind those gaps in the walls and take potshots at the invaders y youre asking us to die 
no im ordering you to kill the invaders before they kill you theres a tremendous difference mind you no part of my orders require you to die in fact if you die you have only yourself to blame oh and im not asking anything you used that word not i these are orders
i  understand if  if this is an order i have no choice in the matter
thats the first smart thing youve said bishop take your own advice and follow my orders otherwise youll be keeping olwen company in the dungeon ah speaking of which you mustnt forget to dispose of the prisoners theyll only cause trouble if they manage to survive all this
 as you wish general
dont look so glum bishop if you should happen to die here you can rest knowing your death served a purpose
  
y yer an imperial soldier  you low down no good wench all you do is go around spreadin misery to other folk an now yer here to kill us aintcha
no thats  thats not why im here i was arrested wh what are you kids doing here
s soldiers were raidin our village  they took me an brought me here even when i kicked an screamed  wh whats gonna happen to us 
yer talkin like they aint already decided what to do with us theyre gonna sacrifice us to loptous theyre gonna send us to belhalla an kill every last one of us  i know cuz my sister got taken there an she never came back
no p please dont take us away i jus wanna go back home  i jus wanna see mama and papa again 
it cant be  has the empire really been conducting child hunts id heard rumors but  i was sure it was just rebel propaganda i never even considered that it could be true  for the empire to be doing something so heinous  this is inexcusable i believed in the empire i trusted in house friege  and this is what theyve been doing all along
please maam help us take us back home
 everythings going to be all right you dont have to worry anymore little one they wont lay a finger on you ever again on my honor ill protect each and every one of you even if it costs me my life 
lady olwen are you down here please say something
fred you came back for me  im over here and children have been locked up in here too but kempf still has men stationed here dont get careless
hmph orders be damned ill not just sit here and wait to die men can all of you truly go along with this knowing what i was told by the general i must be off ill report how dire our situation is to the general or to whatever commanding officer still remains here
if thats the case bishop perhaps i 
no ill go it has to be me you understand i entrust you with this units command the rest is in your hands
  
i can see you protected those children during the battle  may i ask who you are
i would ask the same of you sir
 my name is leif and i command this army
leif so youre prince leif of house leonster are you not i  i am olwen mage knight of house friege at your service
house friege you say then  why did you 
frankly im not sure where to begin its quite the long story  ive  come to learn a number of terrible truths in a very short time and my mind is in disarray  prince leif if you can forgive my choice of allegiance i would ask to stay in your company for a time just while i come to terms with what ive learned i assure you
your past is of no issue to me however i must consult my advisors august and dryas on this matter youll have to wait until this battle is over before i can render judgment on your request
of course it was unreasonable of me to ask such a thing of you so suddenly  i apologize
lady olwen
fred thank you  youve saved me from a fate most terrible
think nothing of it milady im just glad youre safe now we must move quickly if were to escape  hm whats come over you youre white as a sheet
fred  what have we really been fighting for
what do you mean milady
what exactly have i accomplished how many children have been stolen from their families under my watch how many caravans of children have i helped send to belhalla how many  how many sacrifices to loptous have i made possible
lady olwen 
never before have i had such  doubts  about what ive done i believed that as long as i followed my brother there could be no questioning the righteousness of my path but now  now im as blind as a newborn i cant be certain of anything i have nothing to believe in i  i dont know what to do 
 lady olwen i can tell you only one thing for certain your place isnt with the empire and its army not anymore but perhaps there could be a place for us in prince leifs army
join prince leif h hes the enemy he always has been
 i met prince leif albeit briefly just from what little i saw his values are far more in line with ours than the empires are whatever it is youve lost sight of lady olwen we can find it again in his army
 if youre that convinced of prince leifs honor fred then thats where well go
fred ive decided to join these people im a defector youre no longer bound to me by military code youre free to do as you please 
not another word lady olwen once your adjutant always your adjutant if milady has decided that this is the best course of action then i shall gladly follow
fred  thank you
youll go no further i  ill be the one to make it out of this i will
g glory to house friege 
t this is house leonsters idea of waging war  i  i may have been mistaken about you 
yet more children caged  its easy to see why the people of tarrah rebelled
indeed but that makes the empire all the more desperate to make an example of tarrah and stamp out their uprising supposing they allowed tarrah to defy them countless cities would follow suit its for this very reason that the empire has summoned troops from across jugdral just to attack one city they move to crush both tarrah and its hopes all at once ive even heard tell that the gelben ritter have been recalled from belhalla to join in the assault
the gelben ritter  thats house frieges elite battalion of knights correct
indeed but they are no mere knights theyre mage knights each of them handpicked for the job and each of them a noble from house frieges inner circle theyre one of the strongest if not the strongest battalions of knights in the continent to make matters worse theyre led by none other than princess ishtar the woman widely feared as the goddess of thunder and her adjutant sir reinhardt is a damned fine warrior in his own right some even believe him to be the reincarnation of the crusader thrud
a man who readily lends his hand to child hunting is what you call a damned fine warrior how typical  knights are so hopeless youve lost sight of reality
august you insult me speaking so brashly just what is it that im unaware of please do tell
need i spell it out reinhardt is ishtars adjutant and guardian ishtar is the betrothed of crown prince julius julius the very same man the people call the scion of darkness need i remind you is the vessel of the dark god loptous ultimately anyone who serves julius in any way is ushering the world closer to destruction
its not like that at all my brother  my lord brother reinhardt is no servant of loptous
 and who might you be
olwen sister of sir reinhardt
for her own reasons she wishes to accompany our army i gave her leave to do so unless you have objections
 i see if thats the case olwen take a good hard look at what the empire has done here see them for what they truly are
/***EOF***/
munster was once the sovereign land of house leonster it was now governed by house friege who had personally been installed as rulers by the emperor of grannvale after his conquest of north thracia raydrik himself had once been a general of the kingdom of conote but colluded with the empire during the war for that service he was made baron of munster while still subordinate to lord bloom head of house friege raydrik was entrusted with the day to day management of munster leif would now see firsthand what life was like in his familys former home 
hahaha without a doubt this feat will secure my position in munster and beyond dalsin see that the brat doesnt so much as blink before the knights of conote come to claim him

wait just a darn minute you were the one who started it
yeah an they arrested me cause they thought i helped you nearly kill that guy this is on you not me so whatre you gonna do about it
im gonna take a nap thats what hey you gotta learn to take the good with the bad you know just wake me when its mealtime
ugh i dont even care anymore  oh uh sorry im karin by the way
karin thats an unusual name for a thracian
thats cause im not thracian im from silesse id just gotten into town when i got in trouble thanks to this dimwit
silesse  thats far north of here if memory serves why come all the way here from silesse
our prince up and left the country thats why the queen passed away an the princess is too young to take the throne so people dont know who to turn to i came here to look for our little runaway prince
id heard that the kingdom of silesse had been overthrown by the empire how is it the royal family is still alive
the rebels have been keeping them safe everyone still willing to fight has gathered in the city of thove where theyve rallied around the royal family me im gonna become a pegasus knight an lend them my lance
impressive if you become a pegasus knight youll be able to dance through the skies
well i can fly already but i wont be doing aerial acrobatics like a knight any time soon still my pegasus an me can already understand each other really well his names hermes an hes just the cutest thing you ever saw with a brain to match hes probably the one dancing through the skies right now looking for me that is
so why did the prince leave silesse in the first place
its a long story the prince wanted to go look for the king but the kings somethin of a flake himself he also left silesse years ago abandonin his kingdom and family both everybody feels betrayed an nobody expects the king to come back anymore so we want prince ced to come back instead an take the throne i was sent here to meet with him but ended up jailed cause of this muttonhead
hm what about mutton is it mealtime already  oh guess not cant you keep it down until then at least this is a prison fer cryin out loud its not like anyone can escape all yer yammerin
and its not like anyone can escape your loud snoring either honestly how can you sleep at a time like this you are the most boorish insensitive 
hey keep it down you twits
see even the empire agrees with me bahaha 
tch 
  
whats eatin you lad you look awful upset might as well speak yer mind eh not like it could do any harm now
 youre right in fact maybe you two can even help me

you got the skill with a blade to back up them words lass
i  wont pretend im the best but ill give it my all
yeah didnt think so ah geez  thats two kids i gotta look out for now 
w what the empire tried to take me own kin in their damned child hunts i was  i was only goin along with em cause they promised my family would be spared tch  damn raydrik and damn the empire ive no love left for any of em i defect me life is in yer hands
i take no pleasure in this  you lot shoulda stayed in yer cells
d damn  jubel  live a long and happy life with yer sister 
they got heart ill give em that  i owe em somethin at least
veld how go your operations here
smoothly archbishop manfroy some of the citizens mount a meager resistance but their children are harvested all the same
splendid then tarrah is the only city not under our influence if they remain disagreeable make an example of them burn the city and its people show munster that the empire does not tolerate resistance
it would be done your eminence but the generals of house friege seem to have lost their nerve theyve surrounded the city but have yet to act
princess ishtar your father appears to be openly defying the direct orders of the crown surely you have an explanation for this lack of resolve
my father has been placed in a difficult position many of our own as well as the clergy are vehemently opposed to the practice of  child hunts my own brother is among the dissidents and i stand with him archbishop manfroy on behalf of my family i must ask that you stop this savagery abducting children too young to lift a sword separating them from their families its simply unconscionable but you dont stop there do you no  you take these innocent souls and sacrifice them to your dark god have you no shame
ishtar my beloved theres been a terrible misunderstanding never would i condone the slaughter of children do you truly believe me capable of such a thing i merely want them to be trained and educated  sculpted into adults worthy to inhabit the empire the ones who survive our rigorous training will become a new kind of ruling class one that will govern over all others of common birth consider it these children of peasants are given a chance to earn nobility even happiness for themselves
at what cost they compete against each other learn to hate each other struggle to survive without their families  you dare call that happiness
 ah my dear youll understand my wisdom your betrotheds wisdom one day im sure say theres a beautiful bed of flowers just out back lets take in the view together ishtar
 lord julius 
/***EOF***/
fort dandrum widely regarded as an impregnable defense against thracian incursions now stood before them if they could not capture fort dandrum the army would never reach tarrah in time 
ive already told you the enemy appeared out of nowhere to attack fort noel if you dont send reinforcements general largo is as good as dead just say the word and ill lead our troops to stomp out these invaders please general kempf 
you claim this enemy appeared out of nowhere to besiege fort noel but who exactly were they remind me what was your assignment again im just a lowly general of house friege and these little details escape me all the time ah wait its coming back to me reconnaissance wasnt it im fairly certain that was it but that doesnt make sense  if your duty was reconnaissance surely youd come to me with more than they just appeared so either my memory has failed me or youre such an incompetent soldier that you failed to gather even the slightest bit of information
i came here to warn you precisely because there was no time to do anything else listen to yourself youre badgering me for needless details while our borders are under siege does it matter who the attackers are
and what if this attack is merely a ploy to lure us away from the fort did you consider that girlie fort dandrum earned its reputation of being impregnable only because house frieges 12th battalion is here to guard it without them the fort is mere stone and slate if i dont have complete information on our enemy i cant chance deploying the 12th battalion it would weaken our position
and what of general largo perhaps sending the battalion out is a risk but he faces certain danger at this very moment
bah whats one or two old men in the grand scheme of things besides how much time could he really have left anyway
wh what general kempf even now you  you 
the glare youre shooting me is almost treasonous on its own ive had men executed for much less brazen displays of disrespect so before you back up that glare with equally traitorous words let me warn you youre very close to insulting the chain of command are you truly willing to defy your superior officer its amusing watching you squirm i admit but exercise some reason are you really up to the task knowing what the empire does to traitors
tch 
is that it youve got quite the mouth on you but no spine to back up your words
  
youre a simple girl who got into belhallas military academy on the prestige of her blood not the skill of her sword arm so naïve so oblivious to the way of the world  youre lucky to have a commanding officer as understanding as i dont worry i never expected much of you i know that your only real weapon is to go begging your brother for help
wh what did you just say to me
hm are you hard of hearing i said that all youre good for is to go crying to reinhardt
you 
oh how he must dote on you  then again reinhardts greatest skill is knowing how to lead women on
hold your tongue ill not stand here and let you dishonor my brother this is unforgivable  have at you
hah you dare to draw your sword on me you feeble minded wench men seize olwen and throw her in the dungeon for this act of rebellion
yes general lady olwen in the name of the empire youre under arrest drop your weapon
tch  general kempf  how contemptible 
hah that should put the impertinent little girl in her place and if his own sister is executed for mutiny reinhardt will no doubt be stripped of his rank as well oh the look on his face when he hears of this will be quite the spectacle ahahaha
general kempf explain yourself
fred my dear boy you look different from your usual self is something amiss
dont play dumb why have you done this to lady olwen its a violation of our military code to punish a subordinate over a personal grudge like this you have a responsibility to overturn this please sir release her at once otherwise i have no choice but to report this matter to princess ishtar
personal grudge nonsense right where youre standing lady olwen drew her sword against me her superior officer she meant to kill me
wh what thats not possible she  she would never 
fred since youre so well acquainted with our military code whats the punishment for turning your sword against a superior officer because i seem to recall that its a crime punishable by execution 
 so thats your goal is it your cowardice knows no bounds 
be that as it may as olwens adjutant her duties now fall to you i command you to ride forth and engage these invaders in her place but be warned this isnt merely an order its a punishment you are not permitted to retreat for any reason see the battle through regardless of the outcome or ill have olwen executed
kempf  youre shameless
hm did you say something eh mustve just been my imagination heh heh heh 
whats this  the enemy flies the twin banners of njörun and house leonster are they being led by  a boy why he cant be more than 14 or 15 ive got swords that are older than him ah i see  that must be the wayward prince leif first olwen and now prince leif marches right up to my doorstep the gods are most generous today this is my chance all hands hear me ive a plan for just such an occasion as this but for it to work you must lure the enemy inside and dont be too obvious about it prepare to launch operation portcullis
ahahaha those dullards actually fell for it all right men fire at will
do the holy blooded knights of house friege fight using such underhanded tactics when our forces met in noel valley i respected the honor with which your army conducted itself it seems i was mistaken
 on behalf of my home my honor compels me to agree with you the crusader thrud would not have fought using such treachery this is all because of that fool of a man general kempf  this disgrace is his doing as a knight im loath to give my life in service of such a foul plan you seem to be an honorable lad ive self control enough to not turn my sword against you if you can promise the same
 if youve no mind to fight sir then we have no reason to meddle with you in fact we may even be able to help each other id wager the both of us have little energy to spare now
i  can agree to those terms ive many things left undone  its settled then we can both agree that our time is better spent devising an escape
very well my forces will storm the castles interior in short order when that happens you should make your escape to the south we can take care of the gate ourselves are we in agreement
we are it appears i owe you quite the debt  im fred proud knight of house schutaeze i would know your name as well friend
 its leif leif of house leonster
house leonster i  i see  well lord leif i believe well meet again one of these days
youd turn your blade on me in this situation what idiocy
olwen  i tried to save you  f forgive me 
tch  so much for the impregnable fort dandrum 
tch  so much for the impregnable fort dandrum 
ugh  what a joke  i must flee this place at least for the time being 
simply superb work my prince with fort dandrum captured this quickly it will be all but impossible for the enemy to escape we cannot afford to rest on our laurels however this being an imperial fort i expect there are children imprisoned here as well weve bought ourselves some time with our swift victory lets make the most of it and conduct a sweep of the interior if indeed there are children locked up here we must help them at once
fort dandrum has fallen and not a moment too soon weve little time to spare still better to seize a fort slowly than to incur massive casualties doing so quickly theres nothing left for us here fort dandrum no longer has any strategic value ignore any enemies already in retreat we must make for tarrah on the double
/***EOF***/
the freeblades of fiana and the magi wished to make for castle munster and liberate it first while the nobles of leonster and the sellswords of tarrah favored liberating castle leonster first ultimately pragmatism prevailed as it was agreed that seizing leonster first was more advantageous to the armys mobility however as they neared solwood pass leif would soon have to make another strategic decision 
prince leif a moment if i may i would advise heading west at solwood pass to reach the road to nordrhein
and it is on this matter that duke dryas and i are of different minds i instead argue heading east at the pass that route will allow us to attack leonster from the south where the empires defenses are sure to be weaker
clearly you arent well acquainted with the area if you were youd know that millefeuille forest lies to leonsters south the place is synonymous with folk getting lost and never returning hell the locals even call it mirage forest for short
dont patronize me im well aware of the dangers but so is the empire they wont be expecting an attack to come from such a treacherous area with our smaller numbers making clever use of the terrain is our only hope of victory thats just basic tactics
i must strenuously object all of thracia no all of jugdral is watching our battle this is about more than victory we cannot merely win we must win in such a way that gives inspiration and hope to the masses oppressed by the empire are we to skulk through the woods like common bandits nay we have to make a glorious spectacle of it charging into battle with leonsters flag held high
such a spectacle would indeed be glorious for the empire wed be charging right into their front lines our casualties would be enormous
some of our own would perish true but it would be an honorable death worthy of a knight of leonster
dont presume to speak for all of us duke dryas only a small fraction of our troops are knights many more hold no title to them your notion of an honorable death is something neither meaningful nor desirable see that you dont get innocent men killed by projecting your own values onto them
th thats uncalled for august your very words come perilously close to an insult sigh though i suppose theres little point to us arguing further the decision rests with prince leif now
 indeed it does we shall do as the prince commands
boss boss i gots a great idea lets hit up that there village today
what that old slum its just a couple lean tos and an outhouse they dont got nuthin worth stealin heh burnin the place down might actually be an improvement fer them villagers
they might not got anything valuable but they do got girls real pretty girls we could just snatch em up and sell em to slavers itd be an easy payday
huh  you might be onto something youngun all right lets do it move out boys round up all the ladyfolk and kill everybody else
it was good seeing you bishop though i wish it were under better circumstances youll watch over the children i trust
of course milady theyll be most safe here the empire has no reason to come all this way through the mountains for one poor village truth be told im most glad to dedicate my final years to raising these children but what of you lady amalda will you be all right if the empire learns of what youve done here i shudder to think of what terrible fate would befall you 
i feel no fear only shame shame that even as a proud knight of house friege i can only help these children in secret with each passing day more and more are taken captive and sent to belhalla  i can only save but a handful each time his majesty grants me an audience i try to convince him that going along with these child hunts is a grave mistake but time and time again he simply refuses to listen to reason  and now im in command of a whole battalion  how can i lead my men when i dont even believe in our orders myself
im quite familiar with how you must feel lady amalda but you mustnt let yourself get careless
father sleuf i cant just 
without you wed have no way of helping the captive children at all wed be reduced from rescuing a handful to rescuing none think of how many more lives we have yet to save before throwing your own away
 youre right thank you for your counsel father sleuf ill do as you advise
she walks a hard road that one would that our own was any easier 
yet for all that we do the world is still crumbling to pieces all around us we can do naught but pray as it collapses 
perhaps  but i know what i heard at the tower of bragi when the three lights converge as one darkness shall be banished from the living world
the voice of father claud long since dead and buried 
im sure it was him he asked a service of me saying o righteous man servant of bragi do what i cannot be my eyes look upon your world and tell me what it has become
mm  i understand youre meant for greater things than raising a few toddlers in a remote village go embark on this journey the gods have charged you with worry not ill care for the children
thank you bishop  please forgive my selfishness im deeply sorry i cannot stay 
bishop we got a big problem on our hands a pack of bandits are closing in on the village
h how can that be we have nothing of value
guess they got their reasons cause i just saw em headed this way with my own two eyes that woman you were talking with the knight she says shes gonna help fight em off but with just the two of us i dunno how long we can hold em back youd best take all the women and children an hightail it outta here
will the gods grant us no respite bah very well ralf ill do as you say you have my apologies  a sellsword defending a poor village for no pay  youre proof that not all good has vanished from the world we all thank you
heh  i never run from a fight bishop no matter what
are you a sellsword hired by the village
depends what you mean im fighting for the village but i sure dont remember gettin paid by em not that i woulda taken their gold even if they had offered me any couldnt take coin from the needy
then why fight on their behalf
i stumbled across this place in the middle of my own little journey and they lent me a hand time to return the favor thats all not that its any of your business ya little brat just who are you supposed to be anyway
ah my apologies i shouldnt have started prying without introducing myself first im leif of leonster
leif  h how  are you the leif the prince talk about being in the right place at the right time see im ralf an im not much more than a lowly sellsword myself if its all right with you prince could i join your army
of course we could always use more men like you though if i may id like to ask you something why exactly do you want to join my army whats your reason
because i wont put up with living under the empires thumb for one moment longer that good enough of a reason
i  cant say i disagree so that suffices for me yes ralf my greatest desire is to free every person suffering under the empires tyranny do you swear to fight for that cause
sure do leave it to me
wonders never cease  that band of soldiers has come to the villages rescue the gods may yet be merciful  now its high time i returned to my own soldiers
hold who are you another one of the empires lapdogs
how uncouth  if you wish to live turn your blade aside i didnt learn the technique of astra just to waste it on cutting down clueless little girls like you
astra b but thats the secret art of the isaachian royal family  that would make you 
correct it is i prince shannan of isaach but ive been forced to hide my identity so do us both a favor and forget you ever saw me
prince shannan i would ask something of you
hrk k keep your voice down would you lets avoid any surprises shall we
please you must teach me some of your swordplay i beg of you it doesnt have to be a prolonged lesson just knowing the secret of how to perform astra would be enough 
  
please prince shannan i want no i need to become stronger no matter what i must grow stronger 
w well i could take you through the motions i suppose 
would you oh id be in your debt
oof this has gone from bad to worse guess ill just ramble off some vague nonsense about swordsmanship 
knowing the movements of the technique is important of course but more important is your spirit your heart when the swiftness of your body becomes one with the sharpness of your mind only then are you capable of learning astra
my body and my mind 
indeed now to begin with make a simple swing with your sword
but how should i swing it exactly could you demonstrate just once
uhhh  n no that would defeat the whole point astra can only be mastered through your own attempts to understand it if i were to demonstrate it all you would learn is how to imitate me yeah that sounded good 
so thats how it is huh  all right ill just try something then hee yah
no not like that youre doing it completely wrong
haaa yah
no no now youre just flailing your sword around like youre blindfolded its about using your body and mind together remember your body is working but your mind isnt in it lady i am sellin you a bill of goods here 
focus my mind into my body  focus my mind into my body  haaa yah
w was that  i cant believe it 
 no way 
no that cant be it it isnt really that easy is it prince shannan
huh oh well uh  of course not my pupil you couldnt call that a perfected astra
thats what i thought i mean that hardly took any time at all 
a at any rate i promised to show you the motions and ive made good on my word ill be taking my leave now
thank you for everything prince shannan focus my mind into my body  focus my body into my mind 
maaan what was up with that girl
good heavens what a day this has been  ah youre the strangers that came to our villages aid are you not i wish to thank your leader personally where might they be
my goodness we owe you and your forces quite the debt  your decision to aid us is the only reason any of us still draw breath please accept this gift as a token of our gratitude
thank you bishop if youll excuse us my men and i must be on our way
where are you headed might i ask
we ride for leonster
is that so ive a favor to ask of you then a disciple of mine sleuf left here on  something of a personal journey if you happen to cross paths do send word that the lad is all right that said i offer to send you partway there with my warp staff i can teleport you to one of two places the first is millefeuille forest which is to the south of leonster be warned theres a reason it has the nickname mirage forest the second is nordrhein the coastline that runs east all the way to leonster but youd have to breach the fort the empire has there which way shall i send you
heheheh  you wanna square off with me do ya
ugh d damned  fools 
this way leads to nordrhein which will take us east along the coast to leonster seasoned imperial troops will be on the lookout for us i anticipate the battle will be a difficult one indeed is this your will sire
this path shall take us through the deep woodlands of millefeuille forest better known as the infamous mirage forest we would encounter little resistance but there may well be unforeseen hazards we have yet to discover shall we proceed my prince
/***EOF***/
the army would have to breach fort nordrhein an imperial base there house friege had deployed an elite battalion of soldiers determined to stop the liberation army in its path 
kempf for your sake i hope youre prepared for anything
leave everything to me colonel nicolov these rabble may have the gall to call themselves a liberation army but theyre no stronger than a pack of bandits my battalion shall shatter their delusions of grandeur with ease
with ease you say get your head on straight boy are you not the very man who abandoned his post and left his men to die at fort dandrum you scurried home with your tail between your legs brought shame to your uniform and you still have the audacity to be arrogant these men are the lanzenritter of leonster prince leif leads their vanguard and theyre within spitting distance of their motherland their morale is higher than the damn clouds underestimate them and youre as good as dead
ah  you  have my apologies colonel 
save it kempf just do as i say i need you and your battalion to stay on the bridge guard it with your life the ballistae in the rear will help hold your position no matter what dont move out of their range you got that its an order stick with the ballistae
 yes sir
now it may seem like were on the defensive but were just biding our time the real battle will begin when our reinforcements arrive when the knights of ulster get here well have the rebels surrounded from the front and back well trap them in a pincer attack and crush the enemy in one fell swoop
what the knights of ulster are to be our reinforcements
the very same count conomor is bringing nearly 100 men the rebels will be ambushed by the mightiest army in north thracia
i  see  so conomor is to get all the glory then no this wont do at all the rebels must die by my hands and mine alone
my prince the scout we sent ahead has returned he brings word of the enemys formation
hm  the perimeter of fort nordrhein is protected by ballistae  we wont be able to seize it without doing something about them
unfortunately that bridge is the only way across the river and its being defended by a battalion of heavily armored knights to make matters worse attacking the bridge would put us within range of the enemys ballistae
then our only option is to lure the knights out of the ballistaes range
i doubt any subterfuge would convince them to move far enough away they have a far superior position and they know it
perhaps but its still worth considering surely theres some way of tricking them away from the bridge 
leave that task to me lord leif i have  a history with their commander im certain i can lure him away from the bridge and his troops will be forced to follow
j just what are you proposing olwen i wont allow you to put yourself in such grave danger
then i ask it from you as a favor prince i want to help you just as you helped me
father sleuf seems a battle has broken out just outside an awfully big one at that its too dangerous for a man of the cloth youd best stay here a while longer itd be my pleasure to have you it would
very well loathe as i am to impose upon your kindness i suppose i dont have much of a choice 
damn it all  now im serving in that buffoons vanguard  where did i go so wrong are all commoners like me just doomed to be pawns of the nobility
all troops charge show the enemy the fury of ulster
lord conomor are you sure about this win or lose the motherland is already forfeit well never have another chance like this to retake alster
i know but if we betray the empire now i shudder to think what fate would befall princess miranda  the girl is just a lass of 15 years  shes much too young to die in some darkened monastery far from home 
hey hey over here pal uh sorry to butt in like this but can i bend your ear for a second
wh what who are you supposed to be look calm your pegasus down and stop fluttering around me like that
about that  i dont suppose youd lay down your sword and join up with us would you
h hey is this some kind of joke why the sudden olive branch gods above youre a strange one 
should i take that as a no then oh i shouldve known this would just be a waste of time  well goodbye i guess 
h hey wait a minute
hm what is it
i would uh  consider defecting if i could be promised certain conditions
really well now were gettin somewhere all right what is it you want
well assuming leonster is restored to its former glory id want full peerage and to receive a title of nobility
thats all well that should be an easy ask say if a noble title is all youre askin for wouldnt that make you just a commoner you must be a real hard worker to have made it into house frieges army i mean a commoner in house friege is like a pegasus flying with thracias dracoknights
commoner this commoner that  dont think you can label me so easily i may be a man of common birth but im not ashamed of it im proud that i was born into my family even if theres not a drop of noble blood in our veins
then why do you want a noble title so badly
ah  w well i  look i dont have to explain myself to you
uh huh  listen my names karin whats your name o noble commoner
oh uh  its ilios
thats an awfully noble sounding name  yknow the kind a stuffy aristocrat has to practice pronouncing is ilios even your real name
oh what a stupid thing to ask of course its my real name my father gave me such a name in the hope that i would one day earn a title to match
oh ho so another piece of the puzzle falls into place no wonder youre chasing after nobility so stubbornly when its literally stamped into your name look maybe it would be better to just change your name instead of diving head first into this whole quest for nobility thing besides you dont really look like an ilios like if i shouted ilios into a crowded room nobody would look at you no offense you look more like a  troy oh thats perfect that fits you much better dont you think
wh troy look you cant just go around messing with peoples birth names
well sir troy its good to have you fighting alongside us
h hey thats no fair
its been a long time general kempf how have you been
olwen hah i see your idiocy knows no bounds not content with a mutineers death you want to be hung as a traitor too
traitor i may be but my name will be remembered more fondly than yours look at yourself theres no fight left in you just false bravado your whole charade of arrogance is pathetic youre a failure and youre too much of a coward to admit it
what how dare you  i may have fled from fort dandrum but what of you you abandoned largo in nowell valley did you not bah you can add hypocrite to your litany of crimes
i ran to get reinforcements you just ran for your life i see you for what you are a coward when the going gets tough all you do is run you ran at fort dundrum and youre still running here cowering behind your troops and trembling like a child and just as you hide in the shadows here youll never escape the shadow of my lord brother reinhardt
hrk  you  youll die for those words men seize that woman kill her precious rebels kill all of them a lordship to whoever brings olwen to me alive ill choke the life out of you with my bare hands olwen you hear me
ive played my part  gods be with you lord leif
order a full charge on the enemys front lines ill give a pouch of gold for every rebel head stain the ground with their blood leave no one alive
h hold a moment general that goes against colonel nicolovs orders
and when we win the day no one will care besides nicolov is nothing nobody and im royalty dont you forget that all troops charge kill every last one of them
so the lanzenritter is alive and well  and just as fierce as their forefathers perhaps  perhaps we should withdraw just on this occasion weve misjudged the rebels strength knights of ulster im ordering a full retreat
ah you must be lord leif
thats right a priest back in solwood told me to keep an eye out for you but how did you recognize me
ive seen you before though not in person i was granted a vision at the tower of bragi its just as i foresaw  a boy bearing the twofold light  such great potential he carries  father claud  your words echo still and they only become truer as time goes on 
the tower of bragi twofold light what in blazes are you talking about
when the time comes milord understanding will dawn on you like a grand sunrise prince leif if it pleases you i would accompany you for a time
you you if you hadnt come this far 
i is this  a joke how could i  be bested  by them
hmph  i wont forget this remember me well for this is the face of your conqueror
rebel scum my blade shall be the one to cut you down
ugh  this isnt  the end 
ill be the laughing stock of the empire 
what youre really going to fight me how amusing you think you can best sir ilios
after all this  i still die  a commoner 
tch  you think you can push me around just cause im a commoner damn  i cant take this anymore 
i pray you dont hold a grudge but this is fate forgive me
ulster  shall  rise again 
mm  ill bear the shame of this defeat for the rest of my days  every third thought shall be my grave 
well done prince leif youve weathered another difficult situation with finesse and wisdom our motherland of leonster is but a stones throw away the people have been awaiting your return for many years now 
leonster  my kingdom 
indeed your sovereign land ah but i get ahead of myself  you were so young when we had to flee leonster it would be understandable if you do not remember her beauty
no i remember leonsters beauty but most of all i remember that night as long as i live ill never forget it
that night what do you remember milord
the night that castle leonster fell  the flames burned so brightly i thought it was already sunrise i remember just looking up at the sky from finns arms  at first i didnt understand what was happening but when i saw the look on finns face i knew something terrible had happened and i was filled with this  deep sorrow it was the first time in my life id felt such a profound sadness 
i forced finn into a tough role i admit but he was the only man for the job the only man i could trust with your life as long as the prince is safe the day will come when leonster rises again thats what i told him and off he rode clutching you to his chest away from the flames consuming the castle 
that was the last time i ever saw finn cry ever since then he hasnt shed a tear for anything  no not just cry its like he forgot how to laugh too 
he left a part of himself behind in leonster and hes not alone we all left a piece of our souls behind when we fled the motherland 
truth be told when the knights of ulster attacked from the rear i thought 
the disorder in their vanguard is what saved us frankly but still to see so many soldiers assembled so quickly  count conomor is indeed a splendid leader
hm count conomor
indeed hes a brave general of ulster a man of honorable heart and unshakable loyalty and as the saying goes there are no cowardly soldiers under a brave general
then why is such a man serving the empire does their tyranny not concern him
its most puzzling but there must be something were unaware of  regardless he isnt someone im eager to fight again
/***EOF***/
escaping tarrah may be difficult with all these civilians in tow 
civilians you mean townsfolk from tarrah are following us
im deeply sorry lord leif  i tried to convince them that accompanying us was too dangerous but nothing i said could sway them
sigh i can see that  well how many of them are there
about 600 and theyre following us in disorganized groups
that many we cant possibly escort them all the way to north thracia
i concur were busy enough fighting for our own lives to spare any manpower to babysit them in honesty ensuring their safe passage out of just this valley may prove to be difficult
but we cant turn a blind eye to them either at the very least we have to defend them until they can escape the valley instruct our forces to focus on protecting the townsfolk until theyre clear of the battlefield make that our first priority
understood prince leif
i take it the pegasus corps are prepared for battle captain misha
you wont be disappointed ive brought half of our whole mercenary company along theyll be ready to take to the sky shortly
very good you may return to leonster now ive no more use for you
no im not about to let you steal command of my squad right out from under me
oh come now captain were only here to mop up whats left of the liberation army as they retreat picking at a dead carcass is hardly a task suited to an esteemed pegasus knight such as yourself wouldnt you agree
i said no my squad is 
you have me mistaken for a man who repeats himself this is an order captain
i  all right i get it im going 
thanks for pullin our sorry bums outta the fire back there i brought this stamina drink along as a little taste of home for the road but i figure you can get way more use outta it than me
heh heh heh  you imbeciles
loptous lord of all  take this humble servants soul  into your embrace 
we dont fear death you simpletons 
it seems weve cheated death yet again our forces are all clear of the valley sire
gods breath what a relief now what should be our next course of action
id advise crossing over the dauph mountains to reach the road to nordrhein
the road to nordrhein so you propose that we make our way to leonster along the coast
thats my thinking yes but ive not yet heard augusts opinion on the matter at any rate well have to cross this mountain range regardless of which route we take we should make haste prince leif
a moment of your time august
l lord lewyn how  how were you able to find me so quickly your highness
weve been through much together you and i i know how you think when i heard tarrah had fallen i anticipated this would be the route youd take to escape the city it seems i was correct and with their defeat leifs army now faces a crisis of purpose  you certainly have your work cut out for you
it  seems i was not up to the task im sorry for disappointing you your highness
oh dont kid yourself tarrahs capitulation was inevitable we both knew this youve been doing a fine job
if you say so your highness 
now if theres no other matters of import i must be going i still have to check in on the orgahil region before returning to isaach it will likely be another year before were able to meet like this again until then i leave things in your capable hands august
another whole year  theres still so much left to be done 
/***EOF***/
ridding iz of the pirates who had infested it leif hurriedly resumed his course to munster it was not long until he arrived at kerberos gate a small fortress that guarded the entrance to the province of munster 
are the cattle being collected on schedule lobos
ah baron raydrik weve rounded up all the brats in the area rest assured for the time being ive locked them inside the forts prison what do you want done with them milord
hm best keep them there until the loptr church arrives to claim them the magi may well try to free the little worms see that your men are prepared for an incursion
magi as in those rebels from munster theyre still alive
to my great chagrin yes i thought theyd been wiped out but theyve resurfaced recently the little swarm of flies seem to have a new man in charge 
never a moments peace these days  and what of you sire will you be returning to munster
not immediately my journey has been most tiring and i would rest here while i can what better place for a man to catch his breath than the impregnable kerberos gate eh lobos
hah indeed sire
that fortress kerberos gate guards the road into munster as strongholds go its rather small but dont let its size fool you the people of this area say its more terrible than hell itself
why
the soldiers here no longer watch over the road they search for children lord leif the fortress now serves as a base for the provinces child hunts
child hunts what are you talking about august
 all across the empire children aged seven to thirteen are seized by imperial soldiers theyre sent to belhalla the capital and after the atrocities wrought upon them there  the ones who survive are never the same they are children no more they begin life anew as servants to the dark god loptous
thats inconceivable what manner of tall tale 
i realize it sounds too horrible to be true but this is no fable this is the state of jugdral even now children languish in captivity within that very fortress you see
 what soldier could willingly take part in such a thing no one with a spark of humanity left to be sure im sorry august but we must part ways here i cannot allow this evil to go unchallenged i must free those children from this barbarism
indeed  allow me to give you one last piece of advice sire kerberos gate is too small to fit horses so have any of your soldiers that fight on horseback dismount before entering further after everything theyve seen id wager the children are too traumatized to even move have your men carry them back to the villages and their families will owe you a debt they can never repay fortune be with you prince of leonster
hold this whole time youve known i was the heir to house leonster
but of course whats more i want to see you returned to power lets arrange to meet in munster after your business is concluded
please i beseech ye save me boy romeo from that gods forsaken fort
master coirpre taken by those savages  argh a pox on them all what am i to do 
me  me daugher  please good folk yer armed and fit fer battle bring me girl lucia back i beg of ye
me kid brother yubel was taken to kerberos gate  please stranger hes just a wee lad and youve the arms an army to give them imperial dastards what for
hm oh it cant be romeo safe and sound  from the depths of me heart i thank ye fer bringing me boy back single handed id like ye to have this this here rings been handed down in me family fer as long as i can remember its enchanted it is take it i insist
master coirpre thank the gods youre all right i was sick with worry  the young master is a noblemans ward and was coming to our village as a messenger but got mistaken for one of our own children you have my deepest thanks but ive little else to give  still i imagine rescuing a child of thracian nobility ought to pay off sooner or later
lucia oh me own girl hale and hardy thought me heart would give out from worry it would i cant begin to say how grateful i am to ye stranger dont have much in the way of thanks but  mayhap this old parchment could be of some good to you we been puzzlin over it fer years but what it does is beyond our ken all we know is that merely holdin it fills ye with tremendous vim and vigor amongst other things hope it helps ye i surely do
holy heim yubel yer safe you  gave me a real scare there  im so glad to see you again whatever yer reasons stranger thank you fer helpin truly now listen me older brother is an imperial soldier but ifn you ever meet him tell him what the empire done to our youngest kin his names dalsin aint a doubt in me mind hed help you so dont go forgettin it
wh who do you think you are you honestly believe youll get away with this
ugh  you fools  this doesnt end with me 
hmph youll come to regret this baron raydrik will hear every detail
 it was a hard fought victory but weve taken control of kerberos gate
nicely done im impressed truly such a shame to spoil your moment but i must ask you to drop your weapons otherwise ill have to do something very ugly to this very pretty young woman
nanna  raydrik you soulless parasite 
run lord leif dont worry about me
damn  fine  fine i said im putting my weapons down so keep your hands off nanna
hah see the young pup knows how to heel men move in and chain the good prince leif then fan out and seize the rest of his forces
damn  little leif got himself captured well two can play at that game im goin in and waving the white flag no doubt theyll arrest me too ill do what i can to protect the little lord from the inside the rest of you hightail it outta here and make ready to rescue him
i suppose this was inevitable  we  have no choice but to retreat  hold out for as long as you can lord leif on my honor i will come for you
dammit leif  nothing to be done about it now i guess were comin after you so dont you dare go dying first you hear
well  we lasted until now no one can say we didnt give it our all 
gods above watch over the prince 
damn it all the prince let imself be captured cant much stand it meself but fer now ive no choice but to head back to mount violdrake this aint the end though ill round up me whole crew and well storm munster
/***EOF***/
the throne of leonster the kingdoms rebirth leifs greatest desire was tantalizingly close to becoming reality 
i trust we have an understanding xavier
 milord
an understanding that im the only general who will tolerate your worthless life i couldve killed you at any moment over these past several years but i didnt in fact i made you my right hand man i trust you wont forget my generosity
right hand man i  ive merely done what i could to aid you nothing more
yes youve been quite the asset and if youll recall ive reciprocated that ive granted your every request within reason now how many lords do you think would do that
hah 
what is something funny oh is there something else you want princess well lets hear it out with it now
 unless you can bring back the dead i dont think you can help me
ah  funny very funny though it doesnt compare to your greatest joke your knighthood look at yourself youre every bit the fiend as i worse perhaps as the rebels resent you as a turncoat and traitor even if you were to betray me and offer them your sword theyd never accept you
i know that dammit ive prepared myself for this  after so long perhaps i can finally show my face to them even if its from across the field of battle  bah enough im just another soldier im not afraid to face death
august are you certain this is a good idea splitting our forces in two like this
its a necessary maneuver if we wish to claim the castles treasure for ourselves besides rescuing the hostages will require two teams working in tandem
and how do we talk down general xavier
with great difficulty i imagine if youre determined to save him however id try having the hostages speak with the eight adjutants perhaps theyll see reason just take care that theyre not spotted by imperial soldiers if gustavs men catch sight of an escaped hostage the plan is ruined
understood all right everyone take breaching positions by days end the flag of the gáe bolg will fly from castle leonster once more
papa papa stop it
ah youre all right im so glad  come along now with you back theres no reason to fight for the damned empire
its you
y youre safe look theres no reason for us to stick around here now lets go home 
father oh father im so sorry
h how  how did you get here  actually you know what i couldnt care less what miracle brought you back to me lets just get outta here never look a gift horse in the mouth son
stop it lower your weapon im here you dont have to fight anymore
aw really i was just starting to enjoy it too i i mean  if youre safe thats all that matters lets see ourselves out
hey just what do you think youre doing i have half a mind to run off without you
ah its not what you think i was only helping the empire because youd been imprisoned hey wait for me waaait
im sorry for everything youve been through  all this just for my sake 
ah father youre alive my kin is safe thats all i know about life and all i need to know come on lets get out of here
 
m mother ah  its all right mother you dont need to say anything im taking you home 
paaapa heeey papa 
y youre all right take my hand sweetie papas taking you home
general xavier
prince leif  mm good this is how its supposed to be i wanted to see you one last time ive no regrets left now
general what are you saying 
ah  need i spell it out regardless of my reasons i betrayed the crown i owe the kingdom a terrible debt and that cannot be changed but the guilt rests on my shoulders and mine alone my adjutants are innocent and merely followed my orders their only crime was placing their trust in me spare them from your justice i beg of you 
general  the way youve had to live  please raise your head im the one that owes you a terrible debt i fled the castle thinking it would protect the people but all i really did was abandon them i failed the highest duty of a ruler and left you to shoulder the burden for years youve carried this weight alone 
prince leif  ah  i  i  im glad i lived to see this day
xavier i too must offer you my sincerest apologies i had  erred in my judgment
duke dorias  your words are more than i deserve i  im 
prince leif needs men like you xavier its time to come home serve him once again
hah  if these old bones can do you any good theyre yours to fight against the empire is all i could want
lets get this over with shall we
f forgive me lord leif  glory  to leonster 
no  i cannot bear this disgrace  i cant stand it any longer 
aaargh you think ill just roll over for you im not going down without a fight
ugh  this rabble  how 
the last remains of the empires forces have been dealt with prince leif the castle is ours after 14 long years leonster has returned to its rightful ruler
thank you dryas i never wouldve made it here without your aid  i owe you much
you owe me nothing prince leif
finn  weve finally come home together its been our dream for so long  thank you for everything finn
lord leif  i  havent the words 
prince not to ruin your moment but i insist you live up to your word
princess miranda ah i havent forgotten the liberation of ulster
splendid then were on the same page so get out there and make for the front lines quickly now before we lose our chance
what do you mean has something happened in ulster
the citizens are plotting rebellion but they dont stand a chance on their own help them prince leif save the people of ulster as they once saved you
i apologize for disturbing you prince but someone wishes to speak with you shes come from ulster and ah stop you dont have leave to address the prince
youre prince leif right please i beg of you come to ulsters aid
ulster what are you talking about calm down and explain everything from the beginning
i think you already know ulsters situation the only reason the city is still standing is because it swears fealty to the empire but yesterday things reached a breaking point and the folk of ulster took up arms and rebelled
a rebellion  but the citizens of ulster fighting alone dont stand a chance have the knights of ulster joined this rebellion
im afraid not  we asked count conomor for his help many times but all he said was to wait eventually we grew tired of his excuses and revolted without him and his knights that rebellion swiftly ended in failure  then the empire retaliated and killed ulsters people by the dozens  our city faces its darkest hour lord leif youre the only hope for our people
 i understand ill head for ulster immediately
prince leif we should discuss this i share your feelings but we simply dont have the manpower to aid ulster before we do anything else we should shore up our defenses and fortify leonster
i agree with duke dryas assessment a frontal assault against the empire has little chance to succeed dont engage them on their terms dont let yourself be lulled into a false sense of security just because you have your motherland back our victories thus far have been because of the empires own blunders dont forget that
dryas august you would have me stand idly by and let the people of ulster be wiped out they sheltered me when i was but an infant and it was queen eithnes love and care that kept me alive father would never forgive me if i didnt repay their kindness if you cant understand that you can just wait in this damn castle
how disappointing  id hoped youd grown into a man but you still think like a child
 very well milord well ride for ulster ill take half our army now and lead a vanguard you can lead the other half on the morrow prince are we in agreement august
ah  is this how    no i should lead the vanguard please dryas
the prince needs you weve had our differences you and i but we wouldnt be here without you  after this you must devote all your skills all your intellect to prince leifs cause
   it shall be done
why not bring the whole army dryas ill go with you we can get a head start if we lead our troops at the same time
dont be so selfish prince our soldiers are exhausted the hope of liberating leonster was the only thing keeping them going just take a look around you they sleep like the dead but if their prince orders a march theyll push themselves to keep going even if it means their health would you put them through such a thing
 youve the right of it dryas i apologize even so will you have enough manpower
ah the motherland has provided that answer as well leonsters liberation will yield many able hands many who fought for the empire did so against their will their numbers will make up for the absent half of our army
very well ill follow behind you as soon as im able take care of ulsters people for me dryas
of course but before i depart theres one other matter of import
what is it has something happened
leonster once again stands free the kingdom has been reborn as the heir to leonsters throne you are now truly a prince in both deed and name bring glory to your title and live up to your duties as ruler
yes indeed ill strive to become a strong leader but my fight isnt over until i rescue eyvel we have to seize manster together dryas
mm  ive tarried long enough i must be off may the gods bless and keep you until we meet again
a few of the enemy soldiers have requested an audience with you my prince they claim to have been pressed into service against their will and that we saved them from that fate
very well show them in
i suppose congratulations are in order what with you takin back the throne an all but you didnt just save leonster you saved her soldiers too even though we aint nobles or anything so uh  wed like you to have this youve earned it
/***EOF***/
a battalion of imperial troops even larger in number than the one at fort nordrhein awaited them 
i see youve yet to deal with the rebels nicolov explain yourself
ah  kempfs bravado got the better of him and he broke rank for his own personal glory he ruined our chance to halt the rebels advance  you have my sincerest apologies
dammit kempf i give him a second chance and this is how he repays me i shouldve sent him back to castle friege like you said
no sir it was me that was too lenient with him  but despite kempfs failure im not worried ive stationed my squad of heavily armored knights in front of the castle bishop mua and his team of mages are also present next we have reinhardt and the gelbenritter already approaching the enemy from behind and if that wasnt enough we have the pegasus corps of silesse on stand by ready to assist us if things go south with this much strength behind us we could defeat any army
indeed  i can find no fault in what youve outlined ah one other thing i forgot to mention it but bishop saias will be gracing us with his presence he happened to be traveling nearby and graciously offered to lend us his power
the bishop saias the military genius
the one and only his missive said hed be arriving in a few hours
hah this just isnt the rebels lucky day is it in light of this ill shore up our defenses for the time being once the lord tactician arrives well launch our assault immediately marquess gustav i bid you remain in the castle and await word of our victory
very well im counting on you nicolov
ill not lie to you my prince the enemys formation is nearly flawless
how so
the main problem is the band of silessian mercenaries positioned in the northwest if we advance towards the castle theyll cut us down from behind
why not divide our forces and send a team to attack them first
we dont have the men to spare half our troops were left behind to defend against reinhardt and his army striking from the rear
so what should we do
how willing to fight are the silessian mercenaries that is the question 
do you understand the plan captain misha
 yeah i got it
very good and if youll pardon the intrusion theres one other matter 
that being
ive heard tell your mother was killed by the traitor sigurd during the civil war is that true
  
ah i take it thats why you became a mercenary fighting on behalf of the empire
this isnt about my mother back home weve got lots of starving children were doing this for them all we want is enough coin to buy bread and milk 
i see  bah that was a foolish thing to ask please forget i said anything
 then ill be taking my leave
colonel nicolov its been quite some time
oh bishop saias weve been waiting for you sire
how goes the battle
the enemy fights with an  unexpected ferocity were having some slight difficulties ah but having the bishop of flame at our side is sure to boost morale why i can already see a marked improvement
have commander reinhardt and the gelbenritter arrived yet
i expect them to be here any moment theyll descend upon the enemys rear guard like vultures to carrion
then now is the perfect time to launch a full frontal assault send word to the silessian mercenaries
it shall be done sire
w what is the meaning of this the enemys morale is suddenly sky high
my greatest fear  prince leif we cannot hesitate for even a moment we must order a retreat at once
what are you talking about explain yourself please
saias the royal bishop of house velthomer and a military genius has taken the field as long as he commands the enemy we dont stand a chance
theres been such a person in the empire all along
ah  ill give you the short version hes the son of the late general aida who was a close friend and confidante of emperor arvis after she passed away under most puzzling circumstances i might add he was raised in a bragian monastery
 i understand but its not that simple we stand to lose countless soldiers if i call for a retreat now what should i do 
nows our chance to wipe out the rebels lower the bridge over the river
damn  i didnt think it would take this long to get here theres no time to waste order the whole army to charge
general muller what happened to commander reinhardt
hes left for conote with princess ishtar im not privy to the details but her highness was acting strangely  id imagine he was worried about her
he left to babysit the princess instead of coming to battle what kind of soldier is he
a better one than youll ever be now shut your mouth youre insulting the chain of command
agh f forgive me general i meant nothing by it
still this is going to make things harder on us 
bishop saias is this where youve gone
hm princess ishtar and commander reinhardt too whatever is the matter you look panicked
its prince julius  hes fallen terribly ill hes running a high fever and seems to be in great pain 
the prince has always had a frail constitution but his health has been declining as of late  what of the loptian bishops can they do anything
i wont allow it as long as i draw breath theyll not come near him
even archbishop manfroy why
shouldnt you know that better than anyone royal bishop saias please you have to see things my way
 i understand ill see if i can be of some help where is his highness
back in conote in my chambers
very well  let us be off princess ishtar
what bishop saias is leaving for conote not good  we have to shore up our defenses destroy that bridge
captain misha hey last i checked silesse wasnt all buddy buddy with the empire why are you on their side
i have something to protect simple as that
 and what would that be
none of your damn business thats what off with you now the battle is just getting started
  
ah sara where do you think youre going
  
oh are you with the liberation army did this young woman say something to you please dont put too much stock into it the girl sometimes blurts out the strangest nonsense  shes a bit touched in the head im afraid
 go 
go go where”
 go  i will go with them 
b but they said they were with the army ah sara wait
go  take me with you you have to take me with you 
as if you could defeat me tch  have at you
ugh  not bad  guess i couldnt do it  after all 
loptous o lord god  i give myself  to your new era 
now youll see why the gelbenritter are so feared
ergh  its unthinkable  we stand  defeated 
how naive 
sheathe your weapon you cannot best me
get out of my way
ugh  deetvar my beloved mother  ill see you soon 
i thank you for your mercy but i still have to fight
weve managed to capture the castle gates but many more foes doubtless await us inside dont let your guard down prince leif
then weve little choice but to eliminate them all at once excessive though it may seem the man inside marquess gustav is king blooms right hand man and hes been ruling leonster with an iron fist how many people have died at his whim 
kill gustav and hang his head from the castle gates dont waste your mercy on him you must fulfill your duty as ruler
prince leif weve captured the commander of the silessians what shall we do with her
let her through please i want to have a look at her is it true youre the commander of the silessian forces
this is a waste of time  i dont expect mercy from you just kill me and get it over with
this isnt going to work prince the pegasus knights of silesse value honor above all after leading her troops to their death the shame would be too much to bear especially as a prisoner we should grant her death as she wishes that would be mercy
duke dorias dont say something so stupid captain misha you have something to protect dont you how will you do that if you die here those poor kids in silesse are depending on you you havent thought about them
ah  how do you know about that
i asked one of your troops i saw her lying on the battlefield and tried to help  that was when she told me i didnt know how many people were going hungry in the places where the empire is still in charge  so many children thin as a blade of grass  just wasting away  she told me shed hired on with the empire just to buy food
  
lady misha dont you see the irony its almost funny in a macabre way by helping the empire youre sacrificing the children of another country to save the children of your own country the empire is conducting child hunts in thracia and it wont be long until they do the same in silesse who will protect silesses children then
child hunts  what in blazes are you talking about
so you dont know  then i want you to live a little longer and see the truth for yourself i sentence you to live to bear witness to our pain and suffering
 im sorry im a little overwhelmed here just give me some time i need to think 
/***EOF***/
 half a year has passed the army of house friege led by barat has waged a relentless onslaught against leonster seeking to recapture the castle leifs liberation army has fought well but has been gradually worn down and forced into a small corner of the castle with no way out everyone could see it was only a matter of time until castle leonster fell 
how goes the war lord barat
ah reinhardt ive been waiting for you youve brought my reinforcements i trust
a battalion is on its way here from ulster they should be arriving shortly
hmm  yes that should do it weve already seized most of the castle these few halls are the rebels last refuge
normally that would be good news but 
hmm what do you mean is something amiss
this siege has gone on for half a year yet leonster still stands king bloom is  displeased i dont mean to speak out of turn especially to one of my elders but  id suggest you hurry
 youre not telling me anything i dont already know
the kings temper worsens by the day the loss of prince ishtore at fort melgen has been taking its toll on him 
what of the isaachian rebels
i hear theyve already crossed the border into the thracian peninsula but theyre not entering unopposed cowen and the 26th battalion vampa and her sisters as well as lady tine and her unit of mages are all moving to intercept them still the rebels were able to best lady liza  i fear the coming battle will be a most arduous one indeed
and what does his highness himself intend to do
i believe the king plans to personally take command of the troops at ulster should the isaachian rebels break through to the city i imagine hell send for you but if leonster should still remain in enemy hands by that time your future will be  most uncertain
ah  very well youve made yourself clear
then i must be returning to conote if youll excuse me 
you get over here
uh  y yes sir
send word to all the troops were launching an all out assault on castle leonster there will be no retreat fight with all your soul if you want to live
 the enemy has begun their assault prince leif
can we mount a defense
ive already ordered as much everyone that can stand upright is fortifying the castle if we fall here we have nowhere to run
weve done quite well against such an enormous army considering everything holding out for half a year under siege  but well reach our limit before long
bah youve become overfond of such feeble whining its unseemly for a prince of your stature if youre not willing to fight to the last breath youre betraying the memory of all who have sacrificed themselves to get us this far dont forget the bigger picture were keeping the bulk of the enemys forces busy here which frees seliphs army to march through thracia unimpeded you mustnt give up before were able to merge our forces
im sorry august i know  and i do want to meet lord seliph myself but how else do you expect me to feel having to watch our soldiers die one by one
if it pains you so thats all the more reason to honor their memory by fighting to the last man
you nuisances have cost me my rank
ugh  so this is  where 
prince leif the friege army has captured the throne our troops are fleeing en masse our war  is over 
prince leif the enemy is retreating
what why would they do that
because seliphs army has arrived theyve already surrounded castle ulster and are mounting an assault as we speak this is our salvation weve done it were saved
truly  lord seliph  has  hold a moment august how do you know this
ah listen to me go on  ive forgotten myself just now an emissary of lord seliph arrived he awaits you inside the other chamber
lord seliphs emissary i must meet him please send him in
so we meet at last prince leif im a soldier in the service of lord seliph i go by diarmuid
diarmuid but that would make you  are you nannas older brother
i am
was there anything else you needed to tell me on behalf of lord seliph
no sire
then now that thats done its my honor to introduce you to nanna
diarmuid  brother 
nanna nanna its really you
yes
im so sorry it took me such a long time to find you  if i had just known you were here from the start i wouldve dropped everything to be by your side i only finally learned of you through lord lewyn 
lord lewyn 
hes lord seliphs tactician theres nothing the man doesnt know  and he told me about mother too  how she was trying to reach isaach but vanished in the aed desert 
ah shes  not with you i  i see  i had resigned myself to the fact that id likely never see her again but even so  mother  oh gods 
im sorry nanna mother was traveling all that way for me 
no dont think like that i used to resent her for leaving but now that im older i understand how mother felt  all women feel the same deep love for their children ive seen as much 
i havent given up nanna lord lewyn said mother was still alive we can search for her together when the war is finally over so  dont cry anymore ok prince leif i have a request if i may would you permit me to transfer into your army ill ask lord seliph for his leave to do so once we rejoin him
of course id be glad to have you along to support nanna ill explain the situation to lord seliph
/***EOF***/
hmm  the fort is in terrible danger and it only seems to be getting worse 
 we have word that the rebels have already gained control of the gates sir
hmph i suppose it was only a matter of time until the rebels came to free the prisoners well were ready for it if worse comes to worst go ahead with our  last resort do i make myself clear
clear as a vial of pure water sir
so this is the imperial prison camp 
as i understand it most of the soldiers captured throughout thracia are sent here its extremely likely that troops captured from our army are in this very camp yet this chance will be squandered if you dont hurry
what do you mean
have you already forgotten weve a report that clearly states a battalion of loptian mages are en route
could it be the schwarze rosen  well lets not stay and find out we must make haste to rescue the prisoners
soldiers of leonster yet remain here  hah now theyll witness the sublime power of loptous
you can still walk away just go home
gah no  not  like  this 
hmm  its not enough that bloom is struggling to hold conote against the isaachian rebels now the friege army has lost this fort as well what a spectacular family of failures  house friege is a joke
i  i apologize on behalf of my kin 
heh heh  youre hardly at fault ishtar theres no need for you to apologize yet having said that i cant allow you to join the battle in conote yourself i  need you with me
as you wish  but where are we to go instead
miletos hilda has been pestering me to come
mother  what ever for
to see the results of her harvest of course i must say shes been quite delighted with governing the city since i gave her the throne
mother  has  do you mean to say  shes been conducting child hunts
you know miletos climate is quite pleasant this time of year i think it would be an ideal place for two people to spend time together yes that sounds perfect  ill buy you a dress of fine silk ishtar and what else would go nicely with it  ah i know just the thing a ruby tiara hilda is already arranging a most splendid banquet for us im sure ishtar you can dress up and take everyone by surprise with your captivating beauty im dearly looking forward to it  oh ishtar im so glad to have you by my side 
l lord julius 
ishtar  that man reinhardt  i dont want him near us anymore
reinhardt hes watched over me since i was a child i rely on him every day
i dont care i hate the way he looks at you if i see him ill pluck out his eyes myself
ah  i  i understand  forgive me but i must ask this of you let reinhardt go home please
heh heh  very well well leave him be lets be off oh ishtar  how i love you

a coastal village by the name of iz 
bucks is this kind of body count really necessary were here to make coin not gut everything that moves
look ere smart aleck we got us a nice division of labor goin i dont tell you how to plan your strategies and whatnot and you dont tell me ow to go about plunderin oh and if its them freeblade folk yer worried about we already saw to them the boss tipped off the empire that the leonster boy was hidin with em
leonster boy  wait you mean leif the prince are you certain of this
sure am the boss grabbed one of the village folk an used his talents with a knife to loosen is tongue stubborn fella though mighta survived if hed talked sooner
he resorted to torture did he 
hah yer one to talk boss says yer the one who taughtim everythin he knows about interrogatin theres a reason you aint with the church no more mate
dammit lifis  youve become more trouble than youre worth its time we parted ways i just need to make contact with the leonster heir and then lifis is disposable now how should i go about this  well before anything else i must alert my benefactor 
commander over here that village is being raided
hmm  thats lifis crew by the look of it theyve been quiet as a mouse for a while but i guess they move fast
and we have to move faster we cannot stand by and allow this to happen
finn look here that village is being raided
whats this these pirates answer to a man named lifis as i recall but theyve been quiet for so long i thought they mightve disbanded
seems they have a macabre idea of a reunion then ready yourself finn we cannot stand by and allow this to happen
ronan stop ronan
ma i cant stay outta this any longer ill go and fight alongside  oh you must be with the freeblades i want to join yall im good enough with a bow and i can get around pretty fast i wont hold you back none
b but youve never been in a real fight like this before  you that eager to leave yer mother alone in this world
that dont matter none every battle is somebodys first right guess thisll be mine i mean maybe you can stand holing up in here an waiting to die but i sure cant
you lot just had to play hero didnt you now this whole village will be razed by the pirates in revenge theyll make one big bloody example outta us what are we supposed to do
how can you say something so cruel brother these people are puttin their lives on the line fer us and youve got the nerve to complain
youre too naïve the pirates wouldve killed a few of us sure but they had no reason to hunt down everybody except these idiots couldnt leave well enough alone
 im sorry bout my brother he wasnt always like this by way of apology take this magic trinket not sure what it does but maybe itll be of use to you its about time somebody showed those pirates what its like to fight for their lives for a change
these pirates grow bolder by the day just recently i heard that a cleric fleeing tarrah was taken prisoner by em mayhap you can help the poor dear eh here take this for your trouble if you manage to find her do send word that shes all right
you have any idea who yer dealin with im the bucks a beast born from a life at sea
ugh  youll regret this someday  i  deserved to die at sea 
thats it no collectin the bounty on my head or nothin well ill be im leavin my piratin days behind me cant leave the sea behind me though reckon ill become a fisherman clear skies to you freeblades
lord leif i presume
 and you are
august at your service i am a priest of bragi on pilgrimage
is there something you need from me with respect i dont have time to spare on talk
neither do i i take it youre headed to the corsair isles to nip this pirate threat in the bud
indeed if we leave them be its only a matter of time until the scum attack iz again besides i hear theyre also keeping a cleric captive there
i see in that case allow me to be your navigator i can guide you to the isles
what why would a priest know the way to the corsair isles
this old man has many surprises left in him yet ill tell you that much still the decision is yours

the magi led by ced who were trying to defend the civilians and the knights of manster who were determined to stop them the region had become a war zone and the fighting grew worse with each day 
sir ced raydrik has found our last safehouse theres nowhere for us to shelter the children now
blast would that i could escort them out of here myself but that would leave our rebellion without a leader there just isnt anyone up to the task of getting the children to safety on their own 
i could carry out that duty if youd allow it
who goes there who  who in blazes are you
a simple traveler nothing more i heard about the fighting that had broken out here if you wish to spirit the children away from this foul place perhaps i could help or are you unwilling to trust me
hmm  i sense your heart is enveloped in a gentle wind you dont seem to mean us harm just who are you exactly you wear the robes of the royal priesthood 
we havent the time for me to explain my life story im afraid but i give you my word that ill see the children to safety you can either trust me or not choose now
 very well i have little alternative but to believe you ah one more thing when you flee with the children please you must make sure this sword escapes the city as well
a sword  ah ill gladly smuggle it out of manster of course but do you realize what this weapon is its bragi sword id heard it was being kept in castle manster under heavy guard
it was but i saw to that you see raydrik is protected by an enchantment upon his own blade the loptous sword bragis blade is the only thing that can breach its foul magic
i see  so what would you have me do with it
the blade can only be wielded by a swordsman of holy blood a rebel leader prince leif is marching his liberation army here as we speak he can use it i want you to deliver it to him
i understand ill see that it reaches his hands
youve my gratitude oh sir priest you must give me your name at least 
ah forgive my rudeness i am  i am saias of house velthomer
what those peasants dare to flee manster
im afraid so sire and it seems the magi have been sheltering children theyre making a run for it right now
thats unacceptable those cattle are the only bargaining chips we have to get the empire to overlook this mess farden cut them down in the streets slay every last little brat lets show every damn peasant in manster what the price of fleeing is
leave it to me milord
you called lord raydrik
alfan i want you to take command of the castle gates guard them with your life i hear leonsters stray mutt is marching on manster and the magi have already breached the castle once  they must not be allowed to seize control of the gates as well
of course sire well take every measure to secure the city
weve reached manster at last 
 it appears the fighting between the magi and the knights of manster has broken out into the streets things have escalated since last we were here the knights seem weaker than before but theyre still a force to be reckoned with without the magis aid i fear seizing manster will be nigh impossible  oh whats this look theres movement around the city whole groups of children are fleeing manster
what theres no time to lose lets move
whats the situation in manster coruta
nothing unusual yet but if our intelligence is accurate there should be massive troop movements very shortly and in all that chaos well have the perfect chance to strike 
but such a plan risks dragging the civilians into our fighting   even if we dont conquer manster as long as its liberated from the empire well have dealt a tremendous blow to our mutual enemy why risk innocent lives when we could simply join forces with the rebels and still do just as much damage to the empire
ah  but this is a command directly from his majesty 
 then let me speak to father i can convince him
bah lady altena is too naive  well never have another opportunity like this to seize manster for ourselves his majesty is always lenient with the princess but even he wont indulge her this time our best chance is to strike manster now just as his majesty ordered 
you wished to see me lord alfan
ah yes  i seem to have misplaced my grimoire
oh gods again
hm speak up i cant hear you
uh it was nothing  so which book have you lost this time
my tome of venin you know the one its what allows me to strike our foes from great distances should be easy to find its very distinctive bound in leather dyed black as midnight on a moonless night every page written with snake venom  ah its magnificent
im looking im looking hold your horses  ohhh i hope its easier to find than the last one 
lord alfan i found it
really splendid now watch as i unleash my horrifying magic upon the unsuspecting rebels
well before you make with the horrifying magic maybe you should learn to tidy up your room first 
well well all of manster is in disarray just like our intelligence said it would be nows our chance we couldnt ask for a better way to take the city ourselves
hold if we strike now its the civilians wholl suffer most perhaps i could talk them into surrendering 
these are the kings orders dammit its useless to keep stalling even if youre the princess
im in command here
and this is my battalion besides the king already sent word to attack manster even if you refused
he did 
you can just stay here and watch if it means that much to you but my battalion is moving in with or without you
coruta wait coruta no  i must convince father to halt this attack 
pant  pant  wh what manner of heathen are you
i am ced of the magi weve taken control of the city save for one wing of the castle surrender now and ill spare your life
oh how droll but i wont fall for such an obvious bluff
arent you  sir ced
prince leif hah so youve finally arrived
sorry to have kept you waiting i never did get a chance to thank you for rescuing me prince ced 
ah  so my secret is out i see how did you learn that im a prince did karin tell you
she did if what she said is true you stayed behind here to protect the people of manster instead of returning to your native silesse im sorry ive proven to be such a worthless prince  everything youve gone through all comes down to my own weakness i had a chance to liberate the city when last i was here but all i could do was run that was unforgivable of me
theres no need to apologize prince its no fault of yours my plan was doomed from the start i had intended to liberate much more of the city and its people but not even my holy weapon the tome of forseti could overcome the power of raydriks loptous sword because of that one miscalculation i lost many of the very people id come here to save im to blame for all of this not you
even so  i envy you prince ced the people hail you as a hero and theyre not wrong youre everything that im not holy blood runs strong in your veins and you can wield the very weapon your namesake once used and i  i have nothing im a world apart from the likes of you and lord seliph i  im no crusader 
prince leif  how could you say such a thing being a crusader means more than just happening to inherit the right kind of blood for centuries jugdral was ruled by the loptr church and its empire the crusaders were the ones that overthrew their rule and thats exactly what youve been doing for a whole year now prince leif youve fought and bled to liberate the people of thracia you walked a path that wouldve broken lesser men but on you marched waging your own holy war to free countless souls from the grip of the empire neither lord seliph nor i have any right to call ourselves better than you youre the youngest of us you spent your childhood being hunted and youve never stopped fighting in fact youve been fighting for longer than any of us have if youre not a crusader who the hell is take heart prince leif your soul sings with the voice of njorun youve done her legacy proud
prince ced  i dont know how to thank you i look at you and lord seliph see the scale of what youve accomplished see the enormity of your armies  and then i think of my own mistakes of the people ive failed and i feel so  small small and weak like a sickly child standing beside giants heh perhaps i am still a child in many ways
then that would mean i holy weapon and all needed to be rescued by a child do you mean to insult me
ah  n no thats not what 
hah i was only joking prince leif though this is hardly the time to fool around  ahem back to the matter at hand my men and i have raydrik pinned down in a small wing of the castle with no way for him to escape alas theres a complication hes using the few remaining children in the castle dungeon as hostages the magi dont have the manpower to both storm the castle and keep fighting the knights of manster in the streets prince leif will you lend me your strength and lead your forces into the castle while the magi keep order in the city
it would be my honor to fight alongside you ive a score to settle with raydrik
how fitting that the twofold traitor will meet his end at the hands of the prince of leonster   gods be with you prince leif
a  priest youre the one that led the children to safety
indeed i did so on behalf of sir ced of the magi thank you for taking us in
think nothing of it if anything you deserve all the thanks for seeing the children out of the city leave the rest of the fighting to us you should get somewhere safe father
ah  now that i get a good look at you i take it youre prince leif
that i am how did you know
theres no time listen closely you must take this sword with you and keep it close at hand this is bragi sword youll need it if youre to defeat raydrik
bragi sword youre  giving this to me
make no mistake sir ced wanted you to have this i gave him my word that i would deliver it to you its a sacred blade that can only be wielded by someone of holy blood but sir ced knows little of swordplay himself you see
a sacred blade  the holy weapon of bragi himself  the gods themselves must have sent this sword as an act of providence  ill see that it meets raydriks neck before long thank you for everything father
im  just happy to have played my part but remember when the time comes to face raydrik you must bring that sword with you its the only thing that can breach the enchantment which protects him may we meet again lord leif
how can this be the magi were  wiped out
without their leader the magis ranks have collapsed we dont have the forces to seize manster on our own  the city is thracias for the taking 
heh heh heh  youve only got yourself to blame youre dead
glory  to  thracia ugh 
when we meet again youll regret not finishing me off
you how did you make it this far
ugh   not yet  i wont  die  yet 
youre  sparing me well im  quite grateful
witness the fury of the knights of manster you damned rebels
ugh  but i was  supposed to 
you have my gratitude if youll excuse me 
it certainly wasnt easy but the gates of castle manster are ours prince leif how shall we proceed from here
the magi can keep order in the streets while we storm the castle raydrik has fled inside to make his last stand and he means to use the captive children as hostages
then we have our work cut out for us  ah theres something you should be aware of my prince i have intelligence stating that raydriks blade the loptous sword is enchanted with dark magic that shields him from all harm if were to defeat him we must prepare some kind of countermeasure before we enter the castle
ah im one step ahead of you i received a sword bragi sword from the priest that fled manster with the children its a holy weapon thats every bit the equal of raydriks blade and more importantly it can breach the magic protecting him
hmm  thats quite fortuitous for once just make absolutely certain you have bragis blade in hand before the next battle my prince
what will you do now father
i have nowhere to return to theres only one thing i can do now i shall go to the tower of bragi and pray for guidance
 can you tell me nothing more of your circumstances how exactly did you end up here
i cant say not now
i see i dont suppose theres any chance you could stay with us a little longer we could use your help liberating manster
ive seen enough of battle for one lifetime i already fear that my heart may have grown too accustomed to warfare  but know that ill be praying for your good fortune from the tower of bragi be well lord leif

 tanya its time fer you to go make a break fer it on yer own ill keep any of em from followin ya
no way papa i leave when you leave
you stick around here youll just be a burden now just listen to yer old man and dont give me lip
i  i know i wouldnt be much help but 
aw dont tell me you were thinkin of leavin the party already nope the only way you two are gettin out of here is in a casket
listen up gomes i got no reason to fight you an yer boys think about this afore you do somethin rash
naw its too late fer you to be makin excuses dagdar the soil itself dont want us here nothin grows tryin to till a field is like sawing through rock all i wanted was a full belly but you let that wench eyvel cheat you outta the good land shes got you wrapped around her little finger you so desperate that youd let everybody starve just to get lucky shame on you old man
whatd you say hmph you talk big fer a glorified errand boy you aint never known real hardship just my petty chores you know why cuz i knew i could never trust you with more fact is i could barely trust you with my laundry junior but all these years i still gave you a roof over yer head  fine you want yerself a fight so bad you got one
tanya youre safe you  really had me worried there you moron
who you calling a moron moron nobody asked you to fret over me
would it kill you to show a little gratitude if wed showed up any later youd just be a stain on the floor
what youre the one who started this argument i hadnt said one word to you when you started yelling at me ugh youre always like this gloomy little osian always ready to pick a fight  whatever i lack for gratitude you lack for manners just this once you could stand to be even a little friendly 
h hey wait wait dont cry ok i  i just  i mean i was really   im glad youre safe er  so anyhow  uh  yeah
dagdar youre all right
well ill be  prince leif heh an here i was the one who was supposed to be rescuin you sorry fer draggin ya into my mess  so wheres eyvel she head back to fiana or is she with you
  
prince  what happened
eyvel is  still in munster we  didnt have the forces to rescue her i couldnt save her 
wh what dammit leif are you a real prince or just a child how the hell could ya just leave her
there was nothing i could do i  i wasnt strong enough wasnt fast enough i  with my meager strength what good am i to anyone what should i do what can i do
  
if  if id just been a little stronger  if i had done things differently maybe 
dammit prince yer puttin too much of the blame on yerself
but 
look im sorry fer yellin at you just now i  i wasnt expecting things to go so wrong an i took it out on you truth be told prince yer toughern most you tried to rescue her right ya made the effort and it aint yer fault it didnt work out
d dagdar 
sure you kids are goin through some rough times right now no doubt but quit yer worryin cuz ill be helpin ya from now on it aint like anybody can replace eyvel but you still got a long way to go before this war is lost an hey captured aint dead right well get eyvel back together
dammit dont you dare underestimate the great gomes ill shrug off whatever you got
d dagdar boss  im sorry  but everybody was starvin to death an you were too stupid to see it 
i just wanted to help  to have enough to eat you know ill find a way boss  ill find a way
i pity dagdar and his men truly but  why couldnt they just earn their food through honest labor
and where would they labor their very land was infertile many of these men were children of thracian farmers abandoned by their parents they turned to banditry out of sheer necessity their choice was simple steal or starve
then they had cowards for parents to have forsaken their children so
and how would you know youve been on the run for your whole life true but youve never known the pains of hunger just where do you think your food came from during all those days you were fleeing from the empire
where my food came from i  dont know i never had to worry about hunger
then you were fortunate to have had such loyal allies and retainers but it has left you lacking the perspective to truly understand how the common folk suffer south thracia is a land dominated by mountains steep imposing crags dot the landscape and a cliff lies around every corner by nature the land demands severity and discipline from all who live in it farmers work themselves to the bone to cultivate what few crops the land will provide but even so it is not enough to survive on and thus they are left with a terrible dilemma for every one person who gets fed two others must go hungry dagdars men abandoned in their youth are the result of this ruthless arithmetic this is the reality of living in south thracia
th then they should just import food from elsewhere in north thracia cities had an abundance of crops buy their excess
ah but the whole of north thracia the old coalition of munster resolved long ago to prohibit trade with south thracia food especially was closely guarded
 wh why would the north do such a thing
historically recall the war between njörun and dáinns children 100 years ago that led to the province of munster declaring independence from the rest of thracia the two have considered each other enemies ever since and this hostility persists because they are mutually unwilling to communicate the noble houses of munster in particular remained stubborn and selfish for a century afterward
i  had been told that thracia was all but a military state that it was an infamously belligerent kingdom but if they are merely the product of such wretched conditions  how did things all go so wrong the north and south were a single kingdom once 
it all returns to the tragedy of the gáe bolg to the misfortune that seems to befall all those who wield either of the holy lances north thracia has been plagued by selfish and short sighted rulers you must learn from their example learn how not to govern if nothing else you must learn enough to not repeat your fathers mistake

indeed were already inside the loptians secret temple stay alert prince leif
it certainly looks how youd expect a hidden loptian enclave to everything is so dark i can barely see past my own nose where could eyvel be
that i dont know im afraid weve little choice but to search until we find her
  
eyvel come on eyvel
  
eyvel its me leif can you hear me
leif  l lord  leif  ah little lord what are you doing here you gotta break out of here and fast
eyvel  things are very different now than when you were last awake 
different whats gotten into your head were still in the same huh wait what is this place 
eyvel  thank goodness  youre just like how you were before
little leif  just what the hell happened to me
im sorry but theres not enough time for me to explain everything  all you need to know is that were fighting to liberate thracia from the empire and were in the middle of recapturing munster right now we need your strength now more than ever eyvel
heh  already too old to keep calling me commander i see a lot must have happened  all right well talk later but well have time to catch up after this battle right
of course theres so much i want to tell you eyvel 
  
mother hang on mother
  
mother cant you hear me
  
im so sorry mother  i  i 
 what are you crying for mareeta
huh m mother
good youre back to your senses  now cmon we gotta get out of here before huh wait what is this place 
mother youre all right 
course i am what you thought raydriks goons would be able to do me in give your old mom some credit speaking of him just where did that dastard run off to and howd we end up here 
raydrik hes  hes already dead we killed him oh mother so much has happened  one of the loptian bishops working for raydrik had  turned you to stone 
loptian bishop  thats right that bald guy in the robe i only saw him for a second and then   that man is dangerous where is he
hes the one were hunting now weve taken the fight to the loptians home this is their secret stronghold in thracia mother please we need your help ive prayed for the day when i could fight alongside you again
you dont even have to ask mareeta ill always have your back no matter what still  not to bring down the mood but im sorry for everything i can tell i mustve put you kids through a lot 
mother 
eyvel  i wanted so badly to see you again  every day we spent fighting the empire this past year was another night i spent dreaming of this reunion  and now that dream has come true im so glad youre all right 
has it already been a whole year since that day in the arena ah little lord  well i guess youre not so little anymore youre a man now and a real prince at that
eyvel  i realized i never thanked you its only because of you that i was able to have a peaceful childhood for three happy years i was able to play with the other kids in fiana spending every day just as carefree as a normal boy  i learned how to fight and i even roughhoused with the other children  do you remember how many times you had to scold me eyvel even that could be fun sometimes  id spent my life on the run and it was just another new experience for me we didnt share blood but we were a family finn was my father you were my mother and nanna and mareeta were my sisters and i got to make friends with boys my own age like osian and halvan back then the only thing i wanted was for those days to go on forever  i have you to thank for all that eyvel you let me experience what having a mother was like  you gave me back the warmth of family that id forgotten so long ago 
oh little leif  i still remember the day you entered my life you and little nan wandered into the village with finn who was hurt so badly he could hardly manage to stay atop his horse little nan was begging me to save her father her cute eyes turned red with tears and all i could think to do was hug her but you  heh thats when i knew there was something different about you you just looked me dead in the eye held up the sword that was on your belt and said ill give you this if you help him wasnt till later that i realized how much it meant to you i heard the blade was an heirloom belonged to your mother right but i remember wondering just what kind of ordeal must these three have been through to make this little boy so calm right now  i cant remember my own childhood little lord ten years ago the villagers of iz found me washed up on the shore i dont know anything about what i did before that  who was i  did i have a husband kids i dont have the slightest idea but when i first met you two i realized something real bad mustve happened to me in my own youth too so i figured if i couldnt remember my own childhood i could do the next best thing and give a childhood to two kids that needed one never imagined you would turn out to be the prince of leonster though 
eyvel  truth be told i was always jealous of mareeta i would look at her and think if only i had a mother i could depend on like she does i cried about that more times than i can count but i never realized i did have a mother all along you eyvel you found a way to love all of us equally without condition ill never be able to express my gratitude for that 
oh little lady  cmon youre the princess of nordion the blood of hoðr runs in your veins theres no doubt in my mind your mother is out there somewhere alive i mean look what happened to me stranger things have happened you just keep watching out for little leif never give up youll find her again someday 
its good to have ya back eyvel i been tryin to help these lads as best i could but nobody could ever replace you
you dont give yourself enough credit dagdar without your help defending fiana i dont know if i couldve survived as long as i have we made quite the team 
d dont be stupid  i uh didnt really do much 
papa your face is all red cut it out youre so embarrassing
commander  it wasnt just lord leif youve been like a mother to all the children of fiana especially me and my little sister after we lost our parents you were there to watch over us you practically raised us so i  ive been fighting this whole time just to get you back
halvan  im sorry for everything ive put you through when this is all over lets head back to fiana together heh poor little patricia probably worried herself half to death over us 
like a mother huh  well ma passed a long time ago but pa aint going anywhere guess having that old coot around is still better than not having anyone i think i finally get that now 
im happy to hear you say that you big lug youve got it better than somebody like halvan osian  take good care of your father when you make it back to fiana you hear
mareeta whats wrong what are you doing over here by yourself
m mother 
cmon youre a beautiful woman now so dont go making a mess of your face with all those tears here wipe them off
mother  i  i 
there there sweet pea im ok now see everythings gonna be all right 
 who are you
i had half a mind to just leave but i had to spare you a few words im not much for talk so  ill make it fast my daughter  how youve raised her what youve made of her  thank you
huh  y youre mareetas 
thatd be me yeah her mother  she died just after giving birth and after that the kid and i wandered the world together not proud of it but  one day when i took my eyes off her a slaver up an took her from me
 she was just a little girl when i found her a young innocent thing wrapped in chains and up for sale in the markets of conote when i saw her i just lost it  killed every last slaver and the bodyguards they had with em too id have done anything just to get those damned chains off her she  said her name was mareeta and that shed been with her father until a little while ago i tried to get her home tried to find you  but i couldnt
no  youre not to blame for any of this i never shouldve led a nomads life with such a small child to begin with my daughter was very lucky to have found you  this is selfish of me but  i think itd be best if you were the one who watched over her after all this
i agree mareeta is my daughter now has been for years i wouldnt let you take her away from me even if you wanted to
good  after this is all over ill go back to my life of wandering youll never have to see me again
then before you leave i have one last favor to ask galzus
name it if its within my power it will be done
once every year would you visit us in fiana thats all i ask
   very well  i will
eyvel  i regret i couldnt do more for you after everything youve done for us but i wanted you to know how grateful i am
and im grateful to you finn for everything youve done for fiana over the years i couldnt find a finer knight in all of jugdral
i never planned on telling you this but after overhearing about your amnesia it wouldnt be right to stay silent i  once knew a woman who looked just like you 
just like me  are you sure youre not just confused finn
no im certain when lord quan fought in lord sigurds army gods rest their souls there was a woman a soldier who served alongside us she was an unmistakable sight on the battlefield  with her long blonde hair waving in the wind you could mistake her for a goddess she was the eldest lady of house yngvi and inheritor of the holy bow yewfelle  her name was brigid
brigid  finn are you saying that woman  was me
yes  well probably
heh  i never took you for a romantic finn if i had holy blood id have a brand somewhere on my body but i dont youve got the wrong person finn im just an ordinary sellsword making my way from place to place  im eyvel of fiana

the liberation army the time was finally right to head for tarrah and break the siege upon the city the liberation army made their way to the imperial thracian border which they would cross by passing through noel canyon a small gap in the otherwise impassible mountain range 
has there been any change general largo
hm youre doing reconnaissance again today lady olwen i admire your fortitude coming this far into the mountains every morn
shes been assigned to it on the direct orders of general kempf theres no doubt hes out to harass her having her make such a back breaking trek each day 
truth be told fred id rather be out here than cooped up in fort dandrum having to look at kempfs face every hour of the day
oh ho ho scathing words but general kempf is  quite an embarrassment really a highborn noble his impudence and pettiness undermine his stature and he behaves closer to a boy than a man perhaps its natural to be a little insecure when general reinhardts fame has so thoroughly eclipsed his own but to be so vindictive about it as to take it out on the generals only sister youd scarcely believe there was any noble blood in him at all hes a disgrace to his uniform
general kempf is utterly convinced that my lord brother is somehow his competition he doesnt understand the solidarity that comes with military service
theyre both close in age were both promoted to general very young  its easy to see how such a vile mindset took root
but my lord brother certainly doesnt feel the same way about him
then thats all the more reason for general kempf to hate him wouldnt you say
what why if the hatreds not mutual there should be no reason for it to continue
hah you dont get it i envy your innocence its kempfs way of thinking that ensures north and south thracia will never be as one
i dont follow  whats that got to do with the north and south
 ah ive bent your ear for too long though its been good to speak so frankly why dont you stay a spell and catch your breath
i will thank you you spoil me general 
prince leif just across the valley is fort noel which guards the border between thracia and the empire
well finally be able to strike at the enemys own territory for a change  have we any idea of their numbers
our reports say that their garrison is small but they make up for it with force of arms the fort is guarded with ballistae a sort of giant bow that can fire across great distances theyre tremendously powerful well have to destroy them before advancing toward the fort otherwise capturing it will be impossible
how do you propose we do that
weve three means of attack first we could send the majority of our forces to attack the ballistae then send a small force to capture the fort while theyre occupied second we could storm the valley with all our forces at once overwhelming the ballistae with too many targets for them to be effective they both have their own crucial downsides 
whats the best course of action
that would be the third way surely youve caught on now that ive told you about the other two dont tell me you need it spelled out for you prince leif
lady olwen the valley is under attack you must ride for fort dandrum at once and warn them ill keep the enemy at bay
if youll permit it general i would rather remain here and fight alongside you
im honored lady olwen but we have our orders yours is reconnaissance and alerting fort dandrum must be your first priority
i cant just leave you here you must allow me to help you defend the valley if only for a little while 
 very well provided that you swear to leave the battlefield and ride for fort dandrum in short order
thank you general fred lets move out
hah theres the lady olwen i know
i can delay no longer  fort dandrum must be warned of this invasion general largo ill return with every able bodied soldier i can find you have my word 
whats the meaning of this why do you trespass on our rightful land
argh  so  this is how it ends 
i spit on your mercy invaders why not just take my head
invaders hear me you must leave imperial territory at once
you think you can just stomp around house frieges backyard and get away with it
general largo  the man was every bit the soldier he was made out to be
this was our first time fighting the troops of house friege  now that the battle is over i can almost admire how well they fought if this was the might of a skeleton crew manning a small border outpost i worry how fierce their full army will prove to be 
indeed house friege is one of the most prestigious families in all of jugdral they have a reputation to uphold to save themselves from any embarrassment even the most lowly rank and file soldiers are drilled in the ways of knighthood and honor their army throughout the rest of the continent will reflect this rigid discipline theyre a formidable enemy no doubt but you fought with the best of them prince leif your leadership this day was most admirable
ah  you mean how i had general largo captured instead of killed
indeed this holy war must be fought to the bitter end but fighting it with such mercy is what the late prince quan would have done i pray that you remain this just and forthright as our battles continue never forsake your knightly pride
knightly pride  huh i didnt really think of it in those terms i merely wanted to avoid a needless slaughter if i could
august did you see the mage knight that fled midway through the battle
indeed a woman knight at that she was a most difficult adversary
who was she
i didnt recognize her but theres little doubt she rode for fort dandrum to bring word of our incursion
so the enemy will know were coming 
just so and fort dandrum is no common encampment its regarded as impregnable even a permanent fixture of the region combine that with the advance warning weve given them and theyll have plenty of time to shore up their defenses even further the forts commander is surely no slouch hes certain to make the most of the extra time to prepare indeed i fear well have a most difficult time seizing the fort 
i see  still theres no other route that would allow us to cross the mountains
that seems to be the hand weve been dealt my prince if were to arrive at tarrah in time to act we must take fort dandrum
then theres little point standing around and complaining about it the longer we wait the stronger the forts defenses will be this is our only chance and well make the most of it
/***EOF***/
prince leif over here
august what are you doing here
planning your rescue but it seems that was unnecessary clearly youre safe and sound but  you look as if your mind is in great turmoil
ive never hated the empire more than i do in this moment august they snatched my parents from this world and now theyve taken my mother from me all over again  raydrik is little more than their hand committing untold evil at their behest augustus show me how to wage war against them ill  ill do anything to get her back just tell me what i need to do
 lady eyvel was turned to stone by some foul magic you say if that is indeed the case you  must accept that she is gone prince leif
wh what kind of talk is that isnt there some way to undo whats happened to her
well  there is a sacred artifact the staff of kia that can reverse the process of petrification yet the enemy is one step ahead of us long ago archbishop manfroy of the loptr church placed a seal upon the staff that prevents anyone not of his bloodline from using it
manfroys bloodline  so then 
this is mere rumor but it is said that a hidden shrine to loptous lies deep within the aed desert countless warriors who defied the loptians and were turned to stone are kept within its forbidden halls amongst them some say you can even find the young rebels who fell in the battle of belhalla so many years ago if true i imagine lady eyvels petrified form would also be kept there as a trophy
that  thats nonsense utter nonsense
is it what you call utter nonsense is the state of our world do you doubt how much power the loptr church holds look around you in the thracian peninsula alone thousands no tens of thousands of children have been seized and sent to belhalla in places where the churchs influence runs strong places like your native munster they possess near total authority throughout munster youll see nary a single child still free
do parents feel nothing when their children are stolen from them why arent they fighting this
of course the people fight this they resist however they can not just in munster but everywhere the empire has dominion but theyre simple folk with no real weapons they could never match the might of the imperial army let alone the loptr church any who do try are arrested and executed at best the cults elite unit of sorcerers the schwarze rosen use methods that are the very definition of cruelty they dont merely execute rebels they burn everyone in their village at the stake from all this the men and women of jugdral have lost their will to fight they are little more than slaves now make no mistake the dark age is upon us again
is there no end to their heartlessness 
north thracia was once defined by its clear skies and lush verdant fields but the land is now beset by dark clouds that blot out the sun  prince leif your loyalty to lady eyvel is admirable but a more important task stands before you north thracia needs a hero to rally behind someone who will reinvigorate the peoples will to fight and assemble them into an army call such heroism whatever you like whether through bravery or ingenuity you must rise above the obstacles before you prince leif you carry the blood of both the loyal quan and the just maiden ethlyn their strengths their deeds live on in you do you realize what that means if the heir to house leonster were to raise an army all those in north thracia who oppose the empire would unite behind him if such a thing were to occur perhaps  just perhaps the empire and loptians could be driven from thracia
i refuse to abandon the commander but  i understand your reasoning august if i could become the rallying figure for the liberation of thracia if i could rebuild leonster and lead its army to crush the empire  it would be nothing short of what finn and i have dreamed of for as long as i can remember august if you would join me as my tactician and advisor there is no hardship i would be unwilling to endure but  is defeating the empire even possible
yes but leave the details for another time for now we must focus on our escape though i must say prince leif i am gladdened to hear such resolve from you
theres no shortage of soldiers emerging to pursue us  is there any safe route out of here
going through the eastern side gate would be ideal but that would require making our way through the castle town  if anyone is spotted by the enemy theyll call for reinforcements making our escape that much more difficult
not be seen by the enemy im not sure how to avoid that 
if you want to avoid going through the town ive got your back hermes an i can fly everybody over the wall one by one no chance of being seen that way
thatll get us out of here without a fight but will you be all right karin
i can tell hermes is willing to tough it out for everybodys sake normally pegasi only let women so much as touch them somethin about men gets them spooked hermes is willing to give everyone a chance though hes a male pegasus so hes plenty strong enough to carry me an one extra
 then it seems we have a viable means of escape the question now becomes whether we should chance visiting the castle town
hey you all right ive heard the news youd better escape while you still can
if we wait just a little longer master ced should arrive to help us  that should make things easier
i do apologize for this bishop looks like all ive done is weigh you down
tell me something galzus you said you work for baron raydrik correct so why this girl of all people  what is she to you
 nobody
 whatever you say galzus i admit this is a bit much to handle on my lonesome but ill manage may the fortunes of war be generous to you my good man
i barely recognized you lass  never expected to see that face of yours again
good prince leif is still safe
hed better be after all the trouble it took to find him 
we must act as a decoy to ensure the princes escape everyone im  truly sorry to risk your safety like this but prince leif must survive no matter the cost i humbly ask for your cooperation
as if you even have to ask were with you sir ced
were nearly at our limit  im ordering a retreat it wont be long until the main body of the enemys forces break away to engage us
so the esteemed sellsword galzus finally graces us with his presence what in blazes took you so long
 what you got for me
see those prisoners there theyre making their escape and theyve proven quite  resilient earn your keep and use that sword arm of yours to deal with them
hah those whelps are hardly worth worryin about ill show you just how weak they are 
yer the folk that helped me grandson cliff aint ya im mighty thankful that sir ced has friends like yall to rely on if anybody asks ya didnt get this from me but  id like ya to have this here rapier dont be modest now take it
the magi helped me kid brother bowie escape to another village yall wouldnt know anythin about that wouldja  listen i dont know how i can ever thank ya not a dayll go by when i dont remember yer kindness but words are wind right look this here is a set of writings thats been handed down in me family fer as long as thereve been stars in the sky folk who read em get some kinda strange power but shoot we can hardly read anyhow itll help you moren itll ever help us
oh i been waitin fer ya bless you fer helpin me little sis leena  oh i know take this i found it tryin to uproot a tree from me backyard  gods know how long its been buried there but it looks like a page outta some history book or somethin i figure its gotta be somethin good but theres no way i deserve it moren yall
y yer the ones what saved me daughter emily oh i gotta find some way to thank ya proper  ah i know take a look at this its a medal fer chivalry an knightly valor been an heirloom in the family fer generations but it can be replaced my emily sure cant be though id like yall to have it if you aint worthy of this medal nobody is
hey i was waiting for you guys i heard you saved maphy my son thanks to you i was able to hide him in safe place along with the other children im hicks an axe knight of munster i was thinking it was about time to teach that reidric a lesson ill fight alongside you
me little sis bella told me yer the ones who helped her thanks be to ye were poorern dirt so there aint much i can give ye but i do got somethin i can part with if it please ye good folk this here is a flask of pure water theres enough in there fer ye to get a few uses outta it
baron raydrik we regret to report that prince leif has made it clear of the castle hes  escaped
and just what were you doing you idiots we had them trapped like rats and you still couldnt handle it
we  we offer our deepest apologies sire were truly sorry
your apologies are as empty as your brains clearly this requires a man of greater intellect  send for general aizenau and his knights immediately he is to lead his troops in pursuit of these upstart rebels if they escape into thracia proper theres no end to the trouble they could cause 
at once milord
hold what became of that girl  mareeta was it ive not seen her since this fiasco started 
 im aware of her fate baron raydrik but i  wished to inform you later when you were in a better mood  someone attacked the guards that were stationed and made off with her i  i cannot begin to express my apologies sire
 i swear ive never encountered a group of adults more incapable of being useful  do you buffoons even have a clue who this assailant was
theres no doubt they were quite skilled based on whats left of the guards  but one of our own claims to have seen that sellsword galzus near the site of the attack are you certain we can trust him
no  galzus 
whats more another man is sure hes seen a brand on galzuss back the mark of od to be specific though if thats true it would mean hes part of the isaachian royal family 
hmph im already aware of his heritage im not so foolish as to hire a sellsword without knowing everything about them he is indeed isaachian royalty cousin to prince shannan in fact with the deaths of his kin hes technically the prince of ribaut himself
b but prince shannan is one of the most influential rebel leaders are we to open this castle to a man who shares his blood
 i can see ill have to spell this out for you galzuss kin the royal family of ribaut betrayed their home kingdom of isaach and were killed for it the man leading the troops that defeated them was none other than shannans grandfather king mananan since then galzus has endured nothing but hardship from a very young age do you honestly think such a man would ever help the likes of shannan and his rebels
i see your point 
ah  then galzus would have every reason to free that girl wouldnt he she bore the brand of od on her back as well  heh heh heh 
uh sire
mm its nothing you need concern yourself with we cant do anything about the girl now but as for galzus our position is too vulnerable to risk losing him dont act against him unless i say otherwise
fate must really have it out for you makin your path cross mine 
hah so this is it  youre a  real fascinating sort  i was even  able  to  see 
/***EOF***/
the walled city of tarrah its shape tall and imposing stood before them on the horizon under the leadership of duchess linoan daughter of the late duke of tarrah the city had rebelled against the empire refusing to be complicit in their many crimes this rebellion had not gone unpunished the city had already been under siege by the imperial army led by colonel paulus for some time already in dire straits before the empires attack had even begun it would now be exceptionally difficult for tarrah to recover initially tarrah had brokered its freedom by agreeing to not interfere with the grannvale empires conquest of north thracia in exchange tarrah had been allowed to keep its autonomy but even at the time the citys freedom was thought to be as precarious and fleeting as a candle flickering in the wind 
hows our situation here general rist
we have the city surrounded colonel paulus i formally request that we begin our assault now
why the hurry baldack and the 8th battalion should be here shortly theres no need to overextend ourselves wed only be wasting good soldiers
i see as you wish colonel
hmph ill be damned if i just sit on my hands and let baldack rob me of all the glory all imperial forces begin the assault try to retreat and ill kill you myself go go go
the empires finally making their move  whats the plan glade
 the reality is that we cant match the strength of their army all we can do is postpone the inevitable
i could  i could take to the sky and scatter their front line i reckon that would buy you some time but 
dont you wouldnt make it far youd be easy pickings for their ballistae a dracoknights entire way of fighting is to swoop down strike and fly away all in one swift move thats how you stay alive eda impatience will just get you killed
all due respect brother but this isnt the place for a lecture time isnt on our side 
hmm  for the time being ill dispatch my cadre of knights to the field
but will your small band of knights be enough to stem the tide glade our sellswords have long since fled your men will have to go it alone
 we must call upon prince shannan the blood of the crusader od the sword saint himself runs strong in his veins my knights could never match his might on the battlefield  bah would that i knew why he refuses to help us
tch  that pompous little dastard he doesnt give a damn about the common folk our battles dont concern him i just dont understand that guy 
so he means to keep womanizing while the people of tarrah fight for their lives damned philanderer  he wont be any help we must fight the inevitable on our own then
dont push yourself glade the empires just getting started however this ends weve got a long way to go
yes  i know that
my prince take a gander just over those mountains the road has been long but may i present the city of tarrah  h how how is this possible the empire has already begun their assault
to arms then tell our forces to charge into tarrah we cant abandon the citys people
i i must object the main body of our army has only just now cleared the forest our vanguard is all that we have here thats to say nothing of the enemys many ballistae gods they practically have more ballistae than men to fire them  any of our forces that made for tarrahs defense now would face  more than their share of danger
 im aware of the risks but if we stand here and allow tarrah to be razed to the ground our war will be lost before its even begun are you in agreement august
i am if we do nothing to defend tarrah we lose the support of the people their belief in us will turn to contempt our army is still young and vulnerable without popular support we have nothing and our cause will fade into history forgotten
glade  a are you the knight glade sir
hm  prince leif it  it cant be 
hah is the mighty sir glade surprised so easily this is indeed prince leif in the flesh our sovereign lord and commander of house leonsters army by birthright the north thracian liberation army is also his doing and his to command
house leonsters army and the liberation army both  our prayers have finally been answered duke dryas
indeed glade our homeland of leonster shall live again ours will be the hands that release the people from the yoke of tyranny we will bear the flag of the gáe bolg and raise it once more over the land of njörun
hah  the day has finally come  prince leif  long have we mourned the ignoble deaths of king calf and prince quan the hopes of our people now rest with you please milord succeed your father and realize his will
i shall join me glade and well reclaim leonster
hah you neednt ask milord we sworn men of leonster would follow you through the gates of hell
glade youre all right
finn it feels like a lifetime since last we met  how long has it been
ten years the last time we stood together was at the battle for ulster 
thats right  and all this time youve been caring for prince leif youve done well old friend you have my deepest thanks truly
the feeling is mutual sir glade after all youve been no slouch yourself you have helped duke dryas raise the next generation of the lanzenritter and kept their name alive were it not for their aid i fear lord leif wouldnt have been able to come this far
i merely kept my word nothing more when last we were together we made a pact i to protect the banner of house leonster and you to protect prince leif we swore to defend them both with our lives
well looking around us id say weve finally achieved what we vowed so long ago to do our wards stand tall and ready to fight again ah but theres no rest for us knights is there yet another battle unfolds before us we cannot lose focus even for but a moment
indeed until the flag of the gáe bolg flies over leonster once again we must remain ever vigilant  but when that day finally comes old friend i want nothing more than to sit down with you and share a good brew for now though you must see to it that prince leif and his retinue make it inside tarrahs walls weve gotten word that one of house frieges battalions are due to arrive soon and its dangerous enough out here as it is
glade oh it does my heart a world of good to see you safe 
selphina  you came along too my beloved
of course prince leif heard that tarrah was in jeopardy and we set off together oh im truly grateful to be with you again 
im deeply sorry to have worried you ah but  selphina  yet again ive ordered many promising young knights to their deaths  i lament just how weak i am 
no my dearest you are the highest exemplar of a knight of leonster im proud to be your wife so please dont be so hard on yourself 
thank you selphina ah did the gods smile upon me the day that we met  and seeing you again here is enough to soothe my very soul ah i almost forgot here i want you to take a look at this
this is  ah how did you  a brave bow just like the ones in the legends
i came across it by chance during my time in tarrah i took the liberty of buying it for you for when we met again  will you use it
of course i will oh glade this is just splendid thank you
glade oh it does my heart a world of good to see you safe 
selphina  you came along too my beloved
of course prince leif heard that tarrah was in jeopardy and we set off together
hah so i saw i had the honor of meeting our liege himself earlier it amazes me just how much hes grown  we parted a decade ago at alster and now hes already a boy of 15 
i shared your shock when i reunited with him as well to think the toddler we knew so well has grown so tall 
 hes no longer a boy is he hes a man a fine young man he already bears a striking resemblance to prince quan
indeed i thought he bore more of a resemblance to his mother looking at him i could feel lady ethlyns grace once again 
truly ah but he must get his eyes from prince quan at least he has the same determined gaze as his father
oh nonsense he gets his eyes from lady ethlyn too she doted on me like a little sister and i remember her face all the better for it
all right all right point taken my dearest but theres no need to get worked up over it hes the child of them both after all its only natural that hed take after the two of them in a few different ways
ah  youve the right of it of course i beg your pardon its just that so many things remind me of lady ethlyn and i 
no i understand  lady ethlyn she  ive always wondered what she felt leaving her newborn son behind when she rode out that final fateful time with prince quan  do you think  was her heart plagued with regret to have left prince leif behind
i  i dont know i remember that when prince leif was still but a babe lady  lady altena used to be so jealous of him that was always a source of trouble for lady ethlyn yet despite that they were a lucky family and they all had a promising future my fondest wish back then was to be a mother as strong and wise as lady ethlyn when i came of age but then came that day in the aed desert  an act of treachery so foul it could be mistaken for a waking nightmare 
selphina 
i im sorry  i swore i would never cry again 
no its better to let it out now i  know that no mere trinket can begin to make up for what weve lost but  take a look at this bow selphina
this is  ah how did you  a brave bow just like the ones in the legends
i came across it by chance during my time in tarrah i took the liberty of buying it for you for when we met again  will you use it
of course i will oh glade this is just splendid thank you
t tarrah has fallen with the city crushed by the empire the people will surely turn against us  our war  is over
d damn i cant believe this
ugh  all the glory  the honor  that i worked for 
 l lord leif
linoan good i made it in time  just barely 
lord leif i  i can scarcely believe my eyes youve returned gods above i give thanks for your mercy 
 linoan you have my apologies i should have come here sooner despite all id heard i just couldnt fathom how the city id been raised in could be in such dire straits i share the blame for this  because of me your father 
no you have it all wrong from the moment he met you my father knew what sheltering you in tarrah would mean  he was prepared for the consequences if he could open the way to a new world with his death no one could have convinced him to do otherwise i am proud of my father and i stand by his decision despite the grief it brought me personally long have i endured the empires tyranny comforted by the belief that we would meet again and now that day has come and yet  to endanger myself is one thing but now ive imperiled the tens of thousands of people that call tarrah home i  i dont know what to do in the face of this crisis 
dry your eyes linoan fear not i swear upon my sword that ill protect both you and the city of tarrah

heeding augusts advice leif approached leonster from the south however this meant crossing through millefeuille the so called mirage forest leif would soon learn first hand how the area earned such an infamous nickname and why people went out of their way to avoid it 
this is the great forest of millefeuille a sprawling woodland deserving of the name mirage forest
mirage forest  so how do we proceed from here
if we can make it to the forests northeast edge castle leonster will be but a stones throw away but i suggest we bring up the rear so as to better keep an eye on the troops and ensure we dont lose anyone along the way
understood tell everyone to exercise extreme caution and not let their guard down for even a moment now lets get this over with forward march
is something amiss bishop rinecok
eheheheh  gaze into the crystal ball and have a look for yourself seems some fresh prey has wandered here
armed men  doubtless its count conomor of alster trying to rescue his precious princess miranda
bah not even conomor is that foolish no its probably the meager remnants of leonster trying to recapture their castle
ah they must have chosen to go through the forest to avoid our defenses on the western front  what a colossal blunder
its quite the boon for us really now we have something to kill time with gather every free hand and take up positions
at once bishop but what will you be doing sir
hah ill be taking the opportunity to  test this
ah thats the berserk staff this should be most interesting 
eheheheh

um  thank you sara
lady sara what are you doing in a place like this
who are you i dont know you
ah of course  you see i was a bishop of loptous once but the granddaughter of the archbishop would have no reason to know me
hmm  i see  well just get out of my way im looking for the voice of your master i must find it 
the voice of my master 
its such a beautiful voice  and its calling out to me for help 
uh  i is that so  wait if youre sara granddaughter of archbishop manfroy then you can use the staff of kaia  thats it
mm  bye bye salem
well well look who it is its been a while shannam
grk 
so this time youre a stooge for the loptians huh guess you dont discriminate when it comes to employers
h hey  i dont like doing this you know look im out of coin  i dont have a choice
uh huh well suit yourself it doesnt make any difference to me what you do
hey wait wherere you going you cant just leave me here you gotta help me out i mean were friends right
like i said it makes no difference to me what you do if you want to tag along its no skin off my back
really wow i owe you one  thanks a bunch
youre not like the real prince at all ugh 
you trespass upon land belonging to loptous himself fools 
o lord  i beg for your  divine  intervention 
ive nothing to say to you 
h hey wait lets talk about this 
ngh  what a stupid way  to 
you have my thanks for now hah 
what are you doing do you  not like me
i feel so  alone 
that was  boring
somehow we managed to escape  but to think there was a loptian monastery in a place like this  this entire battle was born of my negligence the failure is mine 
dont let it weigh too heavily on you youre not all knowing after all still this place has certainly lived up to its reputation though we proved up to the challenge
is this  a monastery of the loptian order the mages and bishops seem to have all fled 
prince there was a woman being held captive inside the monastery she wishes to see you
very well bring her to me
prince leif  its been a long long time 
 and you are
you ask me that oh so thats how it is  youve forgotten me have you im miranda of alster
miranda  the princess princess of alster how can that be why are you here
did you not recognize me bah i suppose its no surprise considering the sorry state im in  i must look like some common wretch but before you get caught up on how unsightly i look remember that all of this is your fault prince
my fault why
all of this began when leonster fell my lord father was a gentle man who hadnt the heart for battle and he knew there was little sense in fighting the empire but nevertheless he took you in sheltered you from the empire and in so doing invited their wrath he had to turn me over to them as a hostage and forfeit his own right to the throne and in the end he departed this world in a state of utter misery  i cannot forgive you prince if youd never come to alster things wouldnt be like this 
  
 princess miranda i must beg to differ the empire planned to conquer alster all along prince leifs presence was merely a convenient excuse to do so not to speak ill of the dead princess but your father was too timid he had knights of the highest caliber at his command yet when thracia invaded he sat on the fence instead of joining the fight and despite being a sworn ally of leonster when our kingdom was in crisis he sent no troops to our aid he simply reaped what he sowed your father himself is to blame for your kingdom falling into ruin shifting the blame to prince leif is pure selfishness
enough dorias nothing good will come of talk like that
hrm  i went too far i admit please accept my apologies 
you have my apologies as well princess miranda i must beg your forgiveness  had i known you were being held captive here i wouldve come to your aid as fast as my legs could carry me i cant imagine how difficult it was for you being imprisoned here for so long 
 well admittedly i havent been imprisoned in this dreary monastery the whole time until last year i was being kept in alster count conomor watched over me from afar and i was comfortable enough but then came the insurrections in tahra and leonster  that stoked the fires of revolution and even in alster a contingent of the people plotted rebellion evidently the empire feared their position was becoming too vulnerable and so i was moved to this dreadful place
ah  well even one year is far too long to spend in a place like this
prince leif if you werent lying about wanting my forgiveness you must lend me your strength i must reclaim alster  i must undo my fathers regrets and give meaning to his meaningless death
/***EOF***/
wheres rist i dont see him anywhere 
i bring word of his fate he charged into battle early and was defeated by the rebels right now hes either dead or in chains
the poor sod  i almost pity him
if i may speak freely sir rist brought it upon himself when he disobeyed your orders
 im not so sure of that i was opposed to this whole plan and now my hesitation has cost a great many soldiers their lives the blame is mine alone i must make quite a sight the great colonel paulus reduced to an old man whose glory days are long past him go ahead and laugh baldack
colonel 
but i cannot allow myself to hesitate for one moment longer i am a knight of house friege and i have a duty to uphold will you lend me your strength baldack
of course colonel paulus i await your orders whats more the main body of the 8th battalion has arrived with your permission well begin our assault at once
permission granted ill have my own troops move to reinforce your position just as soon as my men have finished their preparations  see that you dont get sloppy general i imagine that goes without saying but still keep your guard up
ill remain vigilant colonel on my honor tarrah will fall this day
 its started lady linoan
and so the empire brings the full weight of their army to bear against us  what is lord leif doing now
meeting with the other commanding officers and military officials
is dean with them
brother said he wasnt the type to sit around in some war council he left to go defend the southern gate hes always been headstrong like that 
heh that much i already know dean has been watching over me since i was very young you see he always reminded me of the stories of the crusader dáinn the legendary dracoknight he may lack for etiquette but hes always been the sort to fly freely through the skies untroubled by the worlds petty squabbles  hes a towering loud mouthed man true yet hes still gentle in his own way and above all he is a master of the skies undefeatable in battle just like dáinn
i  think youve been misled lady linoan my brother is not the exemplar among men you believe him to be
i beg to differ hes not perfect granted but had he not come to my aid my spirit would have been broken long ago and i would be useless to the city now after my father was killed the ducal mansion was seized and i was forbidden to even set foot outdoors on my own for two years i was kept prisoner in my own home and for all that time the wretched governor sent by the empire interrogated me about where prince leif was to this day just the thought of that disgusting man is enough to make my heart stop  dean  he saved me from that after the deed was done he protected me from the empires assassins and when my grief felt too heavy to bear he was always ready to bring a smile to my face it was strange  he always kept up a cheery demeanor but behind the facade i could tell he mustve been a renowned sellsword never would i have suspected that he answered to lord arion himself 
 theres more to it than that his highness prince arion was worried sick about the crisis unfolding in tarrah and secretly arranged for dean to rescue you i remember brother being so honored by the trust his highness had placed in him  ive never seen him happier but it wasnt without its cost to preserve the secrecy of his mission brother had to make it look like hed simply deserted from the army
lord arion really went to such lengths 
his highness was caught between a rock and a hard place he couldnt leave thracia but he couldnt sit back and let his own fiancée die  his highness seemed deeply tormented  openly so during the whole ordeal but fear not lady linoan dáinn and njörun have bore witness to your compassion and grace and they will not forsake you  its time i need to set off for the front lines please milady wait here and stay safe have faith that we will be victorious today
hey whats with the getup you planning to skip town
hmph  theres no point in stickin around here 
oh cmon the folks around here only put up with you because they wanted your help so badly everybodys gonna have it out for you if you run out on them now especially the women hell hath no fury and all that
n no its not like that im the prince of a whole different country and i cant just leave my people without their beloved leader
uh huh yeah if youre the prince of isaach im saint heim i can see right through you
hrk  how did you know
im a bard remember i know what prince shannan looks like and you aint him still its not like i can blame you i mean who wouldnt want to save their own skin no sense in getting dragged down with the rest of the city if you can avoid it
so youre making a run for it too
thats the plan im hightailing it outta here first thing in the morning gives me plenty of time to have my fun tonight heheh
yeah you do that me im gettin out while i still can if you make it through this alive maybe well cross paths again someday
one last thing now that were acquainted you at least gotta tell me your real name
   its shannam
thats  closer to the real thing than i was expecting well safe travels prince shannam
its almost time  i trust youre aware of my plans makroy officially were the empires allies here to lend a helping hand to their little conquest keep the imperial army believing that but only help them as little as possible just enough to make it look like were being loyal
 and when the empires forces have exhausted themselves we turn on them and seize tarrah for ourselves
exactly tarrah is the most important card we can play against bloom  see that you dont damage the city too much in all the fighting
im aware of the stakes your majesty leave everything to me
my lord father doesnt attacking tarrah only serve to benefit the empire tarrahs citizens are united in their hatred of the empire if we come to their aid now it could pave the way for a new alliance between us
hah you think shackling ourselves to tarrah would be enough to triumph over the empire have you already forgotten our defeat at melgen we had all of north and south thracia united under our rule then and we were still no match for the empire
 we lost only because raydrik betrayed us
maybe so maybe so  but the fact remains that the battle ended with us humiliated and having to resort to suing for peace north thracia the land i had gone through so much to finally regain was taken from me all over again all those years  for nothing as it stands its no exaggeration to say that the empires might exceeds our own by tenfold you still like those odds you still think you can win a whole lot of people will die imperials thracians tarrans theyll all bleed just the same you still want to go through with your plan
n no  youve the right of it my lord father i was  being too rash  but if i may father i have a request
sigh what
i wish to help you seize tarrah
 youre up to something arent you well so be it as long as this wealthy city falls into thracias hands i dont give a damn how you do it i give you leave to act as you see fit
i wont let you down thank you my lord father
just make sure you dont take too long i can only keep up this ruse for so much longer and id rather not use my main body of troops to seize tarrah if i can avoid it
of course father if things keep going the way they are countless innocent civilians will perish  i must convince linoan no matter what 
linoan where are you its me its arion
lord arion wh what are you doing here
theres no time you must listen to me tell your people to lay down their arms and surrender immediately if you keep fighting like this tarrah will never recover from this battle its fate will be sealed
why  why would i do such a thing this isnt something id ever imagined hearing from you  just what in blazes has happened
my lord father is planning to seize tarrah for himself hes prepared a massive army to take the city from the empire once their forces are exhausted
no 
it gets worse sorcerers of the loptr church are headed here even as we speak and not just any sorcerers theyve sent the schwarze rosen the withered roses of loptous himself when they arrive here theyll slaughter every single man woman and child in tarrah it will be genocide
the schwarze rosen  this was my greatest fear 
linoan you must trust me allow thracia to occupy tarrah we can place the citys people under our protection and ill see to it theyre treated well the empire wont be able to harm them being under thracian rule also means the city wont be forced to participate in child hunts  and isnt that what you wanted all along of course i wont allow anything to happen to you either you have my word that ill protect you just as vigilantly linoan
what will become of lord leif and the other knights
im afraid theyll have no choice but to flee the city the empire cannot allow the prince to escape and father fears him as a threat
 i understand your highness i shall avail myself of your kind offer and entrust the city of tarrah to you
youve made a wise decision linoan
but i wont be staying here myself i shall accompany lord leif it pains me to abandon the citizens whove stood by me for so long during our rebellion but i believe this would be best for everyone once the empire lies destroyed at the hands of lord leif and myself ill return home when that day comes your highness do you promise to return tarrah to my rule
you  plan to overthrow the empire ill agree to those terms if you can truly defeat the empire ill gladly return tarrah to you
is prince leif worthy of such confidence i wonder is the boy really up to such a monumental task as fighting the empire will he grow to be thracias ally or its greatest nemesis  i hope that im able to meet him one of these days  together with altena
oh ho ho  i like what i see ill clear my whole schedule to make time for you darling
i beg your pardon whats the meaning of this 
ysee hun this is my last night in town would that i could make love to all my admirers but alas im only one man yowch hey hey hey whatd you hit me for
what are you thinking all the people of the city young and old are fighting tooth and nail for tarrah but here you are already halfway through a bottle of wine before noon have you no shame
h hey sweetheart dont get that pretty face all wet with tears  sigh all right all right i get it i suppose i can lend you a hand  just remember that im a lover not a fighter this body of mine enchanting as it may look isnt built for heavy labor
beat it kid im trying to catch an afternoon nap cant stay looking good if you let a little ol war get in the way of your beauty sleep 
hmm  a man huh im not quite in the mood for that today but please do come see me another time
well what have we here hmm  tempting but im saving all my strength for later tonight im gonna have my hands plenty full then
ah sir dean lady altena has been waiting here for you
its been too long dean im glad to see youre doing well
lady altena what in dáinns name are you doing here
heh  you havent changed a bit dean ive come all this way to give you a gift a spear worthy of your service to thracia
th this is no mere spear  this is his highness prince arions personal weapon the dragonpike why would he give me such a prized possession
he considered it a token of his apology for having to brand you a deserter as part of your cover go on take it he said he wanted you to put it to good use
i was the one who chose to desert the army sure it was to carry out his highness secret mission but i couldve said no i made the decision not him and i knew what it would mean for me his highness is not to blame so as flattered as i am i cant accept this
dont disregard my brothers feelings so easily dean he thought just as much about this as you did about deserting the army  besides if you wont accept his gift willingly then as princess of thracia ill just order you to accept it
hah  you know technically im not a knight of thracia anymore so you actually couldnt order me to do anything but youve made your point lady altena order or no you know i could never refuse you ill wield the dragonpike for a time but im only borrowing it thats all
im glad you understand now use the dragonpike to protect linoan make sure nothing happens to her linoan and brother are betrothed after all  he wanted to come here and defend linoan himself but couldnt risk leaving the kingdom unguarded for too long  i suppose giving you his spear was his way of being here in spirit
im supposed to be a stand in for his highness himself awfully big shoes hes asking me to fill  i think youve got the wrong idea lady altena no way am i the man for that kind of honor ill do my best though now dont you worry another minute about duchess linoan ill guard her with my life
so  this is how im to die 
king bloom i beg of you  ive  seen what will happen  its not  too late 
you have my gratitude yet our defeat is my responsibility 
funny you little rats think you can actually beat me
wh what tomfoolery  how  could  this 
/***EOF***/
the scion of light and lord of house chalphy seliph 
lord seliph we should head back soon 
ah julia are we out of time already i wish we could keep talking prince leif but i must be going leave the conquest of conote to us i bid you go straight to manster
i pray you forgive my selfishness lord seliph
nonsense youre not being selfish at all i understand your feelings perfectly you can head to munster with a clean conscience ill see you soon
yes in munster you can count on it
ill be praying for your health lord leif  if your fortune begins to wane perhaps one of your own clerics could appeal to the gods i believe theres a church on your route  it was built to receive the prayers of the ducal family of tarrah as i recall 
thank you lady julia just dont forget to take care of yourself too
how went your meeting with lord seliph my prince
he and i are only a year apart but hes such an incredible man 
indeed he commands an army ten times the size of ours and he was able to lead them across the aed desert hes certainly not your ordinary youth 
but you said before that he was made into a hero did you not
i did say that yes and in one sense its true but im not discounting that lord seliph himself possesses outstanding talent i suspect hell eclipse the legend of his father lord sigurd by quite some measure
and meanwhile im still just an embarrassment to leonster 
youve grown much over the past year my prince in another year i expect youll be the same caliber of man as lord seliph now putting that aside what did you and he agree would be the plans for our armies going forward
lord seliphs main forces will go east along the shore to seize conote as planned
which frees our army to head for fort danzig correct
indeed lord seliph readily granted my request leaving conote to seliph means we can focus all our energy on seizing munster i want to head there as soon as possible
well have to claim fort danzig regardless it controls the inland route to munster
the army stands ready prince leif we await your command
then theres no time to lose we storm fort danzig
everybody remembers we fight for pay right so dont be a hero wait for the enemy to break up their forces then swoop in until then nobody leave their post
ah  youre duchess linoan of tarrah are you not
hm how do you know who i am
i grew up with your father he and i didnt know each other particularly well but i was also good friends with your late mother i nearly mistook you for her when you walked in the resemblance is uncanny
oh  is that so 
oh heavens i didnt mean to upset you er  i take it youre with prince leif i saw you fighting together outside
i am with the liberation army yes
mm  it seems the blood of the crusaders is drawn to conflict 
blood of the crusaders you dont mean  i have holy blood
eh your father didnt tell you the ducal house of tarrah is descended from saint heim the first of the grannvale kings
i have  the blood of saint heim 
you mean to say you never realized you bore the power of naga herself  follow me i can awaken the holy blood that lay dormant in your veins
very well
the fighting will only become more intense as you draw closer to the imperial base to the east keep hold of this pure water im sure it will come in handy
on my honor as a soldier ill defend this fort to the end
ugh  i regret  i  couldnt 
so i  made it out alive but what am i going to do now 
soldiers of leonster prepare yourselves
your majesty  im sorry  i  couldnt 
how am i ever gonna make it up to his majesty 
august this cant be an ordinary fort there are too many guards for that
by the look of it this place is being used as a prison camp the enemy has likely started executing prisoners because of our attack
what then theres not a moment to lose we have to rescue the prisoners
our forces are already exhausting themselves prince leif besides we have intelligence that a battalion of loptian mages are en route please we need to withdraw while we can
no august i wont ill not abandon my comrades in arms to the enemys clutches ill free them alone if i have to
sigh i suppose this is unavoidable  at least limit yourself to a small handful of troops and let the others rest
anything of import inside the fort august
hmm  the fort is completely vacant seems to be deserted by the look of it this place was once a prison camp but its not in use anymore
i see then if theres nothing requiring our attention we should hurry ahead to the river thracia once we cross it well be at munsters doorstep
hah  easier said than done my prince ive no doubt the enemy is waiting for us they likely have established a defensive line at the river we still have some way to go before our goal see that you dont let your guard down
/***EOF***/
raydrik proved to be even more useless than i thought  well if you want something done right best do it yourself
veld  explain yourself
archbishop manfroy wh when did you get here your eminence
spare me your sniveling formalities why is killing one person a child need i remind you so difficult for you the leonster heir has humiliated you at every turn
im deeply sorry your eminence ill claim prince leifs head before the day is over i assure you
see that you do otherwise it will be your head that hangs from the castle gates more than just this battle is riding on the boys death  if he lives all our efforts to incite war in thracia and assassinate prince quan will be for nothing
im amazed the ruse has held for this long frankly the fools still think travant was behind it all
eheheheh i almost pity the thracians in the depths of their ignorance  did it never occur to them that travant had no way of knowing when quans forces would march or what route they would take capitalizing on travants ambitions to make north and south thracia tear each other apart  everything happened exactly as you predicted it would
im honored by your words your eminence 
but its simply given way to a new problem you underestimated the leonster heir did you not it would have been best to nip him in the bud and kill him when castle leonster first fell when he was little more than an infant 
it is true that prince leif has brought all the rebellious children of north thracia together in one organized revolt  but if we strike them down now when they all act as one and their morale is at its highest their spirits will be broken and in my defense the boy has done us a great service by defeating so many of house frieges battalions without realizing it hes eliminated one of the few military powers that couldve threatened our rule besides while he may be leonsters heir hes a mere child without enough holy blood to so much as lift the gáe bolg himself hes a posturing rebel whos deluded himself into thinking hes a real prince he cannot hope to triumph against me
hmm  you make a good case for yourself veld very well i shall grant you a second chance and as a token of my favor i bestow upon you five of my finest creations the deadlords
im most grateful your eminence combined with the one i just finished crafting that makes for a total of six  now the barrier will be impenetrable
then ill leave you to it veld i trust youll be along shortly to bring me the good news 
i wont fail you your eminence
is everyone ready august
all of our troops understand the plan small squads have each been stationed in front of every altar let us hope theyre all capable of defeating the horrors that lurk within 
i know they are everyone is aware of whats at stake the seals inside each of the six altars have to be broken to open the way to veld
its more complicated than that my prince one of our men must stand upon the center of an altar to break its seal each of the six altars must have one of our soldiers standing on its center all at once for the barrier to be dispelled hrm  i fear reinforcements will arrive if we take too long to coordinate this you need to prepare yourself to sacrifice some of our troops if it means getting rid of the barrier more quickly
i understand  but lets hope that wont be necessary come on lets end this
ah what it cant be  have those children broken through the seal ngh  leif you heathen  youre an impudent brat standing in the way of the divine ill send you to oblivion to meet your parents but not before you spend a century or two decorating my altar as a petrified statue
heh heh heh  you dare to cross me dont you know the power i wield let me show you just what a grave mistake youve made
gah  this is my  own folly  but  this isnt the end  even if you kill me loptous is eternal  and the rebirth of his empire is nigh i may die here  but youll struggle and flounder for the rest of your days  heh heh heh  eheheheheheh 
forgive me archbishop manfroy  ugh 
we  won  is it  really over
it is breathe easy my prince your long fight has at last come to an end with your victory today the loptians influence in north thracia has been eradicated at long last the thracian people have been liberated from the tyranny of loptous and his mortal servants this is all because of your perseverance and strength my prince you never gave up
no august  the people have you to thank as well without your guidance i never wouldve made it this far i started this journey knowing nothing and you taught me how to be a ruler i thank you august as a monarch and as your student i was truly fortunate to have met you 
this is  i  im not sure what to say  i need to tell you something my prince i would be a poor teacher if i continued to keep secrets from you now  it was not by chance that our lives intersected in fact i only became your tactician because i was ordered to do so by my benefactor truth be told at the outset i thought liberating north thracia was an impossible task but as i spent more time by your side as i saw how focused you were on freeing your motherland how earnestly you wanted it  before i knew it i had genuinely begun to believe in you i hope you can forgive me for all the times i doubted you
ill not lie august  the times when you voiced skepticism of my abilities did always weigh heavily on my heart yet you also taught me how to expand my perspective to realize the depth of everyones suffering and sorrow my upbringing strange and sheltered as it was left me lacking the tools to understand the lives of my subjects and i think i still have even more to learn  i need you august id be honored if you stayed by my side and continued to teach me
ah  as you wish it my prince so shall it be
lord leif a messenger just arrived from lord seliph conote has been seized by his army
huh conote has already fallen what of lord seliph 
hes alive and well milord fear not the message said that he rides for munster as we speak to help us capture the city i imagine word has not yet reached him of our victory he should be in for a most welcome surprise when he arrives
i can hardly believe it  for lord seliph to conquer such a formidable fortress as castle conote in a single day  my only regret is that i couldnt kill king bloom with my own hands
i sympathize milord but as regrets go you could have ended today with far worse remember north thracia is now free again in the streets of munster everyone young and old celebrates the victory of the liberation army the people cheer your name they shout that thracia has been liberated by the son of the late hero quan
finn  weve been through so many long and painful days havent we but however hard i had it you had it so much worse  you possess more patience and endurance than anyone ive ever known youve been there for me my whole life whenever i felt overwhelmed i knew i could always rely on you finn you sacrificed everything to raise me its like i spent my whole childhood sitting on your lap  how can i ever repay you
l lord leif  of the four kingdoms of north thracia leonster ulster conote and munster none save leonster have a surviving male heir hence the people want to be united under your rule no others remain who could take the throne lord leif  please fulfill their hopes be the answer to their prayers the tragedy of thracia is that these small kingdoms have been doomed to repeat their petty civil wars time and time again unify thracia and build a single prosperous kingdom as the land once was in the days of dáinn and njörun doing so was the dream of your late father lord quan and if you truly wish to repay me milord it is what i would ask of you as well
i would move the heavens themselves for you finn of course ill do as you ask ive come this far i wont start running now i have a duty to protect north thracia unifying all of thracia will depend on the will of king travant but ill do everything in my power to make it happen i know thats not ideal but  would that be enough to repay you finn
its  all i could have dreamed of lord leif
guess thats the end of this whole mess  hard to believe this all started with raydrik kidnapping little nan and mareeta huh ah little lord  it breaks my heart to do this but me and some of the others have got to head back to fiana
what youre not coming with me eyvel why would you do that
we may have kicked the loptians out but theres still lots of pirates around i cant just leave fiana and iz to fend for themselves besides how useful do you think wed be youve got a whole army of knights and mages and priests now you dont need us
but  eyvel 
little lord ill be looking forward to the day when you beat the empire for good and come back to leonster when that day comes not if but when ill bring everybody to leonster to celebrate
 id like that all right eyvel its a deal i promise ill come back and you promise to have everyone ready to celebrate but you might be waiting for a while so please be patient with me 
i dont think well be waiting for long actually i believe in you little leif go show the empire what its like to have you for an enemy
prince leif somethings been on my mind for a little while
princess miranda whats wrong
i  i owe you an apology
if this is about dryas what happened was my fault youre not to blame for it princess miranda and if you havent heard ulster was liberated by lord seliphs army im sure your people will be glad to know youre alive and well
uh thats  thats delightful to hear but  frankly my people want more than just to see me again they want to unify with leonster my senior vassals and statesmen are all advising that i wed you theyve been nagging me about it for quite some time actually those bloviating imbeciles think they can boss me around just because im a woman 
well out of the royal families of north thracias four kingdoms you and i are the only survivors they cant be the only people thinking this way but even so i still 
do you not like me prince if thats the case ill get over it but 
no its not that simple i just  ive still got things left to do the battle to unify thracia has just begun the loptr church and grannvale empire are still threats and north thracia needs protecting right now i just dont have the time to figure out if i truly love someone or not 
   then i shall return to ulster to await your answer but if you dont manage to defeat travant and south thracia consider my offer of marriage withdrawn
lord leif 
linoan ah  i imagine this must be very bittersweet for you  north thracia has returned to our rightful hands but tarrah remains in thracias clutches you know ill stop at nothing to recapture the city so wont you travel with me for a while longer
of course i will lord leif
duchess linoan though it pains me to say it i cannot go with you
how can that be deen why cant you
thracia is my motherland north and south shall soon face each other in battle and i cannot fight against my home you should stay with the prince linoan hell protect you from now on
deen  how can you say such a thing  i  i couldnt bear to go on without you
linoan 
i will abandon my plans to retake tarrah if it means you would stay dean so please remain at my side 
dont say something so stupid linoan this isnt like you at all ah dammit  now that i think about it id be hurting both prince leif and my sworn lord if i left with things the way they are now i have to avoid that no matter what it takes 
  
now look here little lady youve just got to say it right now
b but 
if you dont say it now youll only regret it or are you comfortable with staying the cute little sister forever
but mareeta 
ugh youre just going in circles im getting impatient  hey leif
what is it mareeta gah whats got you looking so  grim
go on nanna you can do it
l lord leif 
oh nanna there hasnt been a chance for just the two of us to talk i wanted to thank you youve been just as big a help as anyone and i wanted to make sure you knew how grateful i am
you give me too much credit  i hardly did anything at all
i think not we were raised like siblings and youve always been there for me nanna you were always there to support me to comfort me when i needed it and i wouldnt have fought half as well if i didnt have you to keep my spirits up when this is all over ill go looking for lachesis and if i find her ill tell her ive fallen in love with your daughter nanna i humbly ask for your blessing to wed her
ah  lord leif 
i know we have a long way to go before our battle is over but i hope youll stay by my side nanna
of  of course i will im honored lord leif 
prince leif lord seliph is here to see you
it seems my reinforcements were unnecessary im relieved to see you safe prince leif
lord seliph were only here because you intervened at leonster the credit for this victory is yours
no north thracia was liberated by you prince with your own strength i merely played a momentary role nothing more all of north thracia is agreed on uniting under your rule it seems if a country that vast and wealthy were to join the fight against the empire my liberation army would have cause for celebration prince leif will you continue to fight alongside me theres still much left to be done but if we were to join forces i know we could overcome any challenge in our way if you would accept it i offer you a vow of eternal friendship to live and die as one just as our fathers vowed before us
im honored to accept your oath after all weve been through i think of you less as a cousin and more as an older brother nothing could make me happier than the idea of pooling our strength to create a brighter future for everyone
then let us swear it upon this sword we may have been born apart but we shall die as one as your friend as your sworn brother we shall join hands and deliver jugdral from this evil this i vow to you
and i vow just the same to you an undying oath and may the stars themselves perish before it is broken
thus leifs battle which started in the remote village of fiana and ended with the liberation of north thracia came to a close yet although leifs battle had ended the war for jugdral has just begun in south thracia travants kingdom has already amassed great power in the grannvale empire crown prince julius the scion of darkness and incarnation of loptous is still alive and well now in year 777 of the grannvale calendar the world stands on the brink of a new era

prince youve got no idea who that snake really is  ah dammit all 
/***EOF***/
having overcome countless obstacles leif finally stood before the gates of castle munster better known today as the twofold traitors lair the castle towered above the city intimidating the liberation army with its sheer size once leif had fled these very walls as a mere fugitive but now he returned as a conqueror he stood ready to rescue a lost loved one and in so doing usher in a new era 
raydrik do i hear correctly that youve allowed those rebels to invade the castle
ah  if your eminence would grant me more time ill see to it that the vermin are wiped out
dont promise more than youre capable of its obvious to anyone with eyes that the rebels have the overwhelming advantage
  
even for you this is pathetic i thought youd at least be more useful than this but it seems i overestimated you i wash my hands of you raydrik our alliance has come to an end
wait bishop veld please if you abandon me now i  i 
not above begging are we oh very well  ill consider this a dead mans last request i shall spare you a battalion of sorcerers from the esteemed schwarze rosen
dont let your guard down prince there arent many of raydriks men left but hes made up the difference by hiring a slew of sellswords the most dangerous of them all is a swordsman by the name of galzus challenging him directly is suicide
galzus you say hmm  what should we do about him then
our only option is to lure him close enough for me to ambush him with the tome of forseti yet even i dont know if that will defeat him 
we barely have enough troops to stage such a diversion  august why did you insist on splitting our army in three
divide and conquer of a sort the second group is to rescue the children and the third will arrest the loptian bishops as their tasks are a race against time that was all the more reason to send them in ahead of us
rescuing the children goes without saying but why bother with the loptian bishops
theres a place of worship in the east wing of the castle where the loptians congregate the bishops there pose a grave threat to our army as they wield berserk and sleep staves
i see  so the task of defeating raydrik falls solely to our group then
indeed there wont be time for the others to circle back around and rejoin us
were certainly in for a difficult battle prince leif  leave the weaker foes to me you just focus on raydrik
understood no matter what it takes ill cut him down
raydrik has few soldiers left prince but stay alert more sellswords yet await us in the castles halls the most dangerous of them all is a swordsman by the name of galzus challenging him directly is suicide
galzus you say hmm  what should we do about him then
i cant guarantee this but if you still have that young woman mareeta with you we may be able to avoid fighting him altogether galzus appears to have some sort of deep bond with the girl 
then mareeta could be wait august why did you insist on splitting our army in three
divide and conquer of a sort the second group is to rescue the children and the third will arrest the loptian bishops as their tasks are a race against time that was all the more reason to send them in ahead of us
rescuing the children goes without saying but why bother with the loptian bishops

i see  so the task of defeating raydrik falls solely to our group then
indeed there wont be time for the others to circle back around and rejoin us
this moment was inevitable  were certainly in for a difficult battle prince leif but remember youre not alone ill do everything in my power to help you just focus on raydrik
understood no matter what it takes ill cut him down
raydrik has nearly run out of men my prince but take heed countless sellswords yet await us in the castles halls
if raydrik still has so many troops why did you insist on splitting our army in three
divide and conquer of a sort the second group is to rescue the children and the third will arrest the loptian bishops as their tasks are a race against time that was all the more reason to send them in ahead of us
rescuing the children goes without saying but why bother with the loptian bishops

i see  so the task of defeating raydrik falls solely to our group then
indeed there wont be time for the others to circle back around and rejoin us were certainly in for a difficult battle my prince but weve been in worse situations i know you have the strength to prevail
i do no matter what it takes ill cut raydrik down
its you  the swordsman that rescued me  i always hoped id see you again
whatd you come back here for youre still just a little girl  swords aint toys you know
back then when i was possessed by that cursed blade i had a vision of my father we were separated when i was very young but i still remember him clearly he was a towering mountain of a man strong as an ox and yet  gentle galzus the sellsword  youre  its you youre my father
ah 
why arent you saying anything please please just answer me
i  you dont blame me 
im the one to blame  those slavers only caught hold of me because i didnt listen to you besides i wasnt their prisoner for very long commander eyvel rescued me just after it happened i never held a grudge against you father
 im sorry i searched for a long long time but you never turned up  besides with the man i am now  with all the blood ive got on my hands  i figured it was better if you didnt have anything to do with me wherever you were
just like that  it doesnt matter whats happened since then well always be family 
  that lady the swordswoman who got turned to stone  shes the one who rescued you from those slavers right the one whos raised you ever since
thats right 
  then theres no way im leavin her behind a man of isaach always repays his debts
huh this door sure is strange aint it
oh uh  i guess its busted  heeey guys wait for meee
i saw your grandfather die i watched your fathers castle burn i outlived them and ill outlive you
ugggh  this is  absurd  how could  these  children  bishop veld  i beg of you  i dont want  to die  help  me 
fate must really have it out for you makin your path cross mine 
ugh  mareeta  im 
tch  being at the mercy of an enemy  ive fallen so far 
we fought for every inch but castle munster is ours bards will sing of this battle for years to come
but is raydrik really dead august after the finishing blow was dealt his body just vanished
some wicked force is at work here of that i have no doubt the whole castle is enveloped in a foul energy  i suspect its connected to the secret temple of the loptr church which lies underneath this very castle until that vile place is reduced to rubble we cannot consider munster truly liberated
a secret temple  so this is the loptians stronghold in thracia
indeed the man in charge of the temple is a bishop named veld hes a close friend and confidant to manfroy himself
bishop veld  what kind of man is he
he leads the parish of loptians that infest thracia with their presence it is his responsibility to oversee the regions child hunts and to sic the schwarze rosen on any villages who resist raydrik was little more than velds pawn and according to the prisoners weve rescued since it was he who turned lady eyvel to stone
wh what thats  thats unforgivable this man veld  hes the spider at the center of it all 
speaking of which august  now that eyvels rescue is within our grasp what can we do to cure her
as i mentioned before the staff of kia could free her but only those of manfroys bloodline can wield it were no closer to finding a solution to that dilemma than when we first fled castle munster 
so after all this were still just as powerless we cant save eyvel  argh  was all this just a waste
nothings been wasted silly im right here ill use the staff
sara  you dont mean  how can you use the staff
because i know how the seal works i mean it was grandfather that sealed it up in the first place so 
grandfather  it cant be  sara youre manfroys granddaughter
dont make me talk about grandfather  i never liked him he was such a weird man lets just hurry up and save your friend dont forget the staff lord leif
/***EOF***/
i shouldnt have to say this lifis but dont you dare lay a hand on the cleric
oh uh  r right got it
you could stand to give me the time of day safy we both know i could get anything you want just go along with me yeah
i have given my word to see lady linoans hopes realized unless you wish to join us in fighting for tarrah i will not falter
t take up arms against the empire may as well stand on the shore an try to push the tide back
perhaps it sounds impossible but the alternative is to do nothing as innocent children are ritually slaughtered no matter the cost no one with a drop of humanity could stand by and allow this to continue were not naïve everyone knows the risks we know well likely die but this isnt just about us this is bigger than one city or one society this is about resisting the grip of damnation itself loptous beckons lifis the world hurtles ever closer toward his jaws tarrah is the only place in jugdral still in dispute where will you be when history is written
well  i  look youre out to fulfill your ladys hopes right if i say yes will you fulfill one of my own hopes
if it is within my power i will
its a deal ill talk to my boys make sure everybody is on board but dont forget our little arrangement
very well
of all the rotten luck  we just had to land right as it was getting dark
the timing isnt ideal granted but with a torch in hand your men will be able to see a ways ahead
i  dont believe we have any flint or tinder handy what are our chances without torches
your men wont be totally blind but theyll barely be able to see in front of them still i imagine you can find a spare torch or two lying around somewhere
then lets get moving theres no time to waste
boss you really mean to make for tarrah im goin pale jus thinkin about fightin the empire  i mean we might as well jus jab a knife in our necks now an save everybody some time
i know i know im just leading her on gotta get my foot in the door with that lass an just who does shiva think he is talking to me like that did that cutthroat sellsword grow a conscience when nobody was looking
hey boss we got a couple do gooders scurryin in from the west
what here you gotta be joking  all right boys lets go say hello the sharks are gonna be well fed tonight
the pirates seem to have greater numbers  can we make it through this commander
numbers arent everything we keep our heads about us well make it through just fine
o of course commander still would you happen to know anything useful about this lifis thug
hah thug is too generous for lifis hes small time aint even worth killing when we get our hands on him take him alive and dont let him go after the fightings done well bring him back to iz and see that he gets justice for his crimes
not too bright are you 
how  careless all this way just to die  here 
what a naïve bunch  still i owe them a debt now
h hey wait a minute i aint that bad really maybe i been wrong here and there but not enough to deserve this
ugh  s safy i  need 
much obliged moron ah looks like i gotta build things up from scratch now 
the pirates seem to have escaped but never mind that is the cleric safe
ahem ive found her sire
thank you kind folk i owe you my  hm is that 
i beg your pardon milady battle is dirty business and if i have some grime or blood on my face 
have you forgotten me already lord leif its me safy we met in tarrah
safy you say i knew a young woman at the monastery in tarrah by that name
i only had the honor of seeing you two or three times milord i suppose i wasnt as memorable as i thought still you left an impression on me all the same when you departed the city it was i who wiped lady linoans face of tears
ah now i can place you your father was a priest and you were rather close with linoan were you not
as close as a woman of common birth can be i suppose the duke of tarrah was lady linoans father and i am more her servant than peer
that aside how did you come to be here has something happened to linoan
you mean to say you dont know whats happened to tarrah since you left ah  let me start from the beginning after the duke passed away the empire installed their own governor the man proved to be a walking pox inflicting tragedy after tragedy upon us just this year they even began child hunts in tarrah
child hunts 
that proved to be the breaking point the people of tarrah revolted installing lady linoan as rightful duchess they hired any sellsword who could stand upright and then sent offerings of gold and gemstones to the empires leading noblemen it was  an admirable effort but king bloom of thracia did not forgive such a slight and summoned the imperial army to besiege tarrah the sellswords proved craven and fled and now only a handful of militiamen stand between the empire and our city lady linoan bade me leave and seek out any who would fight in tarrahs defense
are things truly that dire  the duke sheltered me for half a decade before the empire learned of it and had him executed not a day goes by that i dont think of his generosity  youre seeking folk to aid tarrah look no more i pledge to deliver tarrah from this evil lets be off safy
you will be most welcome in tarrah lord leif thank you
well dont keep me in suspense what are you gonna do with me
thats up to the villagers of iz were taking you back there to answer for your crimes
we both know whatll happen you handin me over to them is as good as killin me yourself safy cmon we had a deal i said id go to tarrah with you
 lord leif lifis is not an evil man hes committed many foul acts as a pirate yes but he seemed genuinely repentant when we spoke earlier give him a chance to redeem himself in the eyes of the gods
 all right if safy believes in you i can give you a chance for the time being
hah ive cheated death once again just gotta wait for the right opening then ill book it but come to think of it  if that boys really the missing leonster heir the empired pay mighty well to hear of it  its worth mulling over at least either way itll have to wait until after safy has given in to my many charms
/***EOF***/
already a day behind dryas leifs forces were finally rested and ready he was just about to march for ulster when a most unexpected message was delivered to him it was this moment that marked leifs beginning down a long road of hardship 
everyone is ready august
hold a moment my prince it seems someone has come to the castle  one of dryas men i believe
prince leif i  im sorry 
sorry for what whats happened
th the imperial army counterattacked  we were  slaughtered 
wh what wheres dryas
duke dryas he  to ensure some of us could escape he  he rushed the enemys flank im sorry he  met his end 
dryas  hes    
we werent strong enough  forgive us
th thats absurd  this cant be 
prince leif time is of the essence we must withdraw all of our troops at once before our entire army is massacred
no  this cant be happening 
prince leif snap out of it if we lose our troops now duke dryas will have died for nothing we owe it to him to save as many of our people as we can
 now the maggots understand what the empire is capable of ill leave the rest to you wolff know that house friege expects nothing less than castle leonsters recapture
it shall be done
so many of our people have died  but as long as i still live so too does alster
i have a duty to protect my troops but  is this truly right ah father sleuf  what i would give to hear your counsel 
conomor stop your foolishness this instant
princess miranda what are you doing here
i was rescued by prince leif and at my urging he commanded his army to come to ulsters aid it cost him countless soldiers and one of his closest advisors and what have you done for me just what is all this what idiocy compelled you to make ulsters finest knights into imperial lapdogs
ah  you have my  deepest apologies 
the enemy isnt leonster you fool the enemy is the empire command the knights of ulster to aid in leonsters retreat do it this instant as ruler i hereby declare that all of ulster is part of prince leifs liberation army their mission is now our own
as you command milady knights of ulster from this moment onward we are part of the north thracian liberation army serve prince leif as you would serve me well take sanctuary in castle leonster and plot the recapture of our motherland from there so orders her highness princess miranda by royal decree
lady amalda lower your sword its me sleuf
father sleuf what in blazes are you doing here
i came to meet with you prince leif of the liberation army has been waiting for you
you  want me to betray my country thats not even in the realm of possibility father sleuf if it was i  i wouldnt be living in such torment
lady amalda a country isnt the plaything of a king or nobleman if a country has lost its way its a knights duty to lead it back will you stand idly by and allow evil to consume your home all out of the fear of being called a traitor
its not that simple i have to consider what will become of my troops if i defect
they can decide for themselves but your foremost duty is to your country follow your heart
mm  i understand father sleuf i shall fight with the liberation army i know what i must do rescue the children stolen by the empire
youre just a stain on my blade
ugh  this  isnt possible 
withdraw your damn troops dont die for nothing
fitting  a life lived steeped in blood can only end with more blood 
what am i to do with myself now 
forgive me  this is for ulster
ulster shall yet  rise again 
mm  ill bear the shame of this defeat for the rest of my days  every third thought shall be my grave 
and so the empires retaliation begins  theres nothing more we can do we should retreat to the castle
august this is all my fault  its like i killed dryas myself 
you dont have the luxury of wallowing in regret not now there will be time to atone to duke dryas after youve defended leonster summon all your patience and discipline youll need it for what lies ahead
 youre right
come now i do bring some good news ive heard multiple reports that a large rebellion is taking place in the eastern reaches of isaach they seem to be putting up a good fight against the empire by all accounts do you know who their leader is
if the rebellion is in isaach couldnt it be prince shannan finn told me about him  he has the most gifted sword arm in all the world and hes beloved by his people  in short hes a far greater man than i 
of course prince shannan is with the rebels but their leader is someone else
that being 
lord seliph of house chalphy the people of isaach and grannvale alike hail him as the scion of light
l lord seliph can this be true 
i believe it is and his father lord sigurd was your uncle the crusader sigurd  as recently as a decade ago he was reviled as a traitor but nowadays hes a popular folk hero he saw through the emperors schemes from the beginning and died trying to protect the world from his machinations bards spread his tale across the land and it captivated the hearts of every man woman and child suffering under the empires rule  and so hes become more legend than man now the child of that legend is fighting to realize his fathers dream  the people feel hope once again and blinded by that hope they wouldnt hesitate to die for his cause  this is a bounty from the gods we couldnt have crafted a more perfect opportunity ourselves
  what exactly are you saying
im saying theres a reason so many people are ready to die for lord seliph its not just because hes a strong warrior our era demands a hero the people clamor for one and so  someone has crafted lord seliph to be their hero forged him if you will in much the same way one forges metal into a blade taking a man and sculpting him into what the people need do you understand no one chooses to become a hero theyre willed into a hero by the people around them shaped by the needs of others
august  does that mean  the people in my life crafted me to be what they needed too
mm  youll have to come to your own conclusions on the matter though i will say this  recall that duke dryas lost an arm protecting you and now hes traded his life for yours have you ever stopped to wonder why he did that why do so many people keep sacrificing themselves for you why do so many hail you as a hero think on that and think well 
the prince has ordered that he not be disturbed for the time being you may state your business to me instead
oh well uh  we fled from alster ysee the imperials were hot on our trail when your army showed up to help us we just wanted to give the prince this master seal as a way of sayin thanks
leave it with me ill deliver it to the prince and convey your gratitude
all right thank you

leifs liberation army made its way to munster through the pass formerly guarded by fort danzig before them stood the vast river thracia the largest river in the thracian peninsula it was this rivers water that blessed much of north thracia with rich fertile land just beyond its rapid waves the city of munster awaited 
youve done plenty saias quickly you must begone from here
i shall do no such thing ill stay at your side until the end count
if you value me half as much as you claim be silent and listen
have you already forgotten how my only daughter my aida gave her life to protect you from that fiend manfroy surely your lonely childhood in that isolated monastery cannot have left your memory so easily 
yet hiding you in such a remote place was all i could do to shield you from him i could scarcely contain my laughter when you finally came of age and were appointed a military officer at manfroys own suggestion the fool didnt realize who you really were having lost your trail years prior yet his mistake was your gain and you set to honing your skills as a tactician with a passion knowing who saias was despite that not even i knew you possessed so obvious was your talent that it only took you a decade to rise from a lowly officer to the royal bishop of house velthomer and for a brief time you were so trusted by emperor arvis that manfroy couldnt dare harm you and i was able to rest easy but that sanctuary has come to an end with the power of prince julius behind them the loptr church now wields more influence than the emperor himself you bear the brand of fjalar saias neither prince julius nor princess julia inherited her mark that is why manfroy fears you so
for the sake of fjalar for the sake of house velthomer you must live on to preserve that holy bloodline the fact of the matter is this you cannot die here and so you must hide your true strength more than just my life is at stake here
its been some time since last we met bishop saias
commander reinhardt what are you doing here milord id heard princess ishtar had returned to miletos werent you with her
i worry for my little sister  ive stayed behind to see to her safety besides lady ishtar has no need of me any longer
 did the princess really tell you that
she did with a man as powerful as prince julius with her she says theres no reason for me to escort her as well
   commander this is difficult for me to ask but  ive heard that lady olwen has defected to the rebels is this true
 it is but shes little more than a child im certain shes being deceived by the enemy somehow  if i can just speak with her i know i can bring her back to her senses
mm  i know that youll always see her as your little sister but shes not quite so little anymore shes a grown adult commander she wasnt going to be the little girl chasing her big brothers coattails forever how she lives her life is her choice to make you must accept that
how olwen lives her life  bishop do you mean to say that her path has split apart from mine
indeed  though i do agree you should speak with her if the gods give you a chance to do so
the river thracia  its stunning just how vast it is its clean shimmering waters are surely the blessing of earth mother ethnia herself
indeed im afraid its beauty is lost on me i see only a river stained red with blood true the river has granted this land many blessings but it also stirs greed in the hearts of men countless battles have been fought for control of this river and now we find ourselves about to fight another take heed my prince the last king of leonster your very own grandfather king calf was slain here
thats right  my lord grandfather met his end at this very spot 
ah at the risk of sounding pedantic king calf didnt perish exactly here he died on the bridge just south of here he fell in battle when the knights of conote raydriks men suddenly turned against his army shattering their formation now bear in mind that the river is notoriously easy to defend but near impossible to attack the enemy has likely stationed powerful battalions here to halt our advance i expect this battle will be our most difficult yet prince leif steel yourself for what lies ahead 
brother  as soon as i saw the gelben ritter were here i knew you couldnt be far my lord brother 
it feels like a lifetime since we last saw each other  thank the gods we were able to meet again
brother  i 
come now there will be time to tell me about all thats happened once youre safe everyone will be so glad to see you again every friege worth a damn has been worried sick about you heh im sure you have plenty of good stories to regale them with olwen  lets go back home together
home  no i cannot go back to castle friege i cant show my face there until i right the wrongs i helped commit and rescue the children taken by the loptians dont try to argue ive already made up my mind
olwen listen to what youre saying were family youre my darling little sister i couldnt bear to lose you
im more than just your little sister im my own woman this is the decision i came to after thinking it over on my own i know what it means for me ive prepared myself for the anguish it will bring not even the words of my own brother could sway my mind now
then  then that makes us enemies do you have it in you to raise your blade against me olwen
if you stand in our way brother then  i have no choice
i see  so you really are serious about this  its exactly as bishop saias said you have indeed grown up thats clear to me now youve become a formidable woman olwen im proud of you this is the last time ill be able to treat you as my little sister and not as my enemy but as your older brother i have one last gift for you
this is  i recognize this sword its your most prized weapon brother
a token of better days  princess ishtar gave me that sacred blade but ive no need for it now you can put it to better use
but why i know how important it is to you
thats  thats none of your concern now ride back to your army olwen the next time we meet on the battlefield ill show you no mercy sister of mine or no am i clear
gods above the enemy has advanced this far saias you must flee now
no count come what may ill stay by your side
still your tongue just do as i say the battle is lost
wait please i must 
 thats it now collapse the bridge tell the gelben ritter to charge
the enemy has finally gotten close enough in the name of the gelben ritter dont let them take one more step toward the castle
you shall go no further
the empire  is undefeatable  guhh
theres nothing more for me to say
this must be fate  forgive me 
i am  undone 
may we meet again
lay down your weapons youll only get hurt
weve made it across the river at last
a river stained red with blood now i understand what you meant by that somehow i can feel that taint upon the river 
 blood that has been spilled can never be returned wise men accept this and see to it that blood is only spilled for a worthy cause bah enough of my ruminations come along prince leif we must hurry to munster
