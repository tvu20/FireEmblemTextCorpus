I think it would be an ideal place for two people to spend time together. Yes, that sounds perfect... I'll buy you a dress of fine silk, Ishtar. And what else would go nicely with it...? Ah, I know just the thing! A ruby tiara! Hilda is already arranging a most splendid banquet for us, I'm sure. Ishtar, you can dress up and take everyone by surprise with your captivating beauty.

I understand... Forgive me, but I must ask this of you: let Reinhardt go home. Please."}, {"speaker": "Julius", "line": "Heh, heh... Very well, we'll leave him be. Let's be off! Oh, Ishtar... how I love you!"}]}
