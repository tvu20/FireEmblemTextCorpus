Tryin' to till a field is like sawing through rock! All I wanted was a full belly, but you let that wench Eyvel cheat you outta the good land! She's got you wrapped around her little finger!

You ain't never known real hardship\u2014just my petty chores! You know why? Cuz I knew I could never trust you with more! Fact is, I could barely trust you with my laundry, junior!

Why couldn't they just earn their food through honest labor?"}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "And where would they labor? Their very land was infertile. Many of these men were children of Thracian farmers. Abandoned by their parents, they turned to banditry out of sheer necessity.

I never had to worry about hunger."}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "Then you were fortunate to have had such loyal allies and retainers, but it has left you lacking the perspective to truly understand how the common folk suffer. South Thracia is a land dominated by mountains\u2014steep, imposing crags dot the landscape, and a cliff lies around every corner. By nature, the land demands severity and discipline from all who live in it. Farmers work themselves to the bone to cultivate what few crops the land will provide, but even so, it is not enough to survive on. And thus they are left with a terrible dilemma: for every one person who gets fed, two others must go hungry. Dagdar's men, abandoned in their youth, are the result of this ruthless arithmetic. This is the reality of living in South Thracia."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "Th-Then they should just import food from elsewhere! In North Thracia, cities had an abundance of crops\u2014buy their excess!"}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "Ah, but the whole of North Thracia\u2014the old coalition of Munster\u2014resolved long ago to prohibit trade with South Thracia. Food, especially, was closely guarded."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "...Wh-Why would the North do such a thing?!"}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "Historically? Recall the war between Nj\u00f6run and D\u00e1inn's children, 100 years ago, that led to the province of Munster declaring independence from the rest of Thracia. The two have considered each other enemies ever since, and this hostility persists because they are mutually unwilling to communicate. The noble houses of Munster, in particular, remained stubborn and selfish for a century afterward."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "I... had been told that Thracia was all but a military state, that it was an infamously belligerent kingdom. But if they are merely the product of such wretched conditions... How did things all go so wrong? The North and South were a single kingdom once..."}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "It all returns to the Tragedy of the G\u00e1e Bolg, to the misfortune that seems to befall all those who wield either of the holy lances. North Thracia has been plagued by selfish and short-sighted rulers. You must learn from their example\u2014learn how not to govern. If nothing else, you must learn enough to not repeat your father's mistake..."}]}
