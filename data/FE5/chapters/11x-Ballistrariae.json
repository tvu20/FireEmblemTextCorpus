They seem to be led by Leif, the rebel prince who caused a stir when he escaped from the dungeons of Castle Munster. This has escalated beyond a mere border skirmish. I must ride for Belhalla at once and alert the Imperial Army's high command. Not to imply that this relieves you of your duties, of course. I still have orders for you and your men. Your platoon is to barricade itself inside this wing of the fortress, and stall the rebels for as long as possible. Buy me time."}, {"speaker": "Oltof", "line": "B-But General, the enemy has already breached the fort's interior! My men and I cannot possibly withstand a prolonged siege!"}, {"speaker": "Kempf", "line": "Nonsense! You still have one final means of defense: the balistrariae."}, {"speaker": "Oltof", "line": "...You want us to huddle behind those gaps in the walls and take potshots at the invaders?! Y-You're asking us to die...!"}, {"speaker": "Kempf", "line": "No, I'm ordering you to kill the invaders before they kill you. There's a tremendous difference. Mind you, no part of my orders require you to die. In fact, if you die, you have only yourself to blame. Oh, and I'm not \"asking\" anything. You used that word, not I. These are orders."}, {"speaker": "Oltof", "line": "I... understand. If... If this is an order, I have no choice in the matter."}, {"speaker": "Kempf", "line": "That's the first smart thing you've said, Bishop. Take your own advice and follow my orders\u2014otherwise, you'll be keeping Olwen company in the dungeon. Ah, speaking of which, you mustn't forget to dispose of the prisoners. They'll only cause trouble if they manage to survive all this."}, {"speaker": "Oltof", "line": "...As you wish, General."}, {"speaker": "Kempf", "line": "Don't look so glum, Bishop.

I was arrested! Wh-What are you kids doing here?!"}, {"speaker": "Girl", "line": "S-Soldiers were raidin' our village... They took me an' brought me here, even when I kicked an' screamed...! Wh-What's gonna happen to us...?"}, {"speaker": "Boy", "line": "Yer talkin' like they ain't already decided what to do with us! They're gonna sacrifice us to Loptous! They're gonna send us to Belhalla an' kill every last one of us... I know cuz my sister got taken there an' she never came back!"}, {"speaker": "Girl", "line": "No! P-Please don't take us away! I jus' wanna go back home... I jus' wanna see Mama and Papa again...!"}, {"speaker": "Olwen", "line": "It can't be... Has the Empire really been conducting child hunts? I'd heard rumors, but... I was sure it was just rebel propaganda. I never even considered that it could be true... For the Empire to be doing something so heinous... This is inexcusable! I believed in the Empire, I trusted in House Friege... and this is what they've been doing all along?!"}, {"speaker": "Girl", "line": "Please, ma'am, help us! Take us back home!"}, {"speaker": "Olwen", "line": "...Everything's going to be all right. You don't have to worry anymore, little one. They won't lay a finger on you ever again.

Don't get careless!"}, {"speaker": "Oltof", "line": "Hmph! Orders be damned, I'll not just sit here and wait to die! Men! Can all of you truly go along with this, knowing what I was told by the General? I must be off.

It's easy to see why the people of Tarrah rebelled."}, {"speaker": "Dryas", "line": "Indeed. But that makes the Empire all the more desperate to make an example of Tarrah and stamp out their uprising. Supposing they allowed Tarrah to defy them, countless cities would follow suit. It's for this very reason that the Empire has summoned troops from across Jugdral just to attack one city: they move to crush both Tarrah and its hopes all at once. I've even heard tell that the Gelben Ritter have been recalled from Belhalla to join in the assault."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "The Gelben Ritter... That's House Friege's elite battalion of knights, correct?"}, {"speaker": "Dryas", "line": "Indeed, but they are no mere knights: They're Mage Knights, each of them handpicked for the job, and each of them a noble from House Friege's inner circle. They're one of the strongest\u2014if not THE strongest\u2014battalions of knights in the continent. To make matters worse, they're led by none other than Princess Ishtar\u2014the woman widely feared as the Goddess of Thunder. And her adjutant, Sir Reinhardt, is a damned fine warrior in his own right. Some even believe him to be the reincarnation of the crusader Thrud."}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "A man who readily lends his hand to child hunting is what you call a \"damned fine warrior\"?

Please, do tell!"}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "Need I spell it out? Reinhardt is Ishtar's adjutant and guardian. Ishtar is the betrothed of Crown Prince Julius. Julius\u2014the very same man the people call the \"Scion of Darkness,\" need I remind you\u2014is the vessel of the dark god Loptous!
