However, traveling along such an exposed, public road had its price: the army would have to breach Fort Nordrhein, an Imperial base. There, House Friege had deployed an elite battalion of soldiers, determined to stop the Liberation Army in its path..."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Nicolov", "line": "Kempf, for your sake, I hope you're prepared for anything."}, {"speaker": "Kempf", "line": "Leave everything to me, Colonel Nicolov. These rabble may have the gall to call themselves a \"Liberation Army,\" but they're no stronger than a pack of bandits. My battalion shall shatter their delusions of grandeur with ease."}, {"speaker": "Nicolov", "line": "\"With ease,\" you say? Get your head on straight, boy! Are you not the very man who abandoned his post and left his men to die at Fort Dandrum? You scurried home with your tail between your legs, brought shame to your uniform, and you still have the audacity to be arrogant?! These men are the Lanzenritter of Leonster, Prince Leif leads their vanguard, and they're within spitting distance of their motherland! Their morale is higher than the damn clouds! Underestimate them and you're as good as dead!"}, {"speaker": "Kempf", "line": "Ah... You... have my apologies, Colonel..."}, {"speaker": "Nicaraf", "line": "Save it, Kempf. Just do as I say. I need you and your battalion to stay on the bridge. Guard it with your life. The ballistae in the rear will help hold your position. No matter what, don't move out of their range. You got that? It's an order: stick with the ballistae!"}, {"speaker": "Kempf", "line": "...Yes, sir."}, {"speaker": "Nicolov", "line": "Now, it may seem like we're on the defensive, but we're just biding our time. The real battle will begin when our reinforcements arrive. When the Knights of Ulster get here, we'll have the rebels surrounded from the front and back. We'll trap them in a pincer attack and crush the enemy in one fell swoop!"}, {"speaker": "Kempf", "line": "What? The Knights of Ulster are to be our reinforcements?"}, {"speaker": "Nicolov", "line": "The very same. Count Conomor is bringing nearly 100 men\u2014the rebels will be ambushed by the mightiest army in North Thracia!"}, {"speaker": "Kempf", "line": "I... see... So Conomor is to get all the glory, then? No, this won't do at all! The rebels must die by MY hands, and mine alone!"}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "My prince, the scout we sent ahead has returned. He brings word of the enemy's formation."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "Hm... The perimeter of Fort Nordrhein is protected by ballistae... We won't be able to seize it without doing something about them."}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "Unfortunately, that bridge is the only way across the river\u2014and it's being defended by a battalion of heavily-armored knights. To make matters worse, attacking the bridge would put us within range of the enemy's ballistae."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "Then our only option is to lure the knights out of the ballistae's range."}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "I doubt any subterfuge would convince them to move far enough away. They have a far superior position, and they know it."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "Perhaps, but it's still worth considering. Surely there's some way of tricking them away from the bridge..."}, {"speaker": "Olwen", "line": "Leave that task to me, Lord Leif. I have... a history with their commander. I'm certain I can lure him away from the bridge\u2014and his troops will be forced to follow."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "J-Just what are you proposing, Olwen?! I won't allow you to put yourself in such grave danger!"}, {"speaker": "Olwen", "line": "Then I ask it from you as a favor, Prince. I want to help you just as you helped me!"}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Kempf", "line": "Order a full charge on the enemy's front lines! I'll give a pouch of gold for every rebel head!

That goes against Colonel Nicolov's orders!"}, {"speaker": "Kempf", "line": "And when we win the day, no one will care! Besides, Nicolov is nothing! Nobody! And I'M royalty\u2014don't you forget that! All troops, charge! Kill every last one of them!"}, {"speaker": "Conomor", "line": "So the Lanzenritter is alive and well... and just as fierce as their forefathers. Perhaps... Perhaps we should withdraw, just on this occasion. We've misjudged the rebels' strength. Knights of Ulster, I'm ordering a full retreat!"}], "recruit-talk": [{"speaker": "Karin", "line": "Hey, hey!

Well, that should be an easy ask! Say, if a noble title is all you're askin' for, wouldn't that make you just a commoner? You must be a real hard worker to have made it into House Friege's army!

So another piece of the puzzle falls into place! No wonder you're chasing after nobility so stubbornly when it's literally stamped into your name.

Besides, you don't really look like an \"Ilios.\" Like, if I shouted \"Ilios!\" into a crowded room, nobody would look at you. No offense. You look more like a... Troy! Oh, that's perfect!
