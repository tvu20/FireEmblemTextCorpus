Together with Nanna, a young noblewoman under Finn's care, the trio fled pursuers sent by the conquerors of North Thracia: the Grannvale Empire, which lay to the west.", "Yet Finn proved stronger than those who hunted them, and the three made their way to the cities of Ulster and Tarrah, posing as common vagrants. Eventually, they drifted into Fiana, a small village on Thracia's eastern coast. Fiana was an independent community with its own militia, the Freeblades of Fiana, led by the swordswoman Eyvel. Eyvel welcomed Leif's group as if they were her own kin. Under her watchful eye, the deposed prince spent his childhood in Fiana, growing into maturity alongside youths of common birth. Now, in year 776 of the Grannvale calendar..."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Raydrik", "line": "Have you found that whelp of a prince yet?"}, {"speaker": "Weissman", "line": "Regretfully not, milord. The men have searched the village top to bottom, but came up with nothing."}, {"speaker": "Raydrik", "line": "Why is such a simple task taking you so long? There's little doubt that the heir to House Leonster is hiding here. You've been too gentle with these villagers\u2014give them ample motivation to talk."}, {"speaker": "Weissman", "line": "We are of the same mind, milord\u2014I've already ordered the men to do as much. Yet the townsfolk claim the prince isn't here. According to them, he left with the Freeblades to fend off a pirate raid on a nearby village."}, {"speaker": "Raydrik", "line": "Freeblades? What nonsense is that?"}, {"speaker": "Weissman", "line": "They're the local militia, sire. As I understand it, this village was once home to a group of brigands\u2014rather savage ones, at that. About a decade ago, they were routed by Eyvel, a wandering sellsword. She claimed the village as her own and founded the Freeblades to protect the region from future attacks. She's supposedly quite a wonder with a sword..."}, {"speaker": "Raydrik", "line": "Hmm... She may be a problem."}, {"speaker": "Weissman", "line": "You have nothing to fear, milord: we've taken Eyvel's daughter captive. What's more, we also captured the daughter of Finn, the very knight guarding the prince's life. With the leverage we have over them, they'll have no choice but to surrender."}, {"speaker": "Raydrik", "line": "Hmph. I admit, you have your uses, Weissman. The women will accompany me back to Munster. You'll remain here and prepare for when these upstart rebels return. See that the young Leonster pup is put in chains befitting a stray mutt."}, {"speaker": "Weissman", "line": "Your trust in me is well placed, sire. Men, bring the girls here!"}, {"speaker": "Raydrik", "line": "What's your name, lass?"}, {"speaker": "Mareeta", "line": "Hmph\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Raydrik", "line": "Hah! A fighting spirit to match a pretty face. Now, let's have a look at the other one... Ah, you must be Finn's young ward. I hear your mother was royalty of House Nordion, is that right? You certainly don't lack for grace, despite living in this backwater hovel\u2014holy blood doesn't run thin even in squalor, I see."}, {"speaker": "Nanna", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Raydrik", "line": "What a pleasant surprise the two of you make for.

Something's rotten here..."}, {"speaker": "Halvan", "line": "I'll scout ahead, Commander. Hold here a moment."}, {"speaker": "Halvan", "line": "Commander, Fiana is packed to the brim with Imperial troops! They... must have struck while we were away."}, {"speaker": "Osian", "line": "What? No way is the Empire gonna make a mess of our home! Commander, let's move in!"}, {"speaker": "Halvan", "line": "Calm down, Osian. We'll get slaughtered if we just charge in blindly."}, {"speaker": "Osian", "line": "Yeah, Halvan, I'm sure the village will appreciate your patient attitude while everyone's being rounded up and jailed!"}, {"speaker": "Eyvel", "line": "Peace, Osian. Halvan is right. Seems we've finally been noticed by the Empire. Looks like this is goodbye, Little Leif. I'm sorry. Finn, take him as far away from here as you can. Leave the soldiers to us."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "No, Commander! Nanna is still in the village! I won't leave without her!"}, {"speaker": "Eyvel", "line": "I'll get her back. Don't worry."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "It's more than that, Commander... I won't run anymore. That's my decision to make."}, {"speaker": "Eyvel", "line": "...Finn, you wanna weigh in here? You going to let the Little Lord throw himself into harm's way like this?"}, {"speaker": "Finn", "line": "Lord Leif has seen the passing of 15 summers, by now.

Hmph, I suppose I let Little Leif come with us to fight off those pirates, myself... Guess I made up my own mind when I did that.

If we're done arguing, there's an invasion happening over that ridge!"}, {"speaker": "Eyvel", "line": "All right, get ready to move in. But stay sharp: most foot-soldiers are just regular folk, forced into the Imperial Army against their will. If they surrender, just take their weapons and let them go.

I mean, if we can't put up a good fight ourselves, we'll be the ones surrendering."}, {"speaker": "Eyvel", "line": "Knock 'em around if you have to, sure, but don't overdo it. That means you, Osian."}, {"speaker": "Osian", "line": "Hey, c'mon, gimme some credit, Commander!"}, {"speaker": "Eyvel", "line": "OK, enough chatter!
