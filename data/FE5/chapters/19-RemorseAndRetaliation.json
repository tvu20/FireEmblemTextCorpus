Can this be true...?"}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "I believe it is\u2014and his father, Lord Sigurd, was your uncle. The Crusader Sigurd... As recently as a decade ago, he was reviled as a traitor, but nowadays he's a popular folk hero. He saw through the Emperor's schemes from the beginning, and died trying to protect the world from his machinations. Bards spread his tale across the land, and it captivated the hearts of every man, woman, and child suffering under the Empire's rule... And so he's become more legend than man. Now, the child of that legend is fighting to realize his father's dream... The people feel hope once again. And blinded by that hope, they wouldn't hesitate to die for his cause... This is a bounty from the gods. We couldn't have crafted a more perfect opportunity ourselves."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "......What exactly are you saying?"}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "I'm saying there's a reason so many people are ready to die for Lord Seliph. It's not just because he's a strong warrior. Our era demands a hero. The people clamor for one, and so... someone has crafted Lord Seliph to be their hero. Forged him, if you will, in much the same way one forges metal into a blade\u2014taking a man and sculpting him into what the people need. Do you understand? No one chooses to become a hero. They're willed into a hero by the people around them, shaped by the needs of others."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "August... Does that mean... the people in my life crafted me to be what they needed, too?"}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "Mm... You'll have to come to your own conclusions on the matter. Though I will say this... Recall that Duke Dryas lost an arm protecting you\u2014and now he's traded his life for yours. Have you ever stopped to wonder why he did that? Why do so many people keep sacrificing themselves for you? Why do so many hail you as a hero? Think on that, and think well..."}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "The prince has ordered that he not be disturbed, for the time being. You may state your business to me instead."}, {"speaker": "Man", "line": "Oh, well, uh... We fled from Alster, y'see. The Imperials were hot on our trail when your army showed up to help us! We just wanted to give the prince this Master Seal, as a way of sayin' thanks."}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "Leave it with me. I'll deliver it to the prince, and convey your gratitude."}, {"speaker": "Man", "line": "All right. Thank you."}]}
