Their next goal was a matter of some debate: the Freeblades of Fiana and the Magi wished to make for Castle Munster and liberate it first, while the nobles of Leonster and the sellswords of Tarrah favored liberating Castle Leonster first. Ultimately, pragmatism prevailed, as it was agreed that seizing Leonster first was more advantageous to the army's mobility. However, as they neared Solwood Pass, Leif would soon have to make another strategic decision..."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Dryas", "line": "Prince Leif, a moment, if I may? I would advise heading west at Solwood Pass to reach the road to Nordrhein."}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "And it is on this matter that Duke Dryas and I are of different minds. I instead argue heading east at the pass. That route will allow us to attack Leonster from the south, where the Empire's defenses are sure to be weaker."}, {"speaker": "Dryas", "line": "Clearly you aren't well-acquainted with the area. If you were, you'd know that Millefeuille Forest lies to Leonster's south. The place is synonymous with folk getting lost and never returning! Hell, the locals even call it \"Mirage Forest\" for short!"}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "Don't patronize me. I'm well aware of the dangers\u2014but so is the Empire. They won't be expecting an attack to come from such a treacherous area. With our smaller numbers, making clever use of the terrain is our only hope of victory. That's just basic tactics!"}, {"speaker": "Dryas", "line": "I must strenuously object! All of Thracia\u2014no, all of Jugdral is watching our battle! This is about more than victory! We cannot merely win, we must win in such a way that gives inspiration and hope to the masses oppressed by the Empire! Are we to skulk through the woods like common bandits? Nay! We have to make a glorious spectacle of it, charging into battle with Leonster's flag held high!"}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "Such a spectacle would indeed be glorious\u2014for the Empire. We'd be charging right into their front lines. Our casualties would be enormous."}, {"speaker": "Dryas", "line": "Some of our own would perish, true, but it would be an honorable death worthy of a knight of Leonster."}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "Don't presume to speak for all of us, Duke Dryas. Only a small fraction of our troops are knights\u2014many more hold no title. To them, your notion of an \"honorable death\" is something neither meaningful nor desirable. See that you don't get innocent men killed by projecting your own values onto them."}, {"speaker": "Dryas", "line": "Th-That's uncalled for, August! Your very words come perilously close to an insult! *Sigh* Though I suppose there's little point to us arguing further. The decision rests with Prince Leif now."}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "...Indeed it does. We shall do as the prince commands."}, {"speaker": "Bandit", "line": "Boss, Boss! I gots a great idea! Let's hit up that there village today!"}, {"speaker": "Zile", "line": "What, that old slum? It's just a couple lean-tos and an outhouse. They don't got nuthin' worth stealin'. Heh, burnin' the place down might actually be an improvement fer them villagers."}, {"speaker": "Bandit", "line": "They might not got anything valuable, but they DO got girls. Real pretty girls. We could just snatch 'em up and sell 'em to slavers! It'd be an easy payday!"}, {"speaker": "Zile", "line": "Huh... You might be onto something, young'un! All right, let's do it! Move out, boys!
