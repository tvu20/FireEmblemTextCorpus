That's how you can tell we're just at the base of Mount Violdrake."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "Your help has been invaluable, Carrion. You should make your way back to General Hannibal\u2014we can take it from here."}, {"speaker": "Carrion", "line": "I'm... not returning to Thracia, milord. I told General Hannibal of my intentions, and he gave me his blessing."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "What?"}, {"speaker": "Carrion", "line": "Do you think the General a fool? He knew full well who you really were\u2014as does half the Thracian Peninsula. Rumors of a surviving Leonster heir have been circulating for years. Anyone with sense knew it was only a matter of time until this survivor took up arms and rallied an army to battle the Empire. I always expected\u2014nay, prayed\u2014that this day would come, and now I have the honor of taking part in the liberation myself! The motherland shall soon breathe free again!"}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "Motherland? You... mean to say you're not Thracian?"}, {"speaker": "Carrion", "line": "Indeed. I was born to a sworn knight of House Leonster. My father perished in the war, but my mother and I were taken in by General Hannibal. Ah... but I'm being presumptuous, aren't I? If it pleases you, Prince Leif, I want nothing more than to fight for House Leonster again, and reclaim our sovereign land."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "I'm... not sure that I'm the liege you seek, frankly. I don't know that I have power enough to reclaim Leonster\u2014for the time being, I merely want to aid Tarrah."}, {"speaker": "Carrion", "line": "Even so, as long as I fight beneath the banner of House Leonster, I care not what the cause is. If you wish us elsewhere, milord, so be it. Assuming you accept my oath, I suggest we make for General Hannibal's villa."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "Hm? General Hannibal didn't seem the type to own a lavish mountain villa..."}, {"speaker": "Carrion", "line": "He's not. The villa is a safehouse for those like me: the many refugees of the fallen families of Leonster. There, under the protection of General Hannibal, Duke Dryas trains us in the ways of knighthood."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "D-Did I hear you correctly? Dryas...?! I can scarcely believe it... Duke Dryas is alive...?"}, {"speaker": "Carrion", "line": "See for yourself, milord. Shall we be off?"}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "Of course, at once! Being able to see Duke Dryas again... It's like a waking dream!"}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "Begging your pardon, my prince, but I've a matter of some urgency. The bandits of this area\u2014Dagdar's gang, to be precise\u2014are out in force, and seem to be pillaging a nearby village. What are your orders, sire?"}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "Say no more. I apologize, Carrion, but it seems Duke Dryas will have to wait. Will you aid me in defending the villagers?"}, {"speaker": "Carrion", "line": "Hah! You needn't ask\u2014I'd be worried if you didn't want to help them, milord! Still, this is most curious... This is Dagdar's territory, and the villages are under his protection. Why are they attacking...?"}, {"speaker": "Rumei", "line": "All right, pay up. Your crew might be happy spendin' all day stickin' up farmers, but I got an actual army to get back to."}, {"speaker": "Gomes", "line": "Change of plans. Gonna need you to put in a little extra elbow grease\u2014looks like there's a whole group of folk comin' this way. Dunno why they're here, but I need you to keep 'em clear of the manor while I'm inside. Once that's done, you'll get every coin."}, {"speaker": "Rumei", "line": "Damn, this was just supposed to be a one-time thing... All right, fine\u2014but it'll cost you extra if you want me to stick around."}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Rumei", "line": "Ugh, I didn't know Gomes an' his boys were gonna take forever and a day!

Through it, evil men can be led to do good, and good men can be led to do evil. We've seen as much with Dagdar's men, here. This is true of any group, be it a grand army or a small gang of bandits. The example set by their leader is what the people will follow. ...Do you understand, Prince Leif?"}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "...Yes.

It's good to see you again."}, {"speaker": "Tanya", "line": "Yeah, I guess... There's not much to it, really. Gomes just let me go after he found out that Papa was already dead. He... He said he was sorry about the village. There was no point to this whole damn attack with Papa long since buried..."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "I see... Listen, Tanya, I'm... truly sorry for what happened to your father..."}, {"speaker": "Tanya", "line": "No, it's OK... Papa did what he thought was right.

If you don't have any other plans, perhaps... perhaps you could come with us."}, {"speaker": "Tanya", "line": "Is... Is that really all right with you, having me tag along?"}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "Of course! You're always welcome with us!"}, {"speaker": "Tanya", "line": "Yeah...
