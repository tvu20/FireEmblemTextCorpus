Before them stood the vast River Thracia, the largest river in the Thracian Peninsula. It was this river's water that blessed much of North Thracia with rich, fertile land. Just beyond its rapid waves, the city of Munster awaited..."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Cowen", "line": "You've done plenty, Saias! Quickly, you must begone from here!"}, {"speaker": "Saias", "line": "I shall do no such thing! I'll stay at your side until the end, Count!"}, {"speaker": "Cowen", "line": "If you value me half as much as you claim, be silent and listen!"}, {"speaker": "Cowen", "line": "Have you already forgotten how my only daughter, my Aida, gave her life to protect you from that fiend Manfroy? Surely your lonely childhood in that isolated monastery cannot have left your memory so easily..."}, {"speaker": "Cowen", "line": "Yet hiding you in such a remote place was all I could do to shield you from him. I could scarcely contain my laughter when you finally came of age and were appointed a military officer at Manfroy's own suggestion\u2014the fool didn't realize who you really were, having lost your trail years prior. Yet his mistake was your gain, and you set to honing your skills as a tactician with a passion knowing who Saias was, despite that not even I knew you possessed. So obvious was your talent that it only took you a decade to rise from a lowly officer to the Royal Bishop of House Velthomer. And for a brief time, you were so trusted by Emperor Arvis that Manfroy couldn't dare harm you, and I was able to rest easy. But that sanctuary has come to an end: with the power of Prince Julius behind them, the Loptr Church now wields more influence than the Emperor himself. You bear the brand of Fjalar, Saias\u2014neither Prince Julius nor Princess Julia inherited her mark. That is why Manfroy fears you so."}, {"speaker": "Cowen", "line": "For the sake of Fjalar, for the sake of House Velthomer, you must live on to preserve that holy bloodline. The fact of the matter is this: you cannot die here, and so you must hide your true strength. More than just my life is at stake here!"}, {"speaker": "Reinhardt", "line": "It's been some time since last we met, Bishop Saias."}, {"speaker": "Saias", "line": "Commander Reinhardt! What are you doing here, milord? I'd heard Princess Ishtar had returned to Miletos\u2014weren't you with her?"}, {"speaker": "Reinhardt", "line": "I worry for my little sister... I've stayed behind to see to her safety. Besides, Lady Ishtar has no need of me any longer."}, {"speaker": "Saias", "line": "...Did the princess really tell you that?"}, {"speaker": "Reinhardt", "line": "She did. With a man as powerful as Prince Julius with her, she says, there's no reason for me to escort her as well."}, {"speaker": "Saias", "line": "\u2026\u2026 Commander, this is difficult for me to ask, but... I've heard that Lady Olwen has defected to the rebels. Is this true?"}, {"speaker": "Reinhardt", "line": "...It is. But she's little more than a child. I'm certain she's being deceived by the enemy, somehow... If I can just speak with her, I know I can bring her back to her senses."}, {"speaker": "Saias", "line": "Mm... I know that you'll always see her as your little sister, but she's not quite so little anymore. She's a grown adult, Commander. She wasn't going to be the little girl chasing her big brother's coattails forever. How she lives her life is her choice to make. You must accept that."}, {"speaker": "Reinhardt", "line": "How Olwen lives her life... Bishop, do you mean to say that her path has split apart from mine?"}, {"speaker": "Saias", "line": "Indeed... Though I do agree you should speak with her, if the gods give you a chance to do so."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "The River Thracia... It's stunning just how vast it is. Its clean, shimmering waters are surely the blessing of Earth Mother Ethnia herself."}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "Indeed? I'm afraid its beauty is lost on me\u2014I see only a river stained red with blood. True, the river has granted this land many blessings, but it also stirs greed in the hearts of men. Countless battles have been fought for control of this river\u2014and now we find ourselves about to fight another. Take heed, my prince. The last king of Leonster\u2014your very own grandfather, King Calf\u2014was slain here."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "That's right... My lord grandfather met his end at this very spot..."}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "Ah, at the risk of sounding pedantic, King Calf didn't perish exactly here\u2014he died on the bridge just south of here. He fell in battle when the Knights of Conote\u2014Raydrik's men\u2014suddenly turned against his army, shattering their formation. Now, bear in mind that the river is notoriously easy to defend, but near impossible to attack. The enemy has likely stationed powerful battalions here to halt our advance. I expect this battle will be our most difficult yet, Prince Leif. Steel yourself for what lies ahead..."}], "battle-talk": [{"speaker": "Olwen", "line": "Brother...!
