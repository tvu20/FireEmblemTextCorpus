Why?"}, {"speaker": "Miranda", "line": "All of this began when Leonster fell. My lord father was a gentle man, who hadn't the heart for battle\u2014and he knew there was little sense in fighting the Empire. But nevertheless, he took you in, sheltered you from the Empire\u2014and in so doing, invited their wrath! He had to turn me over to them as a hostage and forfeit his own right to the throne! And in the end, he departed this world in a state of utter misery... I cannot forgive you, Prince! If you'd never come to Alster, things wouldn't be like this..."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "\u2026\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Dorias", "line": "...Princess Miranda, I must beg to differ. The Empire planned to conquer Alster all along. Prince Leif's presence was merely a convenient excuse to do so. Not to speak ill of the dead, Princess, but your father was too timid. He had knights of the highest caliber at his command, yet when Thracia invaded, he sat on the fence instead of joining the fight. And despite being a sworn ally of Leonster, when our kingdom was in crisis, he sent no troops to our aid. He simply reaped what he sowed. Your father himself is to blame for your kingdom falling into ruin! Shifting the blame to Prince Leif is pure selfishness!"}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "Enough, Dorias! Nothing good will come of talk like that!"}, {"speaker": "Dorias", "line": "Hrm... I went too far, I admit. Please accept my apologies..."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "You have my apologies as well, Princess Miranda. I must beg your forgiveness... Had I known you were being held captive here, I would've come to your aid as fast as my legs could carry me. I can't imagine how difficult it was for you, being imprisoned here for so long..."}, {"speaker": "Miranda", "line": "...Well, admittedly, I haven't been imprisoned in this dreary monastery the whole time. Until last year, I was being kept in Alster. Count Conomor watched over me from afar, and I was comfortable enough. But then came the insurrections in Tahra and Leonster... That stoked the fires of revolution, and even in Alster, a contingent of the people plotted rebellion. Evidently, the Empire feared their position was becoming too vulnerable, and so I was moved to this dreadful place."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "Ah... Well, even one year is far too long to spend in a place like this."}, {"speaker": "Miranda", "line": "Prince Leif, if you weren't lying about wanting my forgiveness, you must lend me your strength! I must reclaim Alster... I must undo my father's regrets, and give meaning to his meaningless death!"}]}
