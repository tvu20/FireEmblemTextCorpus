Under the leadership of Duchess Linoan, daughter of the late Duke of Tarrah, the city had rebelled against the Empire, refusing to be complicit in their many crimes. This rebellion had not gone unpunished: the city had already been under siege by the Imperial Army, led by Colonel Paulus, for some time. Already in dire straits before the Empire's attack had even begun, it would now be exceptionally difficult for Tarrah to recover. Initially, Tarrah had brokered its freedom by agreeing to not interfere with the Grannvale Empire's conquest of North Thracia. In exchange, Tarrah had been allowed to keep its autonomy, but even at the time, the city's freedom was thought to be as precarious and fleeting as a candle flickering in the wind..."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Paulus", "line": "How's our situation here, General Rist?"}, {"speaker": "Rist", "line": "We have the city surrounded, Colonel Paulus. I formally request that we begin our assault now."}, {"speaker": "Paulus", "line": "Why the hurry? Baldack and the 8th Battalion should be here shortly.

I'll be damned if I just sit on my hands and let Baldack rob me of all the glory! All Imperial forces, begin the assault! Try to retreat, and I'll kill you myself! Go, go, go!"}, {"speaker": "Dean", "line": "The Empire's finally making their move... What's the plan, Glade?"}, {"speaker": "Glade", "line": "...The reality is that we can't match the strength of their army. All we can do is postpone the inevitable."}, {"speaker": "Eda", "line": "I could... I could take to the sky and scatter their front line. I reckon that would buy you some time, but\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Dean", "line": "Don't. You wouldn't make it far\u2014you'd be easy pickings for their ballistae. A Dracoknight's entire way of fighting is to swoop down, strike, and fly away\u2014all in one swift move. That's how you stay alive, Eda. Impatience will just get you killed."}, {"speaker": "Eda", "line": "All due respect, Brother, but this isn't the place for a lecture. Time isn't on our side..."}, {"speaker": "Glade", "line": "Hmm... For the time being, I'll dispatch my cadre of knights to the field."}, {"speaker": "Dean", "line": "But will your small band of knights be enough to stem the tide, Glade? Our sellswords have long since fled. Your men will have to go it alone."}, {"speaker": "Glade", "line": "...We must call upon Prince Shannan. The blood of the crusader Od\u2014the Sword Saint himself\u2014runs strong in his veins. My knights could never match his might on the battlefield... Bah!

I just don't understand that guy..."}, {"speaker": "Glade", "line": "So he means to keep womanizing while the people of Tarrah fight for their lives? Damned philanderer... He won't be any help.

The road has been long, but may I present the city of Tarrah\u2014 H-How?! How is this possible? The Empire has already begun their assault!"}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "To arms, then! Tell our forces to charge into Tarrah! We can't abandon the city's people!"}, {"speaker": "Dryas", "line": "I-I must object! The main body of our army has only just now cleared the forest! Our vanguard is all that we have here! That's to say nothing of the enemy's many ballistae! Gods, they practically have more ballistae than men to fire them...! Any of our forces that made for Tarrah's defense now would face... more than their share of danger."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "...I'm aware of the risks. But if we stand here and allow Tarrah to be razed to the ground, our war will be lost before it's even begun! Are you in agreement, August?"}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "I am. If we do nothing to defend Tarrah, we lose the support of the people. Their belief in us will turn to contempt. Our army is still young and vulnerable.
