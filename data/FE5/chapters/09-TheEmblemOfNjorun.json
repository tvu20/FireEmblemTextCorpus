So these bandits are harassing Thracian citizens? Even for your average brigand, that's stupid."}, {"speaker": "Altena", "line": "Exceptionally stupid. Even so, my lord father, you didn't need to come here in person for such a trifle."}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "And what kind of king would I be if I wasn't aware of all the matters that trouble my realm, trifling or no? Besides, it's been too long since you and I had an outing of our own, Altena."}, {"speaker": "Altena", "line": "Indeed, Father. I'm glad we were able to spend time together."}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "Shame that Arion couldn't join us.

The North abounds with crops, and the mountains of the South hide much in the way of resources and riches. An independent Thracia will need both, not just one or the other.

Wasn't this villa supposed to be under the protection of General Hannibal?"}, {"speaker": "August", "line": "Perhaps Thracia finally learned of their presence, or perhaps General Hannibal tipped them off..."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "I'll not hear it, August!
