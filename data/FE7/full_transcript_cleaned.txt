they follow the black fang due south although the trail vanishes lyn uses her tracking skills and the pursuit continues the path leads up into berns impassable mountains the peaks know no seasons and the snow covers all in a bright blanket in this land of blinding reflections an ancient castle appears
so in the end you failed to defeat them didnt you
  
i only introduced you to lord nergal out of respect for your rank i was mistaken though to think that a former royal soldier would be  
next time will be different i swear it i beg of you give me one more chance
ha ha ha  one more chance surely you jest
without lord nergals good word ill never fly again not as a royal wyvern knight at least please another chance
ah but youre quite skilled at begging at least desist you have fallen from our graces and nothing will change that just be grateful you are an outsider so you are spared the fangs judgement
  
you stink of failure leave me to breathe in peace
  hm
that wyvern rider that was the same woman we fought earlier this proves that they took this mountain path
now  what have we here  what a complicated place
its little more than whispers but i can hear human voices
over there lets go take a look
marcus wait here with ninian and everyone else be ready to escape at any time im counting on you
yes sir i will not fail
really youre giving me a mission really and truly mother
i am and its a very big job at that  its for the king of bern
the king such an important job  for me
sonia im against this giving such a dangerous job to this child 
father
 youre right this really is a job for your sons however weve seen nothing of them since their last report
lloyd  linus  
  
so my daughter will do this and i will have no complaints from you about it
  
ah father  
 you may do as you please
but 
first business jaffar come
jaffar
look that man he was at the dragons gate
nergals henchman no question about it
  
jaffar should you be up dont your wounds hurt
  
must you be so discourteous it really is quite irritating you heard the kings request did you not
prince zephiel  he wants him assassinated
what the prince the king wants to kill the prince why hes his son isnt he
nino be quiet
ah  im sorry
jaffar this mission is yours  and youre to take nino
  youre not serious
yes im serious this girl is my daughter she must prove herself as soon as possible
 dont do this this is too much for her
as long as youre with her there should be no problem ill brook no disagreement we must have the king in our debt those are lord nergals explicit orders
  
nino you understand the consequences if you fail dont you
um  yes
then were off to investigate the princes manse ill provide more details on the way there
jerme
yes
where is brendan he just left the room
he went outside with jan
  i wonder what hes about   ill deal with it later listen jerme youre in charge of the guard while im gone do not let anything happen to the item
in charge of the guard  bah i was top dog until that cretin jaffar showed up
jerme
 i know i know
kenneth
yes lady sonia
where is brendan he just left the room
he went outside with jan
  i wonder what hes about   ill deal with it later listen kenneth youre in charge of the guard while im gone do not let anything happen to the item
understood i will guard it with my life
do they seriously mean to assassinate the prince
aye on the orders of the king it would seem unbelievable 
the emblem is essential to the princes ceremony right having the emblem becomes useless if the prince is dead
we must stop the assassination the girl nino  if we speak to her she might understand
jaffar looks like a dangerous man  but we have no other course of action

please sir oswin  i need you to understand i would rather die a knight than live in shame i will trade my life for many of theirs
sir harken did you not swear a life of service to pherae
  
as a knight of ostia it may not be my place to speak but  lord eliwood waited for you  for any of you to return
 lord eliwood
lord eliwood waits for you still we are knights bound by duty to the houses we serve you can still be of service to your lord and master
 you are right sir oswin forgive my weakness my life for my dead lord and for his son eliwood
youre doing much better than i had anticipated but its about time to put an end to this
does this mean  that i lose 
hyaaa ill chop you all up into tiny little pieces
g gwaah  it hurts  these cuts 
everyone is being driven mad by nergal 
it must be terrifying to lose yourself entirely  to fall completely under the sway of nergals power   hey what could this be
it cant be  the fire emblem
so this madman had it all along lets take it and go
weve finally gotten it back  lets not waste our good fortune
eliwood theres no reason for us to stay any longer
i know lets make haste for the manse we must stop the assassination we cannot let the princes life be put in jeopardy
you know your role yes the plan must be carried out tonight
mother just once if only for a little while may i hold your hand
nino you know how i abhor such displays
i  i know but i may not get another chance  and i thought 
 very well
huh
if you complete this mission ill hold your hand as often as you like i will even hug you and stroke your face
oh really then i must do my best i will i will i will succeed wait for me mother
i will be careful
 all right ill be back
ah jaffar wait here for a moment
 
its about tonights mission 
what is it
once youve killed the prince kill nino too
what
the assassinations  both come directly by the kings request the prince is well loved and his death will trigger much chaos if the assassin is not caught and hanged immediately the chaos will engulf bern a scapegoat is needed do you understand
nino is your daughter
she is trash garbage human refuse im just happy at last to have found a use for her she did say she would do anything to please her loving mother did she not her death will please me more than her living ever did
  
 what is it do you have something to say
  this has nothing to do with me
when lord nergal found you as an orphan he chose you because of your callous heart and your skill with a blade lord nergal does not give second chances do not forget
 
 oswin
lord hector
have you heard anything from my brother
when you say anything  
 come you know  about his condition 
no nothing new
i see thats good
why do you ask
no reason really im simply concerned for my brother earlier  when i saw him in ostia he didnt look well when father took ill and died  i wonder if he looked at all like that forget it im worrying about nothing if something were wrong im sure we wouldve heard
yes indeed now that you mention it i did forget something lord uther sent word to you through a messenger
oh what did he have to say
dont trouble lord eliwood by being overly obstinate
just like my brother always the same thing how many times have i told him to stop treating me like a child
/***EOF***/
lyn and her friends have been branded as traitors pretenders to the throne lundgren has sent word to caelins neighbors warning them of lyns approach he calls for reinforcements to put an end to the “imposters” if the other realms of lycia choose to act lyn will never reach caelin alive lyn places her faith in eliwood and waits
ive received word from caelins neighbors laus tuscana kathelet tania and santaruz they will not interfere in caelins affairs this they have promised
eliwood i dont know how to thank you 
all ive done is convince them to remain neutral in this dispute however this means i cannot aid you in any way either will you be all right
i will win i have to its the only way that i can help my grandfather
i understand although i cannot help you directly as a friend i pray for your success
thank you i wont waste the opportunity youve given me
all right everyone lets get going this weather is turning foul it looks like a fog is rolling in
this is no good if the fog thickens well be blind in battle it will be difficult to fight what we cannot see
we cant let it delay us though let us press on we must get closer to the castle whats the best route
let me think  our best path is to the south  however that runs through general eaglers estate it looks like we still have one final obstacle to pass
mark put me in the lead please surely you know that we er thieves if you must can see through fog follow me everyone
so youve come 
aah
you youre  lord wallace
kent who is this
he used to be the commander of the knights of caelin
arent you supposed to be retired i heard you were sowing fields now
i am and i was then i received orders from lord lundgren i was told to capture an imposter and a pair of rogue knights
lord wallace surely you dont believe us to be oathbreakers do you
bring me the girl that claims to be lady madelyns child
what are your intentions
if i dont like what i see i will take her
we will prevent you
you prevent me you must be–
enough im right here i am lyndis
ah 
ill understand if you dont believe me but ive had enough of you and your foolish posturing
hmm  such beautiful eyes 
pardon
ive been a knight for 30 years and here is one thing i learned a person with eyes as bright and true as yours is no deceiver ha ha ha ha ha ha ah yes i like you girl why i believe ill even join your little band of mercenaries
are you  are you serious
this old bulls pledged his loyalty to caelin i would never allow an usurper on the throne lets march
lord wallace he  he hasnt changed at all
i like him hes honest
that he is he deserves our respect
id planned on living out my days in peace on my farm  ah well  it looks as though its time to take up arms once more mark youre the tactician of this group correct what are my orders
wallace is a level 12 knight he can rise as high as level 20 most units can change classes once they reach level 10 by changing classes units can improve all of their abilities movement range constitution usable weapons  everything there are many benefits with a single action you can make your units significantly more powerful in order to change classes units need to be of a certain level however you also need a special item for example wallace is carrying a knight crest with this cavaliers and knights can change classes each character class has its own unique item that allows units of that class to switch to a different class well then why dont we try changing class now select wallace then choose knight crest from his items and use it
mark let wallace show you his might give me an order
ha ha haaa so youve noticed my knight crest have you youve eyes like an eagle my friend once ive used the crest ill be even stronger a terrifying thought isnt it ha ha ha haaaa what are you waiting for order me to use the knight crest
let them stare in awe at my might their knees shall quake order me to use the knight crest
ha ha ha haaaa look a giant walks among you my defense is impenetrable come break your weapons against me
mark  the fogs rolling in we cant hit an enemy we cant see keep your eyes open everyone
hey you  do you have any torches what you dont theres a thick fog rolling in and you have no torches wandering about without a torch is  well its ridiculous here take one of mine use this when its foggy and you can see a bit better hm no no need for thanks i know all about you and your comrades we all well  not one of us believes what lord lundgren is saying about you we all want to help the marquess  and his rightful heir good luck
the forces of caelin are led by general eagler hes an honest man who has always treated us well a good general he must be aware of lundgrens evil plans to seize control of caelin i can only believe lundgrens holding someone dear to him as hostage its so sad but theres nothing anyone can do why must so many innocents get hurt in the foolish games of nobles
imposters to the throne you shall not pass no quarter for traitors
nnng  go  go quickly the marquess  he knows nothing of this  his life is  theres no illness only poison  please for the marquess for all of caelin 
bring forth the imposter who calls herself “lyndis” she shall not pass beyond this place
i am lyndis im no pretender id ask you to believe me but your heart and mind seem set
enough talk  draw your sword
general eagler 
sain  i never imagined you could turn traitor 
whos the traitor here i am following the orders of my sworn liege lord not lundgren but my true liege the marquess himself
you speak with conviction i think its time to test the bounds of loyalty
kent is that you
general eagler we found lady lyndis on the orders of the marquess weve worked so very hard to return her safely to caelin
and yet you have no proof of the girls identity is that not true
yes but 
then our talk is finished draw your weapon and come
eagler
general wallace  so youve sided with the girl too have you
i fight for caelins honor not for lundgrens lies
ah  is that so you are– enough theres nothing more to be said i name you traitors all come do your worst
fool  at the very least let mine be the blow that finishes you
what kind of man was general eagler
when sain and i first became knights he was our captain our teacher 
i think he must have known we were telling the truth why did he force the fight
something must have  lord lundgren was exerting some hold on him  eagler was trying to protect someone a friend perhaps or family
  
may lundgren never know the peaceful embrace of mother earth i care not what others do i will stop that man mark the final battle is approaching
how are you feeling today my dear brother
lundgren  you  you fiend 
your granddaughter is dead by now and soon you will join her
lyndis  why did this happen i  i only wanted to see her once
have you lost all hope has your life lost all meaning then hurry up and die you miserable old dotard you and your precious granddaughter are in my way i curse your name i despise you my worthless wretch of a brother
/***EOF***/

in laus erik tells eliwood of a plan a plot to use laus as starting ground in a rebellion against ostia eliwood needs proof to believe these accusations and so he and his allies pursue darin the fleeing marquess of laus where that chase would lead eliwood could not have known
after repelling the mercenary forces of eubans hector prepares to mount a pursuit of marquess laus lord darin and his knights are with the instigator of the rebellion the enigmatic ephidel hector learns where the fugitives were traveling from ostias network of spies however their final destination still remains unknown 
blast where on earth has that snake darin gone
i doubt hes left lycia yet but  hector its been five days the death of marquess santaruz  our attack on laus castle  word of these things must have reached lord uther by now and yet he shows no sign of action  why
im sure he has his reasons my brother has other concerns tying his hands right now
what do you mean
its bern weve received disturbing reports over the past few months king desmond is behaving oddly if he sees even the slightest crack in lycias defenses we believe hell invade with all of berns might behind him my brother has only recently become marquess as well as head of the lycian league he cant allow another country to see weakness or discord
he has to present the face of stability and strength is that it
yes it seems every country has a spy working in ostia right now they all want to assess the new marquesss temperament and skill if they sense anything wrong word will spread like wildfire
hector youre the marquesss brother  would not being at his side be seen as something “wrong”
the marquesss brother is a well known lout if i were at court theyd sense something wrong
youre not too proud of that reputation are you
not in the least
lord hector lord eliwood
what is it oswin have you heard something
yes my lord a messenger from the east castle caelin has fallen to a surprise attack from marquess laus
castle caelin
theyve struck again
lord hausen  is he unharmed
my apologies my lord  weve no word on lord hausen or his granddaughter the lady lyndis
i never imagined they would attack caelin  lord hausen  lyndis 
lord hector  what should we do
they might still be alive right theres only one thing we can do
hector
come on weve got to hurry
milady ive returned and i have brought news laus soldiers are scattered from the castle to the edge of this forest there must be at least 50 soldiers
are you sure about this milady we barely escaped  going back to the castle would mean almost certain death
my grandfather is in the castle i left the castle on his orders but  i cant leave him in there alone
the numbers we face  rescuing lord hausen will be no easy task
i wonder if we can expect any reinforcements
i overheard some of the laus soldiers talking they claim that lord eliwood invaded laus and drove them out
eliwood why would he attack laus
it gets even more interesting  not only did marquess laus abandon his castle but he also left his son erik behind when he fled here to caelin
thats despicable he abandoned his own son
but at least we know eliwood is in laus we might be able to ask him for help  assuming there were a way to contact him
if we are to avoid being caught the best path would be through the forest shall i go
i suspect youre right horses cannot move well in woods  itll take you a while but you can travel lightly 
lady lyndis ill go i can fly above the forest i can be in laus faster than anyone else
florina you cant do this on your own its not possible
thanks to my time here im no longer as timid around men as i used to be and ive met lord eliwood before im sure i can do this on my own
it will be terribly dangerous  you understand dont you
yes but  i promised myself i would become braver for you im not the weak little florina i used to be ill be fine trust me
youve convinced me the jobs yours florina but you must promise me that you wont try anything impossible
yes my lady farewell
did you hear our meek florina she sounded most forceful beautiful
shes become a full fledged pegasus knight
yes she has
all for you lady lyndis thats quite gallant
when we lived on the plains i was always her protector i know i shouldnt feel sad and yet

thank you eliwood if not for your help i dont know where id be right now
all of this happened because we routed lord darin at laus its only right that we help

thank you however until your castle is yours again i take responsibility
i understand thank you
eliwood were moving into the castle

oh yes let me introduce you hector
what
this is lyndis shes lord hausens granddaughter lyndis this is hector hes lord uthers brother
his brother really
yes
i was watching the way he fights  hes not like you eliwood hes somewhat like my own knights but different still he relies so much on power its like hes never been 
i havent i taught myself how to fight
ive no issue with that but the way you swing that axe around  youre a threat to your allies you should be more watchful
what did you say
lyndis whats come over you
hm oh i  my apologies i didnt intend to seem so critical
  
granted hectors style may be a tad dangerous but  theres no one i depend on more you may think him careless but hes always aware of his surroundings
the more you praise me the less worthy i sound
lyndis once you fight alongside hector im sure youll understand
im sure youre right i apologize hector im honored to have your help
no apology necessary im glad i can lend a hand
lets go inside shall we
mark is it really you mark so good to see you have you been well
well met mark good to see you again
well this really is a pleasant surprise
hello mark has it really been a year
whats wrong florina you neednt hide back there
um  nice to see you again i dont suppose you  do you remember me
everyone who remained in caelin speaks of you fondly were always saying “i wonder where mark is ” yes youre right this isnt the best time to catch up were here to rescue my grandfather mark will you help me again
ri ridiculous  even bauker
lord darin its time to give up this madness further resistance is meaningless for what youve done you may never be forgiven but its not too late to try tell eliwood everything hell intervene with marquess ostia on your behalf 
i ive lost 
hurry eliwood will be here in no time let me speak for you gurr  guaaaa
none of that now marquess laus needs no troublesome advice
l lord ephidel
there is no turning back for you now you should know that first marquess santaruz  and now marquess caelin both deaths are on your head
what it was by your hand that they both died i i never asked for this
yes i killed them  for you
to trap me
dont be absurd i follow my masters orders my only wish is to deliver your dreams to you the crown of a united lycia  and once that is done dominion over the entire continent is that not what you desire
     yes yes of course that dream is still worth a few sacrifices isnt it
youre exactly right our plans may have gone drastically awry but as long as we have the masters power behind us we cannot be defeated wed do well to leave now before those meddlesome worms arrive you will leave everyone from laus behind we will use them to delay our foe
everyone  my soldiers but who will protect me
the black fang and i will more than suffice for that task there is nothing else you need i assure you
yes i i see that now where do we go from here
to the dragons gate  our master awaits us there the master has informed me our hostage may be all we need if all goes well we may be able to perform the ceremony with him alone
oh is that so i suppose weve nothing to worry about
that is correct now please begin your retreat i have two or three orders to give then i will be right behind you
pathetic imbecile  leila where are you
im here
while eliwood is occupied finish off marquess caelin and hide the body the enemy will waste precious time searching for him
as you command 
you know youve only been with the black fang a short while however you are quite skilled  i look forward to watching you
yes sir
ah you there youre caelin knights arent you marquess lauss man the one called bauker  he seems like a gentle man but his skill is near legendary do you carry weapons suited to battling knights take this if you please
different shops carry different items for sale if you find something youve never seen you should buy it just to try by the way have you been to the local shop if not you should drop in my daughter runs the place
youre all caelin knights are you not what lord hausens still in the castle oh  this was to be for our daughters wedding but  here please help marquess caelin our lord needs rescuing
weapons are only as strong as the material theyre made of most of the weapons you have now are made of iron right iron is a poor match for steel and poorer still for silver slim weapons are weaker than iron ones but easier to wield good weapons are expensive but theyre worth the cost
your company seems close knit its vital to have friends who support and assist you isnt it you have to be close to someone if you really want to get along stay close to those with whome youre compatible to strengthen your bond a reading by a fortune teller will tell you who youre compatible with but dont become so concerned about it that you forget to fight
/***EOF***/
a mountain cave on the outskirts of ostia here a sacred weapon lies waiting the seal guarding it broken however to retrieve the weapon one must pass a trial a long seemingly uncrossable distance  eliwood must overcome the challenge with the help of his friends eliwoods true strength will soon be sorely tested
ah sweet ninian this time you will open the gate
  
so you intend to resist me to the end you only joined me to postpone your own friends deaths did you you never had any intention of offering your aid freely
  
 heh heh heh  whether you wish it or not it is all the same to me i will call forth a dragon and claims its quintessence i will harness a power never before seen on this world and i will become this worlds master that is my desire ninian you are but a tool to help me achieve that end
 i dont want to help you i  i dont want to do it
dont want to you are truly amusing my dear i am not looking for your consent you are weak and i am strong you will bend before me
no 
its the same as when i sacrificed eliwoods father with enough energy i do not need your acquiescence come ninian open the gate
no no  no  nooooooooo
so at least  your true form  is liberated hmph to where do you hope to run beast youll never be human why do you cling to them so what would eliwood say if he saw your hideous form ninian for one such as you there will never be a place you can call your home
 i never imagined there could be a place like this in lycia 
the air is so hot it even hurts to breathe
look down there theres lava everywhere hey next to the path  are those columns of flame
long ago in the depths of this cavern  when lycia was a single country an altar was built
here in this place
theres something here that needs protection from those with evil hearts
durandal right
thats correct the weapons we wielded contained great strength power fearsome enough to cut down dragons  today the might in those remaining weapons is not what it once was yet they have been safeguarded to keep them from evil hands this place  no ones stepped foot in here since rolands death rolands presence still fills the air all that reside here now are former soldiers who guard the sword this is your trial eliwood a few of you may enter but only you can approach the altar go and prove that you have the strength to wield durandal
listen mark you know how eliwood is never wants to burden anyone else  takes all responsibility on himself  now more than ever we have to support him lets go mark
 i am one of  sir rolands  warriors georg  you trespass here  i will cut you down 
    i dont understand  you seem familiar   who are you   you and  sir roland are as one 
 you have stood your guard for so so long im sorry 
their souls may now rest  at long last 
 mm
time for a reunion of sorts eliwood move back
my old friend  the little knight sir roland
roland  awaken and answer my call
 my friend  wise all seeing athos 
good to see you roland
i feel much time has passed seeing you again  it brings back memories fighting the dragons  old friends  all this time lost in memory 
its been almost a thousand years and yet once again the world is threatened by one who craves the might of dragons
 the might of dragons
heed my words roland this boy is descended from your blood please lend him your strength
i no longer have flesh and bone in this world i cannot  no wait take this its blade shall serve as a vessel for my souls strength
 if you do such a thing you will pass forever from the reach of this world
and yet my heart will be glad if i might help my children there is nothing else i need do  i ask that you see this through my friend 
i will 
lord athos who was that man
so you were able to see him too that was your ancestor the warrior roland
that was roland
look above the altar a sword 
take it it belongs to you now
 what a wondrous blade
durandal the sword of sacred fire
so this is the legendary blade 
durandal the sword of sacred fire
 its strange isnt it ive never seen it before and yet it feels so familiar 
i will use this to battle nergal come to the dragons gate  what the sword  its glowing  watch out somethings coming 
it cant be 
its a dragon
no how is it possible
get back everyone
eliwood are you all right
i think so  my body moved on its own it was as if the sword itself was guiding my arm
the sword of sacred fire was made to combat dragons with so much power who can say what it might be capable of but this ice dragon  surely 
is something the matter lord athos 
no 
let me be the one to answer that
blackheart nergal
ninian proved useless ive come for a replacement
nils
dont waste your breath he wont be awake for some time nils will do for me what ninian would not
scum what have you done with ninian
its not what ive done its what youve done eliwood
what
eliwood did you never once question it why the siblings were needed to open the dragons gate why did it have to be ninian and nils
  
the answer is simple the dragons gate cannot be opened by humans why would humans be able to open a gate that was designed for dragons
 what
its pitiful really poor ninians plight coaxed by my honeyed words she passed through the gate  though unable to return home she refused to aid me and wandered lost and alone until she was slain by the hand of the one she loved
what  what are you saying
can you not guess or is it that you are afraid to know very well let me tell you eliwood the ice dragon there  the beast slaughtered by your hand  that is ninian the girl who adored you she returned to her true form and lost all human memory yet you above all else remained in her heart and she came here  look upon the creature you have slain that is ninian
 ah 
go on look shes using the last of her strength to take human form for one last time i believe there may be still be time enough to say farewell you know of course that you cannot save her
nergal you foul demon 
its not me you eliwood you killed her you  
i  aaaaaaahhh
calm down get hold of yourself eliwood
i  i  
lo lord eliwood 
 ninian
 ah 
ninian ninian
eliwood 
ninian  please dont die  i  what have i done
im glad 
what
that you are unharmed my lord  im so glad 
 ninian  ninian you cant  answer me  niniaaaaaaan
thats enough you will await the end of the world trembling in the shadow of dragons
i will not permit it instead i will see you perish in flame
the purest fire  flame breath very impressive archsage athos however  however fire is no longer my foe look not even a legendary blade can cause me harm at long last i am impervious ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
 gaa 
miserable arent you athos yet out of respect for the great man you used to be ill leave after all 500 years ago we followed the same path did we not old friend ha ha ha ha ha
what do we do now not even legendary weapons can stop him
 unh   
nils youre awake are you ok
 ninian   ninian  ninian where is my 
 
  
 nils   im so sorry
 uuh  aaaaaaaaaa

the apprentice tactician mark and the young swordfighter lyn a strange pair on an even stranger journey to prepare for the long road ahead they go to bulgar the commercial center of sacae unbeknownst to lyn she will discover something that will alter her life forever
mark over here this is bulgar the biggest city in all of sacae we should purchase supplies for our journey
oh my heart what a dazzling vision of loveliness
hm
wait o beauteous one would you not favour me with your name or better yet your company
where are you from sir knight that you speak so freely to a stranger
ha i thought youd never ask i am from lycia i hail from the caelin canton home to men of passion and fire
shouldnt that be home to callow oafs with loose tongues
ooooh  youre even lovely when youre cruel
lets go mark i‘ve nothing more to say
wait please 
sain hold your tongue
ah kent my boon companion why so severe an expression
if your manner were more serious i wouldnt have to be so severe we still have a mission to complete sain
i know that but how could i remain silent in the presence of such beauty it would have been discourteous
what do you know about courtesy
excuse me youre blocking the road if you would be so kind as to move your horses 
of course my apologies 
thank you you at least seem honourable enough
hm pardon me but  i feel weve met before
i beg your pardon
hey no fair kent i saw her first
tsk it seems there are no decent men among lycias knights lets go mark ive run out of patience
wait please its not like that    sain you lout
huh not like that i thought you were 
i am not you come we must follow her i suspect she might be—
be what shes our mission youre joking wait
run were being pursued could it be those knights from town no  its not them these men are out for blood
   
heh heh hehhh  arent you the pretty one your name is lyndis is it not
what did you call me  who are you
such a waste an absolute waste the things id do for gold  ah well time to die darlin cmon out boys
oh no there are more than i can handle  but ill not give up
hey there she is
huh
what
whew  finally caught up  hold you there what is your business such numbers against a girl cowards every one of you
you youre from—
we can discuss that later it appears these ruffians mean to do you harm if its a fight they want let them look to me
stand back ill take care of this
no this is my fight stay out of my way
well i cant just stand here and do nothing 
i have a solution you there command us i am kent a knight of lycia my companion is sain we will follow your orders in this battle is that acceptable milady
yes it is mark and i will lead lets go
you you are called tactician i want to impress my beauteous one let me attack first
direct my arm
o fair and beauteous one and  tactician is it allow me to show you the might of a knight of lycia let me be the first to strike a blow in your honor
sain is your faithful servant command me
blue units are allies direct them on the field as you did with lyn before be warned if lyn is defeated your journey is over as is your game if other blue units are beaten the game will continue but fallen companions will be unable to return to battle for the rest of the tutorial use caution and good judgement after all blue units have been moved it automatically becomes the enemys turn to begin with select sain place the cursor on sain and press the a button
attack move me to a space next to my foe
move me up next to the enemy
whoa i missed
sain why arent you using your sword
the lance is more heroic a knight should look heroic dont you think
youre hopeless if you dont take fighting more seriously youre going to find yourself on the end of a blade
truth be told i forgot to buy a sword
forgot or were you simply too busy dallying with the ladies
dont be so mad ill be fine with a lance im that good
id prefer to rely on your skill not your empty bragging take my spare blade and use it to attack next time
are you sure my thanks kent
youre almost more trouble than youre worth almost
tactician allow me to make up for my companions blunder i am at your command
weapons possess a unique hierarchy swords best axes axes best lances lances best swords this is called the weapon triangle remembering this is of the utmost importance first lets illustrate that swords are strong against axes select kent
command me to attack
the enemy wields an axe use a sword for my attack
hes almost defeated now lets deliver the final blow
i must be next to the enemy
i want to fight i must be closer to my foe
tactician give me another chance
i failed you once before but give me another chance  ill not fail you again
move next to the enemy and attack
axe wielding foes should be met with swords brandish your blade
gah
sain are you all right
yes yes i am i was able to dodge in time i cant believe he evaded my sword stroke so easily this is no jest
look closely the enemy is hidden in the woods the branches make it difficult to attack dont they
youre right i was so focused on attacking  i didnt see
your lack of attention may someday cost you your life
fine i understand already let it go kent
if you truly understand then act like it
kent worries too much  hes going to grow old before his time
each type of terrain has unique characteristics for example look at woods and plains battle an enemy from the woods and the enemy will probably miss you however your attacks will be unimpeded giving you a distinct advantage the same is true for foes if an enemy is in the woods he is more difficult to hit factoring in your terrain benefits and the weapon triangle is vital in combat the window at the bottom of the screen gives information on the terrain the cursor is placed on check to see what terrain type is advantageous by using the cursor now lets put this to the test select kent
im ready for battle command me as you will
move me next to the enemy
lets use my sword to attack
it seems like a wise decision to leave that bandit to the knights
for my part if im going to take care of the other foe ill need to close the distance between us the knight said that woods are advantageous right in that case 
that looks good lets move there tactician
you  your name is sain right
yes sain the gallant of caelin thats me
if you insist  why have you not healed yourself
huh hey ive been injured what a cad i am to wrinkle that perfect brow of yours with worry for me 
uh  i was thinking of giving you a vulnerary but  it looks like youre fine so never you mind
no wait ill take it please ill take it
to give away an item use the trade command trade can only be used by units that are adjacent to one another lets use the trade command right now select sain and move him next to lyn
i must use the vulnerary and put my ladys mind at ease tactician bring me to her
i mustnt worry my lady any longer come tactician direct me to her
i cant keep such a generous offer waiting the healing power of love awaits with yon angel tactician tarry no longer
move me next to her i implore you
now select the trade command sains and lyns possessions will be displayed together use the cursor to select a vulnerary from lyns items and give it to sain after you finished your trade press the b button to end the process the b button is the cancel button it can be used to rescind mistaken commands and other things
place the cursor on lyns items press right on the  control pad
press up or down on the  control pad and select a vulnerary then press the a button
press the a button to accept the vulnerary from lyn
press the b button to stop trading
sain can now use lyns vulnerary select the vulnerary from the items and use it
furthermore mounted units have the unique ability to move again essentially this allows cavalry to move the number of spaces left in their movement range if they havent done so already however the attack command among others nullifies the move again ability so be careful select sain and order him to move again
ah much better thanks tactician and you have my gratitude as well my angel
 
ah much better you have my gratitude young ladies
mission goals change from chapter to chapter this chapters goal is to defeat all enemies check the chapter goals in the window to the upper right of the screen to open the map menu place the cursor on an unoccupied space and press the a button you can confirm the chapter goals here by choosing status from the menu the map menu also has the suspend command this is useful if you have to stop a chapter midway time to continue this chapter best of luck
accursed knights always tampering in others affairs
blast  there was only supposed to be a lone girl 
thats the last of them fantastic work mark
and now for these knights of lycia you were going to share your story with me
yes we have ventured from caelin in lycia in search of someone
lycia  thats the country beyond the mountains in the south west isnt it
correct weve come as messengers to the lady madelyn who eloped with a nomad some 19 years ago
madelyn
our lord the marquess of caelins only daughter he was heartbroken his own daughter would abandon him so eventually the marquess simply declared that he had no daughter
and then this year we received a letter from lady madelyn it said she her husband and their daughter were living happily on the sacae plains the marquess was ecstatic to learn he had a granddaughter of 18 years i remember the smile on his face when he announced that hed suddenly become a grandfather the granddaughters name is lyndis this was also the name of the marquesss wife who passed away at an early age
lyndis
that she should bear this name thawed the marquesss heart now his only wish is to meet his daughters family at least once this is why were here we didnt know that lady madelyn died a few days after sending her letter  we only learnt this shortly after arriving here in bulgar
but we also learned all was not lost her daughter yet lives we heard that she was living alone on the plains  i  i knew it immediately you are the lady lyndis
why would you think that 
your resemblance to your departed mother is remarkable
what did you know my mother
im sorry to say that i never met her directly but i saw her portraits in castle caelin
to the rest of my tribe i was always lyn but when i was with my parents  when it was just the three of us i was lyndis its all so strange i was all alone in the world and now i have a grandfather lyndis  i never thought i would hear that name again
 
wait that bandit he called me lyndis too
what how could he have–
he was a henchman of lord lundgren wasnt he
lundgren whos that
hes the marquesss younger brother everyone assumed the lady madelyn was gone forever this made lord lundgren heir to the marquesss title
to be blunt milady your existence is an obstacle to your granduncles ambitions
thats– but i have no interest in inheriting any title
unfortunately your granduncle is not the sort of man to believe that i believe the attempts on your life will persist
what should i do
accompany us to caelin continuing on this way is dangerous
i feel i have little choice i will go with you
mark  im sorry this changes everything what do you want me to do mark you  want me to decide of course your companionship would do much to ease my journey but  its going to be so dangerous
youll come are you sure thank you let me ask once again for your friendship and your aid

i know mother please do not worry father is alive i know it i vow that i will find him and return him to your side
i have your word then
yes of course isadora i entrust my mother to you in my absence
yes milord i will guard over her well
mother i will return rest easy
well marcus it looks like its just the two of us
not so milord my man lowen will be traveling with us
lowen thats reassuring
ive sent him ahead to the village he hopes to seek out a few able men who are skilled at arms normally i wouldnt venture forth without a larger company but  i bow to your will on this matter lord eliwood
im sorry marcus but i would rather not deprive my mother of even a single guard the best knights in the realm disappeared with my father if anything were to happen to my mother while i am gone i 
i understand milord hmph whats keeping lowen
weve all heard that the knights of pherae have vanished right well your misfortune is my good luck i have an announcement to make as of now this village is mine groznyi is your new liege now bring every last piece of gold down to the smallest fleck
lord eliwood co commander marcus i 
lowen calm yourself a knight must be in control at all times
the village is under attack its bandits
what bandits here
are you sure lowen
this girl has more details
my lord eliwood im the daughter of the village magistrate my names rebecca the bandits came without warning theyre stealing everything i beg you please help us
i see marcus lowen we must aid the village
yes milord
rebecca stay here and keep out of sight
if it please you milord i would rather fight i hunt almost every day and i have some skill with a bow
is that so very well but be careful
yes milord
lord eliwood one more thing there is another in the village who has offered to help a traveling tactician who was staying at the inn
a tactician
yes milord this is mark
mark
do you know this person milord
yes i met mark during the trouble in caelin last year a fantastic military advisor if memory serves if not for mark the marquess of caelin and his granddaughter lyn might not have survived lundgrens uprising what brings you to pherae my friend ha still traveling about honing your skills of course  a worthy pursuit lets give thanks to providence for our chance reunion we have need of your aid please lend us your skill
look dorcas can you believe it its just like that knight said thats lord eliwood
so it seems
whats he doing hey hes taking on those bandits protecting innocents thats a right lordly thing to do isnt it right dorcas
you talk too much the lordling needs our help
right leave these mountain weaklings to me im bartre the brave
is lord elbert well weve heard nothing but foul rumors hereabouts  all of pherae is worried for his well being we hear tell that lord eliwood is going to find the marquess this dragon shield is our village treasure  it boosts the defenses of the one who uses it take it please and may it see you and lord elbert home safely
theres a young traveler been stayin with the magistrate been stayin in the village for a few days now i know youre thinkin its just another good for nothing courtier lookin for a handout but theres somethin more to this one  those eyes  they miss nothing got a mission that one has
youve got some skill with weapons but do you understand weapon levels the more you use a weapon the more skilled you become still you can only reach the highest level with a single weapon
what is this a pack of children coming to play you think you can challenge me what pheraen knights but thats impossible
ugh  i thought my luck  was finally turning around 
ah you would be lord eliwood yes our deepest thanks for coming to the aid of our fair village
think nothing of it its a lords duty to protect the citizenry
would that were true milord the good folk of laus know no such protection their marquess lord darin is too busy preparing for war he ignores all complaints of bandits and thieves
preparing for war are you sure
i would not lie milord my brother lived in laus until a few days ago his home was torched and he had no choice but to flee here according to him laus could go to war any day now its all the people of laus are talking about
lord eliwood if this is true the situation is a grave one if marquess laus is readying for war  his target is most likely another lycian territory perhaps this is connected to lord elberts disappearance
my father and marquess laus it seems a tenuous connection but its as good a start as any let us travel to laus we must learn more
thank you for your guidance mark where are you bound for next if you have no destination in mind perhaps you could travel with us ours is a small group with a single purpose–to find my father i do not know where our road will lead but  we would be stronger with you in our company you will travel with us splendid thank you i pray we give you no cause to regret your decision
rebecca where do you think youre going young lady
father i  i intend to accompany lord eliwood
dont be ridiculous girl lord eliwood is not going on a picnic hes riding into danger
i know that father thats why i want to go we owe him our lives and i want to repay him my bow may not be all that much but i know i can be of service
but 
and father  i may meet up with my brother somewhere youre the magistrate–you have responsibilities i  this is all i can offer i need to do this please father let me go
dear me  youre just as stubborn as your mother was
im sorry father 
you must bow to lord eliwoods wishes on this matter if he consents you may go
thank you father
lord elbert has always been kind to us follow his son with a true heart rebecca serve lord eliwood well as i have served his father
i will father

 dragon
/***EOF***/
ninian is dead now only nergals echoing laughter remains  on hectors advice the group heads toward ostia they are weary to the bone and they need time to regroup ostia is the most heavily guarded fortress city in all of lycia no enemy should have been able to breach its walls
look at that bowmen as far as the eye can see mark do you have something against me heh you know better than that let me tell you vaida is not your average wyvern rider mark sit back and watch me perform
wow why do there have to be so many archers oh well  as long as ive been paid i cant complain this is my chance to show you what farina of the great wing can do but listen mark  this goes beyond hazard pay
lord hector were pleased to see you home alive and well
wheres my brother
ah  he departed yesterday for a conference in etruria hes scheduled to return in a half months time
 etruria thats a pity go and prepare rooms for my companions they need rest
yes my lord
my brothers away  oswin did you know about this
uh  yes i was aware of his trip
why did he choose to go to etruria now i dont get it its not like him
  
graybeard you know something dont you tell me what are we supposed to do now
a moment lad  yes i suppose youve a right to know   i first met nergal some 500 years ago wandering the nabata wasteland like me his only drive was the search for truth in this world we were equals in power and knowledge and we became fast friends we believed we could solve the mysteries of the world we truly believed 
so what happened
a disagreement made at the height of our quest one day as i charted the mysteries of nabata i came across the most amazing village  it was unbelievable but in that place humans and dragons lived together in cooperation
dragons and humans are you telling me they could live together in peace
at first i doubted what my own eyes showed me but yes the village truly did exist
thats   amazing
the dragons that i beheld there  they were both similar to and different from the dragons i had fought hundreds of years before
 ah eliwood are you 
   please go on 
 as you wish they had refused to fight humans in the war and instead they retreated to this wasteland they desired nothing but to remain hidden from the outside nergal and i crafted a barrier and created an oasis for them upon their invitation we lived there with them our life there  it was calm and satisfying at some point the village became known as arcadia a place of perfect peace for travelers gone astray
arcadia 
the dragons libraries were a dream come true to us we studied their language and history with unbridled passion a century then two  time passed in an eyes blink and yet slowly our thoughts turned down different paths
in what way
i wanted to share the dragons wisdom with others my hope was for our earthly paradise to spread outward
and nergal
ah nergal  he took the dragons knowledge  he learned the art of stealing the essence from living creatures and turning it into power  it was terrible when we discovered what he was doing the elders and i tried to persuade him to stop but the power bewitched him and he was deaf to our pleas he started with small creatures and grew ever more confident then he began draining the quintessence of humans the villagers and i joined forces and defeated him or so we thought but 
  
after he was banished from arcadia nergal fled to bern he increased his power slowly to avoid our eye using quintessence he made his puppets the morphs theyre bewitching in form with intellects beyond human im sure youve laid eyes on them yourselves jet black hair pale complexion and blood red lips  their most striking features are their glittering gold eyes
attack were under attack
what
l lord hector its bad an unknown group has breached the castle walls
how did they get in the castle without anyone noticing them
they just appeared out of nowhere the attack was so sudden the castle guards were annihilated
castle ostia is famed far and wide as being impregnable  if its been breached so easily can we save it
its nergal his magic created an entrance for his thugs within the castle
blast that arrogant– no matter what the throne must be protected ill not let the castle fall while my brothers away
hold on hector im going with you
  
mark we need you we need a plan if we can hold them back for a while reinforcements will come
this is a message from lord nergal “i await you on the dread isle”
tell all the soldiers take your posts and dont move hold your positions all we can do is hold on until reinforcements arrive
eliwood
what
dont overexert yourself
im fine  im not that weak

you youre one of lord hectors guests arent you you shouldnt be out here its too dangerous go and hide in that room do you understand
   
lord hector are you unharmed protect lord hector knights of ostia attack
hey graybeard are these guys 
yes im sure of it they are his morphs 
its true  theyre all eerily similar that reminds me  that man on valor ephidel  black fangs sonia too  are you saying that he made them all
it is an abomination a crime against all that is natural when nergal began using morphs to carry out his plans his power had grown beyond our ability to contain him after humans his next target became the essence of dragons his next target had to be arcadia i concealed our paradise behind a curtain of sandstorms i then hid in the underground ruins and waited for him i did not hope to defeat him just to exchange blows  and then draw him into the desert which would be his end
but nergal never showed up did he
correct ive no idea how he managed it but  he called those siblings through the dragons gate and now  he plans to call a horde of dragons to this land
what do we have to do to stop him
our last hope is the power of the legendary items it would take too long for us to gather all of them i will go to the shrine of seals and tell bramimond everything we must have his power no matter the cost
then we should go to the dragons gate ahead of you
what
thats a good idea even though you cannot harm nergal himself you can certainly do some damage to his troops
if we dont answer nergals invitation soon  hell continue to send out troops after us if thats going to happen we might as well take the fight to him i wont have lycia ravaged by any more of his acts
 you  you truly are rolands children i am old  i did not expect anything to surprise me again and yet 
 lord athos
it takes the strongest of bonds to alter the course of fate go  go my youthful friends set your sights on the dragons gate and keep moving  eliwood hector where are the legendary items
theyre right here
mine too im sorry  i simply couldnt bring myself to wield it
neither could i  eliwood said it felt like durandal moved by itself a weapon with a will of its own can i really control a weapon like that frankly i wasnt sure
let me take them from you for a while may i
yes
its fine but 
eliwood hector i understand how you both feel but without these weapons we wont be able to stop nergal  you know that dont you
 yes when next i wield it  i wont hesitate
confidence is just a matter of time ill use it when i need to youll see graybeard
i know
 oswin
im here lord hector we wont be able to contact fargus about traveling to valor til the day after tomorrow the guards are rotating watches to protect the castle lord hector for this one night please get some rest
who needs rest do not talk to me of rest when ostia needs me there is something that you need to tell me isnt there
i can think of nothing my lord
stop this foolishness its plain that everyone is avoiding me what youre all hiding  i know what it is
lord hector you must calm yourself
say it i command you tell me what has happened
  
 if you dont answer right here right now i will cut you down knave
 do as you must

  
  i see  my brother  hes gone isnt he
lord hector
i was sure  he was recuperating  that hed gone somewhere to recover his strength i thought that was what you were hiding  but  you wont confess even now   that means  
lord hector wait please  
welcome home master
limstella look at this
the childrens dragon stone what will you do with it
i will infuse it with quintessence
this is 
the dragon girl  ninians essence beautiful  absolutely beautiful   with this i will be able to call dragons whenever i please
shall we begin the process right away
no i lost some quintessence from the injuries i took from athos to summon the numbers i need i must have more essence one must be fully prepared when dealing with dragons if they wrested free from my control and killed me all would be for naught
i fear to report  that the quintessence from the black fang has all been used where shall the next harvest come from
heh heh heh  all the materials we need are heading this way even now
 i see eliwood and friends
thats right i will crush them steal their essences and call forth my dragons heh heh heh  haaa haa haha haha hah

after speaking with the ostian spy leila eliwood realizes he must travel to valor the dread isle the small island located south of lyica is said to be home to the dragons gate heading for the southern coast of caelin they seek passage in the port of badon
listen we need a boat to valor
you want a boat to the dread isle youre mad no way never theres no one in this village wholl sail there
please were in a hurry can you give us passage

you must be on urgent business thats certain   there may be one way 
what is it tell us please
pirates
eh pirates
uh huh theyre fearless or as close as makes no difference and theyll go anywhere for a fee who knows they might decide to accept your mad offer
pirates  looks like weve no choice
are you serious hector working with pirates thats unbelievable youre considering it arent you eliwood
if theres no other way what else can we do
you too eliwood ive misjudged you  its foolishness to trust the goodwill of pirates im finding another way lyn leaves
why is she so angry
i heard that lyndiss parents were slain by bandits bandits at land pirates at sea  theyre all the same to lyndis lawbreakers and murderers
i see  my parents died of illness  but i can appreciate her feelings shall we abandon the pirate plan
but 
too bad about the girl but theres no other way
lets meet the pirates we cant decide until then
thats true
that inn over there is a known favorite of the local freebooters theyre reckless and unpredictable best be prepared
what do you want whelps youre here to see me arent you
youre commander of the pirate armada arent you
gwah hah hah commander of the pirate armada i like the sound of that are you lads that naive or are you just dumb which is it
you insolent 
peace hector
if ive insulted you i apologize how should i address you
hmph  you dont frighten easily do you well at least it seems youre not stupid captain will do whelp im fargus captain of the davros
fargus  master fargus or should i call you captain
youre not one of my mates call me fargus now what do you want
we want to book passage to valor
how much will you pay
we dont know the current rates tell us how much you want
100000 gold
wait 100000 gold
well will you pay
weve no choice but we need a little time well get the gold and return as quickly as possible come hector
wa wait a moment eliwood
eliwood hold on where do you think youre going to get 100000 gold
im sure theres an arena here we can raise gold somehow 
what youre not serious
weve no other way do we
well no steps back sometimes you surprise me eliwood
did you say something hector
no nothing lets go earn some gold
appears ahoy hold your ground boys
what now we dont have the money yet
fool of course you dont i know that the captains got a message for you
a message
all of my mates in this village are going to attack you if you can beat us all and get to the ship unharmed hell give you passage
for free no gold
the captains a tad off kilter hed rather have a bit o fun with you than take your gold smooth sailing to you
hey landlubbers over here im over here
oh for  this is a joke isnt it
looks serious enough here we go
listen the captains waiting at the docks talk to him and youre the winner trust me though  dont make the mistake of attacking him you anger the captain and theres no turning back dont forget
comes out of a nearby house i couldnt find a ship after all but we have to get to that island  looks like ill have to endure pirates hm what was that commotion in the village
oh lyn nice timing we need your help
youre battling the pirates
fighting and  look we have to reach the docks and speak to the captain this is a test to see whether or not hell give us passage
i dont understand but  im here so let me help
good to see you again mark our reunion is surely the work of blessed elimine im most pleased to travel with you once more your commands please
so youre the tactician huh im raven im just a mercenary i work for these guys now so it looks like ill take your orders what are you waiting for what do you need me to do
what mooncalves i wouldve just let them sit there if they hadnt come any closer rush em boys
pardon me i was speaking with an old sailor a few moments ago he told me that youre planning to travel to valor is that so really and thats why youre playing tag with these pirates   i see in that case would you mind if i joined you my name is canas im a scholar of sorts  ive been seeking passage to valor but none will take me my proposal probably sounds somewhat selfish no you should know i can help in combat ive some skill with a form of elder magic  some call it dark magic a rather biased term if i must be blunt but at the very least i can take care of myself and perhaps others
i heard about your contest with the pirate captain fargus youve got nerve ill give you that let me give you some advice dont try to overpower the pirates take the narrow path next to us and follow the wall toward the sea pass in front of the last house and stay close to the sea wall you should be able to get to fargus and win your game why do i know all this well my sweeties a pirate his names jake and hes the best if you see him tell him annas worried about him
what an interesting diversion maybe we should join in lord eliwood of pherae  you dont yet know to fear the black fang start grieving for i will teach you that fear
youre about to die scream if you must
gaa ha  crow in triumph  youve–
hey there what are you on about do you think to test me gwa ha ha ha ha ha youre a daft lot i respect your courage but youve chosen the wrong foe if you cant judge your enemys skill youll wind up fish food youll do well to remember that if youre lucky enough to live
uugwoh  cant believe  you beat  me  youve lost  your way  to the dread isle  for good 
whats this are you spent already hm attacking someone youre asking a favor of insolent louts i thought you smarter than that you disappointed me go on away with you theres no ship thatll carry such conceited half wits as you never show your faces here again
what mooncalves i wouldve let em sit there if they hadnt come any closer up and at em mates attack
are you interested in this sword here its called a lancereaver its an incredible sword to take against lances still it is a little weak against axes go ahead take it youre going to the dread isle right if you want to avoid the pirates go behind the shop from there just head straight down the alley good luck to you
youre a brave soul to come to such a perilous place here you should have this staff you can use it to make those whose magical resistances are weaker than your own fall asleep for a while whether it works or not depends on the skill of the wielder ho yes looks like those pirates are bearing down on you maybe this staff will help you get away
this road leads to danger the pirates are waiting for you do you not think it would be better to find another route youve risked much to come here i cant let you leave empty handed take this axe what do you think nice isnt it however its cursed its a mighty weapon but if one with bad luck wields it  ooooh terrible terrible i tell you dont use it unless you have to
youre being tested by pirates with passage to the dread isle hanging in the balance here use this bow its a rare beauty eh a sacaen friend gave it to me but i cant use it dont get yourself killed out there ok
have you been to the arena yet its filled with toughs and bravados you can get rich there  all you have to do is wager and win if youre beaten however you lose both money and life if you think youre going to lose press the b button to give up remember you cant give up if youre dead so dont wait too long
aha you made it whelps
that was  hard 
haa haa youll give us passage now wont you
im a man of the sea i always keep my wordare my old eyes lyin to me is this beauty really with you gwaa ha ha ha my lucky day
 
listen i know how you feel but you have to accept it weve no other choice
i know that i havent said a word have i
we can go to the dread isle now please father  be well

 his life is yet his own
ah father sky and mother earth i thank you for your mercy
leila what are you doing here
i  im following lord uthers orders im investigating marquess pheraes disappearance
my father what have you learned
come with me we should talk in private
  
huh come on eliwood
ah 
worrying about things wont change them
i know im fine lets go
let me start with my conclusion
  
marquess pherae  is alive
whooooo eliwood
thats wonderful
are you sure
ive been posing as a member of the black fang for several months thats where i got this information i believe it is true
black fang  theyre the assassins guild that erik spoke of
yes weve known of their existence for quite some time
explain
the black fang is a guild of assassins founded about ten years ago by brendan reed theyre based in bern their arms reached quickly in several other countries originally they targeted only nobles who abused their positions the masses saw them as chivalrous defenders of the common man their activities found wide support
chivalrous 
then about a year ago brendan got married again black fangs operations have slowly changed since then now theyll take on any target no matter how difficult as long as theyre paid and theyre no longer killing only criminals anyone is a fair target
is this black fang responsible for whats happened to my grandfather
yes weve learned of a mystery man named nergal behind reeds wife it seems the black fang is performing secret tasks across lycia for nergal nergals trusted retainer ephidel is with marquess laus he manipulated laus into hatching the rebellion plot against ostia the first to answer lauss call for rebellion was  marquess santaruz
lord helman  why would you 
  
next was lord elbert marquess pherae
youre telling me that my father endorsed this plan
i cannot say i do know that he is with marquess laus currently in a place called  the dragons gate
dragons gate where is that
on an isle called valor off the southern coast of lycia i apologize but that is all the information i have
of all places to be valor  blast
what kind of place is it
its said that those who step onto the island never return the common folk call it the dread isle if thats where my father is however  i will go and find him  and this “dragons gate” too
im going with you ill tell you right now you cant stop me
im also going
lyndis i appreciate your kindness but  shouldnt you stay with marquess caelin
laus must be stopped otherwise they might target my grandfather again i also wish to help eliwoods father losing a parent  its an unbearable pain its something id rather you didnt have to feel yet
lyndis  hector  thank you you give me strength
dont mention it
were friends its what friends do eliwood
im also going to continue searching lady lyndis i think it would be prudent to let the world think marquess caelin is dead
i understand ill do that thank you
no thanks necessary if youll excuse me
leila
yes
nergal and this ephidel what are they like
ive yet to lay eyes on nergal ive spoken to ephidel on several occasions however hes eerie he always wears a cloak that covers his face and yet 
what is it
his eyes glow golden  you cant miss them they seem inhuman
  
is that you leila
matthew its been a long time
what have you been doing more dangerous work
were spies matthew everything we do is dangerous
thats true so how long do you think this missions going to last
my objective is the same as yours to rescue marquess pherae if things go well ill be in ostia at the same time as you are
is that so you need to visit my hometown
is this where you were born why
 to meet my parents
hm matthew 
ha ha well thats that see you
as slippery as ever  didnt even wait for my reply
lady lyndis
everyone  im happy to see you all well im going after marquess laus protect my grandfather
one moment lady lyndis please take this jewel before you leave
jewel
we were able to move it before lauss men ransacked our vaults
we will take care of lord hausen please lady lyndis return to us safely
i will thank you

the greatest military force on the continent the lycian league has always enjoyed close relations with the kingdom of bern recently however king desmond has begun to flaunt his military strength lycian nobles can no longer move freely within berns borders eliwood and his group enter the country in the guise of simple travelers
the greatest military force on the continent the lycian league has always enjoyed close relations with the kingdom of bern recently however king desmond has begun to flaunt his military strength lycian nobles can no longer move freely within berns borders hector and his group enter the country in the guise of simple travelers
were in bern now i wonder whats happened the village seems so busy
i spoke to some villagers on the way here they said prince zephiels coming of age ceremony is in ten days theres no helping all the excitement
theyve no idea whats happening carefree fools
  tell me hawkeye do you know the location of the shrine of seals
ive heard its north of bern but the location of the shrine itself is secret i doubt if anyone outside the royal family knows how to reach it
so if we want to reach the shrine well have to contact the royal family is that it
without revealing our identities or our motives theres got to be another way to find where it is
 i can provide you with its general location
lord pent
im privy to the highest secrets of military information in etruria when we learned of the shrines existence we investigated however none of our operatives returned berns defenses are formidable
so even if we reach the shrine were as like as not to be captured
most likely and if your identities are discovered bern will see it as an excuse to invade lycia
that above all else must be avoided
thats where i come in
what do you mean
duty demands that i attend the post ceremony festivities however i will greet the queen privately before the ceremony
privately you can do that
queen hellene was born in etruria she and i are related albeit a distant relation
when we meet i will discreetly ask about the shrine of seals most like shell not say much but anything will help will it not rest assured even if i fail i will not reveal your presence
lord pent thats  
if we do not return by tomorrow return to lycia and come up with a new plan understood
 if you fail what will become of you
everything will work out it wouldnt be a bad life abandoning my position  living on the run with louise 
if im with you my lord pent i care not where we go
i pray for your success
please do let us proceed louise
come back safely well be waiting for you
 pent hold on
what is it hawkeye
i was holding this for the master
its a  heaven seal
mm there are only three in existence
what is archsage athoss plan
im to give it to them when the time is right
 i see
i  i might not know the right time when it comes i want you to take care of it
thank you but what if we do not return
you will you and louise    without fail
 i understand
lord hawkeye we  we will most certainly return
well if it isnt nino
yeah lloyd linus what is it are you working
i suppose we are
how about you where are you off to in such a hurry
i have a job to do too im carrying messages for mother so i have to do my best see you lets do something when your job is finished
shes a good lass
yes hard to believe shes that womans child
this waiting is hard there must be something we can do
i know what you mean but we have to lay low 
why dont we try and gather some information on the black fang
hm information
yes black fangs headquarters are here in bern the location was never disclosed to me though the black fang is so much different than it once was any information we could gain would be beneficial
thats a good idea thanks legault
think nothing of it
what do you think tactician  youre right any information we find would be a starting place then its settled lets get started
lets split up and go try to blend in
wed better be careful
especially you hector
what
those two  i cant tell if theyre friends or not
tee hee 
is something funny ninian
its just  listen to you grumble lord eliwood you sound like youre their chaperon
really is that what it sounds like to you
uh huh
thats great 
ha ha ha
 i like it when you laugh
excuse me
oh nothing come on lets go
 can it really be them i thought they were in nabata
what does it matter where theyve been we found them so lets take care of them
i guess youre right  yet the timings not right attacking them while theyre in town is against our creed  shall we tell father and await his orders
linus ill go and tell father you stay here and watch them
why dont you and i finish them now
we cant you have to be patient all you need to do is watch where they go understand
uh huh
  even so i cant ignore game when its nibbling on my line hey igor
what is it linus
were going hunting well taunt them and pull them to the center of the town
hold on a minute youre not really going to ignore lloyds orders are you
 he doesnt want the villagers harmed thats what he said right so we make sure theyre not
i understand but 
come on igor we want to show my brother we can do this right im counting on you
 grrr you just never ever listen to anyone
you are eliwood
who  ah youre black fang
thats right you have the honor of dying at the hands of the four fangs our commander is linus the mad dog
eliwood is that the enemy
yes lets meet his challenge
 come youll get your throats ripped out 
bern   hm oh mark i have few fond memories of my homeland im a deserter yet i cant say im not a little glad to be here i hope that someday soon i can clear my name and return home
   who oh its you is it mark you caught me unawares and looking stupid its just that i am a former black fang member and i was a bit wrapped up in some silly emotions nothing for you to worry about direct me as you will
lets see  im sure this is the place but  i guess hes not here yet     hmm beautiful weather its perfect for taking on evildoers yet here i am again running errands  i wish i were more worthy so that i could help out in battle
waah dont  dont scare me like that jaffar whats wrong youre never late for anything
 my last job took longer than expected
what there are things that can slow you down i would never have expected that
 if youve my next mission let me hear it
oh right mother gave this to me  huh oh wha what happened youre covered in blood
 its a scratch pay it no heed 
scratches dont bleed like that let me see
forget it next target hurry    
jaffar come on wake  wake up what should i do
er  is there something i can help you with i have an injured man here please keep your voice down no i dont know anything about the black fang leave please youll upset my patient
tell me traveler have you heard of the four fangs the folk of bern know all about them theyre the four strongest members of the righteous black fang the one they call the mad dog is a great man when i was being attacked by bandits he rescued me it was night so i really couldnt see his face but  ive heard some troubling rumors about the black fang lately though i wonder whats going on
long ago the lord who ruled this area was an awful man every night he would hold an extravagant feast below the castle meanwhile we villagers slowly starved to death one day though it ended the lord was dead the black fang had given him a death sentence to us the black fang were heroes it matters not what others said thats what makes it so hard  why did they have to change helping you means that im betraying the black fang and yet i want you to have this
 stop right there
who
no need for alarm for reasons of my own i wear the garb of the black fang but im a loyal citizen of lycia and i am not your enemy
  
a woman now leads the black fang around by the nose when at last you confront her use this staff this woman is the ringleader you seek her name is sonia do not forget sonia
long ago i used to work in berns royal palace i was prince zephiels teacher of history the prince is a wise lad hes the royal familys first prodigy yet king desmond ignores the boys talents and they wither here id like you to take this this is an earth seal this one item contains the powers of many knight crest guide ring hero crest elysian whip  i am unsure why i would entrust this treasure to a complete stranger i cannot explain it but i have a feeling for some reason i believe you will aid the prince  strange  go on humor an old man and take it
i will repeat it as often as necessary lord murdock if we let the kings tyranny continue bern will  
hold your tongue
but  
be still
wait a minute ive seen you before
what do you think you can just come up and start  
ah i know youre that guy who worked for belger geitz
dart is that you what are you doing here
i like to raise some trouble on land every now and then how about you what are you doing working for your father
dont mention the old man as far as im concerned im no part of that family anymore
well then what are you doing here
nothing  i was wandering about when this battle erupted  say dart do you think i could join up with you
huh of all the stupid 
youre raising trouble right so let me in on the action
its fine with me were up against a pretty touch bunch though
ive nothing else to do ill fight til i get bored
lets go then
yeah
pray ill give you that much time all the evil youve done up to now  repent it and sleep
hey youre eliwood right
 are you the leader of this group
i am
ive a question for you  i heard that the black fang possessed strong convictions if so then why do you follow a man like nergal
 nergal oh that eerie man sonia introduced my father to this has nothing to do with him i merely complete the missions given me
and you never question the justness of your missions
question whats to question neither my father nor my brother makes mistakes
yet the 
will you stop yammering i dont need my brother to finish you off i will crush you myself in the name of the fang
ah
hey you the leader of this pack of curs
i am linus reed son of brendan reed head of the black fang evildoers prepare to receive the fangs justice
evildoers youve no room to speak youre a bunch of murderers serving nergals every whim
are you so base that you bandy insults with your foe or are you frightened knowing you face your doom we are the black fang you do not insult my family so
 are you well
  i lost my brother tried to warn me  youre strong  too strong
  
but  i will not die quite so easily
what
youll go with me
eliwood
 do as you must
huh  what did you 
 i noticed something during the battle you did your best to keep the villagers clear of the fighting
of course theyve nothing to do with this you are our target not them
you are not evil the black fang fights with honor so why is it that we are enemies
its your fault youre evil    bah
huh
none of this makes sense sonia told father that youre a band of criminals father agreed and i obeyed but 
sonia isnt that 
 im going to withdraw for the moment ill be back when this is all straightened out
that was close
forgive me i wanted to speak with him at least once
dont worry its fine after all we learned a little something about our opponent
the black fang seems to have some honor after all perhaps they really are just being used by nergal we should talk to their leader brendan reed
perhaps we can resolve this without any more fighting
i dont like it sounds like a terrible plan
hector
lets get back to camp we might have some word from pent and the others
i wonder what that was all about
 
 ive got to talk with my brother   im not sure its wise to trust that woman  
 uhh how 
  
you i never felt you    nothing  
 mad dog linus such wonderful quintessence
  curse s   ive blu blundered  brother im sorry     
  
are you awake thank goodness 
you  i know you 
uh huh weve met many times i dont think i told you my name though im nino sonias daughter
what are you doing
huh
have you forgotten the law of the fang sacrifice the wounded to salvage the strong
thats not 
i was unconscious and alone outside of our safe halls you should have obeyed the law  killed me and then fled yet you didnt why
bu but  letting a comrade die i couldnt do that
dont be a fool
sniff 
 tsk 
dont move here lean on me
 dont touch 
please dont move so much blood  youre bleeding again what do i do it wont stop
  
please dont die you mustnt die
   linus  you fool after all i told you      wait for me ill be joining you soon enough and ill bring you their corpses as a gift
your royal highness his majesty the king has arrived
wheres zephiel
your majesty  tis a pleasure to see you what a glorious day that sees you grace us with your presence
 enough call the boy
your son is practicing his falconry
you knew i was coming and yet you sent him away hmph  as crafty as ever woman very well you will have to do its ten days until the boys coming of age ceremony i would speak of it
at last  once the ceremony ends our son so long lingering in the shadows will be received by all as the legitimate heir to your throne do you know how he has longed for this day
cease your complaints you and zephiel queen and heir of bern have never wanted for anything
we are here in this manse while you live in the palace with  that woman you must be so disappointed that she bore you not a prince but a princess
hellene you go too far
my child who through me carries the noble blood of etruria in his veins will in ten days be named as the right born heir to the throne ha ha ha no matter how you may dote on her your illegitimate daughter guinivere is destined to be nothing more than a baseborn shadow  it is my son who shall reign in bern my son zephiel ha ha ha ha ha how it gives me such pleasure to say those words
have you said your mind well i have something for you to hear as well
what could it be
last night from the palace the fire emblem was stolen away by some villain
it cant be  ha ha ha you are so wicked your majesty pray tell who would believe such a tale the fire emblem is berns greatest national treasure no gem in existence is its equal stealing such a heavily guarded object is impossible is it not
unfortunately i speak true
no 
you know of the importance of the fire emblem its the symbol of the heir the heart of the ceremony without the emblem the ceremony must be canceled
no thi this was your doing wasnt it how can you despise zephiel so he is of your blood he is your beloved son is he not
i have heard that zephiel is  a gifted student a stunning fighter excelling in all he tries and ive also heard that he is much loved by the people
yes it is true all of it he is a worthy son
i excelled at neither books nor blades
what do you  
i cannot say that i command the love of my subjects  zephiel and i are opposites in every way it is hard to believe that he is my son
zephiel is your majestys child your grace you know this is truth
mine or not without the ceremony  he will not be named heir mark my words and prepare yourself woman
your majesty king desmond please  please wait he is your heir your son please  what am i to do zephiel 
i beg your pardon your hgihness you have a visitor 
i will see no one send him home
your highness i 
its all right you may go i will take care of this

louise is it truly you ah  louise 
what is it your eyes are so red its a shame to see such beauty marred by tears
there is something  i 
if it please you i would hear your troubles my husband is here with me perhaps he will be able to lend you his aid
lord pent is also here i see      to be honest 
lord pent lady louise
sorry to have kept you waiting
 how did everything go
 i cant say it was a complete failure yet 
what do you mean
weve a task to perform
what do you mean
queen hellene is looking for something if we find it for her 
she will listen to our request is that it
we have until the morning of the tenth day from today  what will you do the decision is yours
 well do it it is most certainly a test we were destined to take
 can it really be them i thought they were in nabata
what does it matter where theyve been we found them so lets take care of them
i guess youre right  linus go tell father whats happening
why theyre right in front of us you and i could finish this now
moron its a precaution the fangs cannot afford mistakes dont worry i have underlings aplenty ill taunt the foe and draw them to the fortress in the north i doubt ill lose but  theyve survived this long so they must be tough i might run into trouble deliver your report then get back here with reinforcements
you cant be serious they dont look like they can last long against you the white wolf
just get moving linus
 understood ill be back soon though so leave some for me
you must eliwood 
ah black fang
thats right you have the honor of dying at the hands of the four fangs our commander is lloyd the white wolf
eliwood is that the enemy
counterattack to arms everyone
 come youll get your throats ripped out 
grrrr not again this is the 75th time i could have sworn caelin was in this direction grrr  eh somethings wrong  is it a sneak attack you cowards waiting in the fog my name is wallace the boldest knight in all caelin wherever it is if youre not afraid to die show yourselves bwah ha ha ha ha ha ha
in the name of the fang i sentence you to death do not blame me for your fate it is your own doing
 are you the leader of this group
yes
i heard that the black fang possessed strong convictions if so then why do you follow a man like nergal
this has nothing to do with nergal or sonia we simply complete the missions given us
and you never question the justness of your missions
who are we to pass judgment on the commands given us we are the jaw that bites we act without question
but 
granted you dont seem like a bad sort however the fangs judgment cannot be undone it is time for you to die
ah
 and you would be the leader of this pack of curs
aye that i am
ive no mercy for nergals hounds of the hunt stand and prepare to be beaten
you  you wish to challenge me with that axe of yours  youre amusing ill grant you that im sure youd have linus laughing if he were here be warned you would do well not to take me lightly
 are you well
  im beaten you are strong stronger than id realized
  
youre foolish as well to waste sentiment on me your enemy 
ah
this is what happens
eliwood
 
peace ive no plans on fleeing with a hostage after i deal with you ill let the rest of them go
uhai said the same thing
what
we battled your comrade uhai on the dread isle  he told us hed do nothing so cowardly as take a hostage he fought with honor you black fang are not evil by nature so why is it that we fight
uhai  you spoke with him
yes with his dying breath he told us the way to the dragons gate

that was close
forgive me i wanted to speak with him at least once
dont worry its fine after all we learned a little something about our opponent
the black fang seems to have some honor after all perhaps they really are just being used by nergal we should talk to their leader brendan reed
perhaps we can resolve this without any more fighting
i dont like it sounds like a terrible plan
hector
lets get back to camp we might have some word from pent and the others
i wonder what that was all about

hector and his companions defeat marquess lauss son erik and seize castle laus after the battle they rest in the castle and settle their affairs they diligently prepare for a possible counterattack they shouldve spotted anyone attempting to approach the castle and yet somehow they find themselves facing an unforeseen attack 
lord hector were under attack
is it marquess laus hes come back to take the castle perfect well catch him easily
no its not him  the attackers arent regular army maybe theyre mercenaries hired by laus 
mercenaries
their movements are very rapid  coordinated theyve already made their way into the castle
for mercenaries theyre very very good eliwood do you have any ideas
my father told me something once  theres a mercenary group extremely loyal to house laus their leader is named eubans but hes called the hurricane hes famed for surprise attacks and lightning swift strikes
hmmm  this could be interesting protect the throne we will not lose this castle
sealen
is that you heath
ive secured a retreat path as commander eubans ordered just in case something goes wrong 
i dont need you to tell me when to retreat if we lose the element of surprise we fall back
ive heard there are ostian knights among the enemy forces watch yourself sealen
are we friends now worrying so about a complete stranger  heath you werent meant to be a mercenary
our goal is the throne well attack from the front and send another unit behind we want to drive the enemy into a state of chaos the ambush units are concealed as ordered when the enemy splits its forces we strike thats all go
ill meet any challengers here someone else go after the throne
so this is a mercenarys death 
yes we survived
the rest of the enemy units have begun to retreat it must be part of their plan half of them are already gone
blast you have to admire their efficiency though eubanss mercenaries  i wont forget this well likely cross paths again someday and theres the assassins i fought in ostia 
hector is something wrong
no nothing special we simply have to tighten our belts and prepare it appears we have more than one enemy oswin
well see to the castle defenses at once 
no i grow weary of defending things lets get out of here and pursue marquess laus its time to put him on the defense
/***EOF***/
passing through araphen and khathelet lyn and her friends arrive at in caelin however caelin is now under the rule of lord lundgren lundgrens henchmen lay in wait to assassinate lyn they wait for her approach and ready a special weapon
look mark the mountains seem so far away now weve come such a long way 
milady lyndis mark we cant be far from the castle now
by my reckoning we can reach castle caelin in two days if we hurry
two more days  hold on grandfather please 
cheer up lyn if they see you looking so sad the entire company will lose heart
florina  youre right theres nothing to be gained by worrying we just have to press onward
thats the spirit
lyn  danger approaches 
what did you say
i dont see anything are you sure
i feel it too im sure of it ah milady dont move
hm
what in  where did this bolt come from
they have a ballista
lord lundgren is getting serious deploying siege engines is no mean feat
what is a ballista
its a weapon designed for long distance attacks only archers can use them but they can be devastating
florina you must stay aground do not take to the air the ballista would target you in an instant
is there a way to combat it
the safest course is to use someone with good defense as bait so the enemy wastes arrows
then you can walk up and knock the fool on the head
wil can you use a ballista
ive never tried but  its just a really big bow right i should be able to figure it out
all we can ask is that you try  lets see what we can do
ah lady lyndis mark i have some minor  business  to attend to im unable to join you if you need any of my possessions please take them now
on the far side of the hill to the south is a ballista as kent said its a weapon intended for trained archers the attack range of ballistae is extremely large so they can fire on enemies at great distances as they can attack without fear of counterattack theyre quite useful to use one move an archer onto an unoccupied ballista and select the ride command after that you can attack as usual ballistae can also be moved while in use additionally ballistae can be used by any archer in the field so if you can remove the enemy manning the ballista and move one of your group onto it  youll find it most useful
what are you curs waiting for theyre nothing but fleas call up for reinforcements and rush em
do you remember the weapon triangle axes over lances and whatnot this is important so pay attention there are some weapons that dont follow the normal rules this here lancereaver is one of those its a sword that reverses the triangle so if you wield this blade you can best a lance with it of course theres a downside  axes can best this sword take this as a gift its your reward for listening to an old man ramble dont be so shy its not like i can use the thing not everyone can wield a sword of this caliber im sure you know someone who can use it though
curses the ballista must have been taken  whats going on here somebody get that girl
lord lundgren  ive failed you  i pray you hurry with those reinforcements you promised
is it over
yes i see no more enemy soldiers however something is bothering me
what is it
i noticed it during the fighting our opponents  they were soldiers of caelin i even recognized some of those we fought i trained with many of them  amd yet they attacked us without hesitation
theyre black hearted traitors whove joined lord lundgren good riddance i say it also means less resistance at the castle
i hope youre right 
im just glad nils and ninian were with us if that first shot had hit me i might not have survived
we are honored to have served you well
we wont let you down
i know im relying on you
whats this you dealt with the ballista too nicely done
matthew where were you during all this
i went to the village to sniff about for information i got some interesting news for my trouble too
lets hear it
first about marquess caelins illness he really is unwell hes been abed for nigh on three months
oh no  grandfather 
i heard an interesting rumor about his condition though the people believe that someones been poisoning the marquess 
hes being poisoned
and this someone  well everyones too afraid to mention a name however they say that as soon as the marquess took ill a certain noble took control of the castle as though it were his own i fed a hungry inkeeper some coin and he fed me a name the marquess of caelins own brother lord lundgren
how can this be how can they allow him to get away with this the villagers know hes the one poisoning my grandfather and yet no one raises a hand against him why
they are afraid and they lack proof the whisperings of the common people means nothing
thats the truth of it and of the marquesss loyal retainers who might have lent credence to these rumors there is no sign
are you saying theyve been silenced
its a fair assumption
this is beyond believing
the worst news is yet to come
what theres more
an imposters appeared claiming to be the marquesss granddaughter at least thats the story lundgrens telling to all wholl listen
what does that mean
it means that people are waiting for two traitorous knights and a baseborn child to appear and lay claim to castle caelin
but  but that  it cant be
traitors us ridiculous
he says  im an imposter
dont you have anything that proves your lineage
when my mother joined the lorca she brought nothing of lycia with her
milady marquess araphen himself remarked at your resemblance to lady madelyn your face is your proof
theyll say we found a look alike somewhere  were seen as betrayers of our knightly vows our word means nothing no our only hope is to see marquess caelin himself
we must hurry if not my grandfather  i must see him with my last breath if need be
but we must formulate some manner of plan even if we set out for the castle the troops patrolling the area will cause no end of problems you have been branded as oathbreakers after all
ive got it eliwood  he seemed sympathetic to our plight he should still be in khathelet if we can talk to him he might help us
of course a sound idea
lets hurry
yes back to khathelet
/***EOF***/
after speaking with the village magistrate eliwood and company set their sights on laus the road from pherae to laus passes through santaruz eliwood suspects his missing father must have visited santaruz en route to ostia eliwood arranges a meeting with the local ruling lord to see what he can learn
hector leaves ostia he moves towards santaruz to meet up with eliwood as quickly as possible he encounters a mysterious group whose dark garb hide an even darker secret perhaps these same powers have turned their blades on eliwood hector hurries south praying for his friends safety
what eliwood is here
yes he has set camp up on a hill south of here he seeks permission to enter santaruz he seeks an audience with you
could it be  do you think eliwoods come to ask of his father if thats the case  i  i know not what to tell him
tell him you know nothing and let him be on his way
yet  i know young eliwood well his father elbert and i are old friends ive no children of my own and ive always treasured eliwood  i do not believe i could look him in the eye and  i could not lie to him i could not
weve no choice then let us chase the boy away if you do not speak with him you need tell no lies
wait do you mean to harm eliwood
not harm frighten a scratch or two will leave no scars he will run home to pherae and be done with his adventure he is after all all that pherae has left 
 
instead of entering laus with such a small group we should meet with marquess santaruz and request his assistance  i see the sense in that its a good plan mark
truly so i tell you again im pleased to have you with us lord helman  hes not only my fathers friend ive known him since i was a child im sure that he will help us
what lord eliwood beware
heh heh heh  noble sirs alms for a poor villager
poor villager you look nothing like an honest man clear the road step quickly or 
step quickly heh heh  good advice maybe its you who should follow it
what
someone wants the boy in an early grave a shame if you ask me but hell die here today cmon boys earn your keep
here we go again eh mark just like old times  seems our fates are bound natalie oh shes still in pherae im working for you this time so shes not too worried guide my axe mark
lord hector i have it i know where lord eliwood is he entered santaruz not far from here
is that so weve read his movements fairly well then lets move due south and cross the border well meet up with him in santaruz
ah there you are lord hector
oh no 
serra w what  what are you doing here
youre going to meet lord eliwood right well i want to go too
go home this is no game
but oswin told me it was all right to come
oswin
yes my lord on the marquesss orders serra and i will be accompanying you
bah this is ridiculous always have to have the last word eh brother
no matter what you think hes just worried about you lord hector youre the only family he has
i know 
lord hector up ahead there appears to be fighting
where is it eliwood come lets get closer hurry oswin matthew
yes my lord
oh wait for me im coming too
hey whats going on over there looks like some rough business you soldier are you just going to stand there and watch
who do you think you are this is santaruz what occurs here is no affair of any foreign lordling
i believe im going to have to disagree with you you see the man theyre attacking happens to be a friend of mine
a friend what  urrrgh
sorry but im in a hurry
ewww thats terrible i loathe violence
nicely done my lord youre a fighter born
i cannot condone resorting to force so quickly 
chastise me later oswin first we deal with these brigands come we must help eliwood
help eliwood sounds like a convenient excuse for more violence
oswin
yes yes im coming
matthew bring serra and follow along
what with serra
no i want to go with you now
absolutely not youll slow us down zzz
oh how rude
oswin lets go
bah he puts up a good fight for a pampered noble pup its up to me to finish him
how many are there this looks–
hey whats going on over there looks like some rough business you soldier are you just going to stand there and watch
who do you think you are this is santaruz what occurs here is no affair of any foreign lordling
i believe im going to have to disagree with you you see the man theyre attacking happens to be a friend of mine
a friend what  urrrgh
sorry but im in a hurry
ewww thats terrible i loathe violence
nicely done my lord youre a fighter born
i cannot condone resorting to force so quickly 
chastise me later oswin first we deal with these brigands come we must help eliwood
help eliwood sounds like a convenient excuse for more violence
oswin
yes yes im coming
matthew take serra and find someplace to hide
what with serra
no im going with you
you are not youll slow us down
oh how rude
oswin lets go
hmm  you look like youve some experience with battle no need to conceal it ive fought in many a battle in my time i assure you let me tell you one thing about combat though the most important thing is technique if youve no skill youll rarely strike your enemy my instructor gave me this secret book long ago it will improve the fighting prowess of the one who reads it im too old to make use of it so why dont you take it
its really important to trust your companions yes if you have a boon companion fighting at your side you feel stronger and more confident hm who do i think make good companions for whom well i am a fortune teller so i could do a reading but 
i saw them i did about a month ago marquess pherae and his men passed right through here theyve all gone missing havent they a group as strong as that just up and vanishing couldnt have been bandits but i dont believe it mustve been something terrible the worlds become a dangerous place it has
the marquess who leads santaruz is lord helman he doesnt ask for much and hes a nice enough fellow i wouldnt call him weak but he is more follower than leader lately hes been meeting with marquess laus quite a lot i hope nothing bad comes of it but 
eliwood are you all right
hector what are you–
later first lets take care of these louts
right
curses what are you waiting for let me show you boys how its done
oh aaurr this was not so easy as it seemed 
whew is that all of them
hector where did you come from
well met eliwood
yes but what are you doing here
you wound me
how do you mean
youre looking for your father right why didnt you send word
your brother was just named marquess ostia hes going to be very busy setting up his court council lord uther must need your support you are his brother after all
my brother is not so weak oh he has mentioned some things in public but he knew exactly what i was planning and he let me go
is that so well then it would be unwise to refuse his kindness it does me good to see you hector thank you
think nothing of it you know oswin dont you
well met lord eliwood
it is good to see you again oswin so you came as well
yes lord uther was worried about lord hector traveling alone ive been ordered to keep a close eye on him
ha ha ha of course good to have you with us
lord hector why didnt you tell me the fighting was done
i apologize for the interruption i couldnt restrain her any longer
are these your companions hector
oh yes i suppose they are one might have hoped for better but 
that was uncalled for i cant believe you said that matthew did you hear what he said about you
me he was talking about you
hector why dont you introduce us
the noisy one is serra believe it or not shes a cleric
yes i am serra my lord pleased to meet you
and thats matthew he does a lot of sneaking around
my lord
sneaking around
well i er gather information open doors chests and such ive got nimble fingers
that sounds like a thiefs work 
well dont let it worry you
but 
this journey i suspect it will be harder than you imagine you may have to accept things like this if you want to survive
what is it hector do you know something
nothing specific rumors abound though a league of assassins from bern has been moving around in lycia experienced bounty hunters and mercenaries are vanishing 
that reminds me one of the men who attacked us said something odd
what was it
lord eliwood if i may
marcus good to see you
lord hector its been far too long your assistance is greatly appreciated
come now marcus no need for such formalities tell me what you heard
of course the apparent leader of that gang of thugs he indicated that someone was watching lord eliwood that someone needed him dead
hmm that is troubling actually a captain of the guard was watching the fight when we arrived he was a knight of santaruz and yet he just stood there and let a lord be attacked i think he was planning on seeing you die
so mark what do you think  you might be right something may have happened to lord helman too come we must hurry to the castle
eliwood who is this
this is mark i required tactical aid in the search for my father and 
oh i see so this is who directed the battle plan back there hm you know mark youre very young weve many strategists in ostia but none so young eliwood are you sure about this one
mark is still a student of military strategy but weve received nothing but sound advice so far mark has my trust
all right i suppose i shall witness your skills firsthand well met mark
hello how have you been mark eh my secrets revealed oh that yes its true my guise as a common thief was but a ruse ive served house ostia for some time as a spy of sorts surprised well regardless it looks like well be traveling together again heres to our mutual survival
eeeeeeee mark is it really you its been far far too long you missed me didnt you of course you did i knew it hm didnt i tell you before im in the employ of ostia lycias ruling territory ill be here to help you just like before arent you lucky
/***EOF***/
after receiving aid from queen hellene eliwoodhector rushes to the sealed shrine the secret road they follow is known only to the royal family  they pass berns soldiers unnoticed and unhindered they approach the castle

unexpected shouldnt be as soon as that skulking shadow nergal showed up i knew the fang was as good as finished

do you regret the outcome of your actions
 graybeard he only wanted to avenge his brother i cant   maybe its regret  ill carry it with me forever when im alone and dying what will i be thinking of
youre a powerful man i doubt such power will let you live a life of peace yet you should not fear for perhaps that is the path of your life
 the path of my life 
lord athos when did you arrive
just now  i warped in you know i was watching you in my scrying crystal the most important thing is that youve made it here
if thats true why didnt you just magic us here in the first place
what would that have proven you cannot hope to succeed if you cannot trust your own strength your own power must drive you that is the most important thing now then shall we go underground  where bramimond awaits
bramimond one of the eight legends is that who youre talking about
thats right of the eight legends only bramimond and myself remain your journey here was a bit of a test im afraid i had to see if you were worthy of wielding a legendary item
legendary item
thats right its a weapon that we the eight legends used to defeat the dragons with it you will be able to sever nergals power at its roots
a weapon to defeat nergal 
the legendary items are sealed in lands across this continent the only one capable of removing those seals is bramimond now if only we will be granted this one request
its so dark 
its creepy  cant see a thing
shh  someones here
youre bramimond 
 yes i suppose that is me what do you want of me you who live above ground
we have a favor to ask we seek something to help us defeat nergal 
that is unfortunate for i cannot grant that which you seek humanity would suffer were i to remove the seals
what do you mean the entire world is on the brink of destruction as it is
the entire world why would i care about that the whole world can burn for all i care
by father sky  your voice  the way you talk it keeps changing how many 
bramimond has no self he  she  it  yes it is a mirror that reflects the person addressing it it projects no personality of its own there are as many bramimonds as there are people facing him  bramimond do you remember me
 athos hmm its been many ages i cannot fathom why you brought these people here why i sealed everything away  do you forget why the legendary items are not meant for human hands
but we cant stop nergal like this we need your power to help us save the world
  
bramimond remember  we too are human these people they will not be seduced by power they came here without my aid using their own abilities you observed them did you not
 its true  they seem better stronger than most humans and yet humans are frail what guarantee do i have  that they will not succumb to that frailty athos
a guarantee there is none we simply ask that you believe in us
    once  there was a man much like you his gaze never wandered it was ever fixed straight ahead        
 the seals have been released you may now do as you please im tired you will let me rest
ah its good to breathe the outside air again
bramimond is certainly a mysterious figure
mm  i wonder what convinced him to release the seals
interesting that  i believe it was darkness a completely impenetrable darkness the nature of which is beyond the comprehension of normal men regardless you must hurry the seals have been broken nergal has surely sensed this already  you must get to the blazing blade as soon as possible 
how unfortunate  youre too late
ah
nergal
at last  at last my power is restored come ninian nils this way open the dragons gate for me
 n no
  
you mustnt go neither of you
would you like to see my powers here and now you may choose ninian obey me or 
 if i go with you will you let my brother go
ninian
one of you should prove sufficient   as you wish
no ninian why
 look after lord eliwood 
ninian
ninian you must not
  
the gate will open and i will gain unlimited power
niniaaaaaaaan
dont move nergal
no get down both of you
are you awake eliwood
where 
camp you and nils were both knocked unconscious by nergals parting gift do you remember
his power  its so much more than before
if lord athos hadnt erected a barrier when he did  we would have lost both you and nils  
if hed truly wished to kill you even my power could not have saved you
ninian  to protect us she 
even if you catch him you cant defeat him not as you are if you wish to save the girl ninian  the power to topple nergal lies within the sacred weapon do you understand eliwood
 yes i know what i must do
you must go to ostia and take possession of rolands blade but before you go  take this eliwood
this is  its a 
thats right its a heaven seal
im sorry lord athos these seals  they do not find me worthy
trust me take it and hold it in your hands
very well      its  
lord athos
hm as i thought it finds you suitable
 this is incredible my body is overflowing with power
way to go eliwood
lets go we have to get that weapon we will defeat nergal and rescue ninian
to find the legendary item you must travel westward but before that  hector this is for you
huh this is 
thats right its a heaven seal
listen graybeard  i tried one of these earlier and  well nothing happened ok
trust me take it and hold it in your hands
no i  oh all right         whats happening 
whats going on  incredible
hm as i thought it finds you suitable
it feels like theres a beast running wild through me   whats  whats going to happen to me
for a short while the newly awakened power will run rampant yet this power is your right by birth youll be able to harness it and use it shortly
 power running rampant  through my body 
hector are you all right your arms are trembling 
its true  i feel like i can overcome anything nothing can stop me come on eliwood lets go get that weapon and tear that nergal to pieces
regarding this particular issue please convey to lord uther that consent has been given
yes sir
lord uther your judgment  its too      
oswin where are you
 
oswin there you are you just received a message from ostia didnt you what word from my brother
nothing of any import  a simple relaying of recent events is all
oswin what is it whats happened ive never seen you look like this before
is that so i must be more tired than i thought
if thats all  get some rest will you
yes i thank you for your concern  by the way did you finish speaking with lord athos
yeah were really moving toward something spectacular
spectacular
there are legendary items buried throughout the world but we dont have time to gather each one weve settled on collecting a sword and an axe the sword is for eliwood or lyn i think the axe is to be mine
the legendary axe  the berserker durbans thunder axe armads
impressive oswin youre so knowledgeable to get this armads im going west with old graybeard athos
just the two of you
yeah at first then i have to pass some sort of trial bramimond had to break the seal protecting the weapon but now if im to gain it i have to pass a negotiation of strength or something
 i see the weapons an axe so you have to prove your strength
 i will get it thats the only way we can defeat nergal
i believe in you i pray for your swift return
  oswin im going to ask one last time look me in the eye when you answer my brother  theres nothing you need to tell me is there
  nothing the message  it said that there was nothing new with the marquess
i understand i will believe that the vow you swore to me in laus  thats still in effect right
yes the service i vowed still holds true
 forgive me when it comes to my brother i 
that is only natural
 oswin this is for your ears alone if something happens in ostia  no matter what i will return to my brothers side ive been irresponsible and foolish in the past but  as the marquesss brother i will do anything required of me  so while im away in the west and anytime thereafter if you have any worries concerning my brother  no matter how trivial they might seem i want you to tell me  please
i understand   ill do as you ask 
then id better get going take care of things

why did you agree to give us passage when we said that we wished to travel to valor the people in the harbor treated us as though we were mad
im sure they did it is the dread isle after all if not for good reason we wouldnt want to go either
and yet  youve given us free passage why is that

captain theres a dory adrift to port it looks like theres someone aboard whatre your orders
bring em aboard  looks like weve got a visitor odd though finding a boat adrift near here 
odd why is that
the sea currents in this area  anything drifting around here mustve come from the dread isle
oh 
shall we greet our guest
  
eliwood  huh
if youre looking for eliwood hes talking with the captain
oh i wont bother him then
    do you need something
id like you to stop pouting this pirate ship is the only way for us to get to the dread isle i thought you understood that was i mistaken
how i feel or what i think is no concern of yours
eliwood told me about your parents and those bandits but these pirates they dont seem like bad fellows
it wasnt just my parents my entire tribe everyone was killed they poisoned our drinking water  my people were in such pain they could hardly stand  thats when the bandits attacked they waited until we were defenseless
  
my father put me on his horse and i escaped  just me my poor father  the pain must have been terrible he lifted me up his arms shaking   with his last breath  now do you understand i was found unconscious by another tribe and i awoke ten days later when i awoke  what i felt  the bodies of my people had already been buried i never even had the chance to say farewell my last memory of my father  he was broken dying i can still see the axes rising and falling it  its not  
hey what are you doing
youre a strong woman lyndis i thought you would not want anyone to see you cry
youre such a fool if you think thats what i want then why not just leave
i  i lost my parents too

ahoy well leave the fighting to you hold on until we can help oh and weve merchants aboard this is the armory this is the shop you wont be able to stock up once we reach the dread isle i suggest you buy as much as possible while youve the chance

cursed 
are you suggesting we leave ninian behind
we cant take her with us can we were heading for the dread isle its dread for a reason you know
regardless she goes with us
lyndis
when i saw her i remembered something the last time i saw ninian  she and her brother were being hunted by some dark robed men
dark robed are you sure
yes i think it must be the black fang it didnt occur to me before but now im certain
how can you be sure
i cant explain  theres something in the air that hints at their involvement
if its true then shes likely to be attacked again
almost certainly we cant leave her behind i will watch over her please 
i understand we should be by her side to protect her
thank you
were all going to that island will you come with us
yes  please take me with you
“something in the air”  are you some sort of hound
ah are you mocking me
no the opposite im in utter admiration  say eliwood when i left ostia i was attacked by a dark robed group
what why didnt you tell me this before
many people hold a grudge against ostia i didnt think it had anything to do with this until now 
hector do you think 
they were all wearing very distinct black robes i dont know about “something in the air” but  im convinced they were related
what in the world is happening in lycia  father  
weve arrived
thank you very much
well wait two weeks finish up by then
thats more than enough time
and ive got a half wit sailor who wants to go sightseeing cmere dart
im here captain ready to serve
were pleased to have you
his only redeeming feature is his sturdiness maybe hell come in handy
come on captain im bettern that
youve done so much  i cant thank you enough 
come back alive thats all the thanks i need
all right farewell
well be back before you know it
 there are good people even among pirates
i dont think the old man and his group are your average pirates
somewhere within that forest is the dragons gate
eliwood no matter what it takes were coming back with your father
 well surely find him well all do our best to make it so
youre right lets make preparations to enter the forest
oh
dragons gate 
ninian what is it
its nothing

a small altar lies on the outskirts of bulgar this ancient temple sacred to the people of sacae has long been known for its powerful bond to the world of spirits before starting their journey our travelers come here to pray for their well being at this altar lyns hand is directed to a grand inheritance
mark hold a moment and allow me a short detour there is a sacred sword enshrined in an altar east of here the people of sacae go there to pray for safety at the onset of a long journey
oh how quaint
the teachings of elimine have the most followers in elibe it is nice to see that here at least the ancient customs are still observed
old man stay where you are and hold your tongue
threaten me as you will but ill not give up the mani katti the mani katti is a sacred blade under divine protection it cannot be removed from its place of rest
youre a fool old man what goods a sword if you dont use it
use it in combat sacrilege
sacrilege i am glass the gods fear my name my swordplay is peerless and if i want this sword this sword i shall have now get out of my way
oof
this is it its more magnificent than id imagined this sword was made for a swordsman of my skill hmm whats this i cant  draw the sword  from its scabbard
the spirits of the blade have judged you you have been found waiting they have rejected you
what listen you senile old fool if you value your own life youll get out of my sight
curses miserable spirits i care nothing for you ill tear this altar down stone by stone
i beg your pardon milady are you headed east to the altar
yes we are indeed
then you must hurry and help the priest there i saw a band of local ruffians head in there not too long ago they seemed intent on stealing the altars sacred sword
the mani katti  theyre going to steal it i cannot allow this to happen
you look like a virtuous group please help him
lyndis what are you planning
if you go to the priests aid youll need to prepare
youre right  say mark  there are some homes to the south of us perhaps we should go there and question the residents
the three buildings to the south are homes you can speak with the people who live there they sometimes give you combat hints or useful information about the land and the people it pays to listen
shall i take the lead all right tell me what you would like me to do mark
the three buildings to the south are homes you can speak with the people who live there they sometimes give you combat hints or useful information about the land and its people it pays to listen
shall i take the lead all right tell me what you would like me to do tactician
im going to visit that home right just point me in the right direction
you want me to visit that home right i understand
first im going to visit that home right well lets go
say arent you the  oh youre going to help the priest well perhaps you could benefit from something i saw earlier  the bandits may have the main entrance guarded however one of the altars walls is cracked and in poor repair you might be able to create another entrance by hitting that section with your weapons were all counting on you
next send sain to visit another home start by selecting sain
its my turn to speak with the locals is it thats right
please i would like to help out however i can tactician direct me to the next residence
im next am i well im ready to go
its my turn next im ready to go
its my turn to speak with the locals is it thats right
please i would like to help out however i can tactician direct me to the next residence
mountains make it more difficult to be hit but theyre difficult to traverse if youre riding on horseback you cant cross them at all be careful
remember your mounted units possess the ability to move again after moving cavalry can move the rest of their movement range unless theyve received attack or staff commands this also goes for units mounted on pegasi and wyverns now give sain his orders
finally lets send kent to visit the remaining home this visit isnt necessary for combat purposes however its residents may have useful knowledge i recommand stopping by select kent
im next to move am i not i await your command
am i not supposed to visit that home please give me your guidance
do you know much about the sword held at the altar its called the mani katti blessed by the spirits according to the priest the mani katti is waiting for its rightful owner to appear its so odd dont you think the idea that a sword can choose who will wield it
you should know something about fortresses fortresses offer more protection than woods do fighting from a space in a fortress is beneficial remember this holds true for friend and foe alike keep this in mind before engaging your enemy fortresses also allow injured units to regain hit points your units automatically regain some hp at the beginning of your turn the hp you recover in one turn is fairly small as long as you remain in a fortress youll regain hp every turn so a full recovery is possible there are other places where units can recover hp including castle gates thrones and areas where bosses are found
this chapters goal is to seize the throne the leader of the enemy is on the throne now defeat him and have lyn seize the throne to finish this battle his name is glass hes a sword bearing mercenary think of the weapons triangle  what weapon is able to best a sword correct the lance using the right weapon is like a shortcut to victory to get to the altar try using the method that you heard earlier its up to you tactician good luck
sometimes youll get items after defeating enemies a single unit can carry a maximum of five itemsyou might need to drop some old items to pick up new ones bear this in mind you can see what items your enemies will drop by checking their inventories place the cursor on an enemy or ally then press the r button to view their personal data this data screen contains information about the unit youve selected press the  control pad left and right to change pages and view items if any of the items are glowing yellow you will get them if you defeat the unit dont forget
who do you think you are what chance do you think you have against me
you  you  urr urgh 
ah your clothing  are you of the lorca tribe
im lyn the chieftains daughter are you hurt sir
thanks to you i am unscathed you have my gratitude
and the sword is it safe
yes i have sealed the sword safely away until i remove my spell the sword cannot be drawn now as a token of my gratitude i shall allow you to lay hands upon the mani katti touch the blades pattern and pray for a safe journey
oh thank you so much
hm
what did—
the sword  its  glowing
ah hm  its the power of the spirits lyn they have looked into your soul and they call out to you
what does that mean
you are its rightful owner you are to wield the mani katti
no  i cant  i couldnt 
it is the swords wish if you require proof draw it from its sheath
um   
it came out  effortlessly
i never dared hope that i might meet the wielder of the mani katti in my life i am indeed fortunate to see your sword reach your hands
my sword
it is time for you to go lyn you face a great many ordeals grip this sword and meet your destiny head on
yes  yes sir
so this is the mani katti  a blade with no equal
this is all so unbelievable perhaps the most famous sword in all of sacae  in my hand
its not so strange in fact many legends tell similar tales  special blades all over the land call out to their proper owners and yet when i saw you draw that blade lyndis  i felt something extraordinary that sword was waiting for you you were meant to draw it
stop it i  im nothing special
think of it this way some weapons feel more comfortable in your hand right well the mani katti itself feels very comfortable with you does it make it any easier for you to accept it doesnt appear that either of us can use it
it  does feel right in my hand a blade that only i can wield that seems reasonable enough i can understand that look at it mark this is the mani katti this is  my sword i must care for it well
what madelyns daughter is still alive
uhh  yes lord lundgren the girl is traveling with kent and sain what are your orders if we let them be 
bah ive heard that northern bern is full of bandits shes just a girl shell not survive her journey here im more concerned with my older brother his life must be ended quickly the poison  there must be no blunders
yes mlord he suspects nothing and continues to drink it the marquesss death due no doubt to sudden illness is not far off
heh heh heh soon  soon caelin will be mine

 nergal should be back there should we wait for lord athos
if youre looking for me im right here
lord athos
youre late graybeard
 well were you successful
i was use this magic tome
what is it
a legendary item aureola the strongest light magic wielded by saint elimine herself with this we should be able to rend nergals dark cloak and do him much harm and these too have been infused with magic that makes them more effective against nergal durandal for eliwood and for hector armads
its  i can feel it already  its power is beyond words
incredible with this i know i cannot fail
 and lyndis this is for you
hm what blade is this
a spirit inhabited sword the partner of the mani katti this is the sol katti its not a legendary item but its blade contains much power
thank you
nils is nergal back there
unn  i sense tremendous power  what could it be i feel something really odd
he should have lost most of his henchmen in that last battle but  mm i read energy too  if only a little nils is right the sense of it is different than before brace yourselves he is formidable
we understand lets go everyone
tactician this is it the last battle lord athos spoke the truth about nergal  average men cannot hope to stand against him ordinary weapons hold no power against him those who go with us  they must be chosen carefully
lord eliwood  lord hector 
merlinus  thank you for everything
youre made of sterner stuff than id imagined thought youdve fled by now
 sniff sniff  i thought as much youre not taking me with you    sniff ooh 
thats disgusting cry if you must but do something about that runny nose what are we supposed to do you cant fight so we cant afford to take you with us
take this and return to farguss ship
 wh what is this may i ask
a letter of introduction take this to ostia and youll be able to do good business there of course if we fail in our mission its just a worthless slip of paper
but   i must protest for the rest of my days ive vowed in my heart to continue serving you both please oh please do not abandon me
merlinus    
then go get on the boat and pray for our safe return
 please have faith in us wait for us
 sniff sniff   i  i under stand until the end of time my lord i will wait for you until the end of time please come back  safely  please
yeah ok were going bye
well be back
  oh lord eliwood  oh my 
nergal
pah youre here but youre too late the gate is already opened i will claim the mighty quintessence of dragons i will become stronger and move ever closer to perfection
how many lives must you steal before youre satisfied and its not only those who die what about the ones left behind in pain and sorrow what about them
i am who i am the pain of others i do not feel the sorrow of others does not touch me death feeds me death pleases me i am the essence i consume you fools will become corpses here because i wish it to be rise and come forth my servants
this 
you seem impressed with my work or perhaps its just that youve seen a familiar face
thats  marquess laus and  those are black fang members what have you done nergal
these morphs you see before you ive given them the abilities and appearances of the people whose essences i used to craft them well thats not entirely true ive made them far more powerful this is the ideal plan for hypocrites like you especially you eliwood you continue to regret causing harm to anyone even enemies however no matter the reason once the deed is done its done whether you enjoy it or not is irrelevant  the result is the same
it is not the same if you feel no horror for taking someones life  then you you yourself are not alive
heh heh heh  your weakness runs deep in you you can never understand the concepts of good and evil are devoid of any meaning any value these ideas prevent humans from liberating their own strengths such foolishness  the ultimate foolishness of the human race
nergal after all these years  you have not stopped to reconsider your ideas at all
the same is true of you athos you must see the truth of it all living creatures take energy from somewhere we all use it to create to change it into something better the knowledge of arcadia has shown us the road to the ultimate transformation and yet you will not take that road why do you reject the obvious
i am not opposed to the quest for power for greater knowledge however that quest must be driven from within to fuel your quest with the stolen lives of others this brings not wisdom but abomination
heh heh heh  i remember i still remember those words are unchanged from when you first said them ages back when you and the dragons conspired to bury me
look at this wound the wound i took from your magic it was a mistake the only person who understood  the man i thought my truest friend  it was a mistake to try and destroy me heh heh heh heh  it confirmed some things for me that trust brings betrayal that friends bring weakness
if that is what you learned from your encounter then you are a fool do you believe for a moment that when wise athos struck down his dearest friend he felt nothing his heart was torn in two and yet you refuse to understand that
eliwood 
nergal i will defeat you here today but even now there is no hatred in my heart you who were born human you who lost the heart that defines your humanity  for you i have nothing but pity
 pity heh heh heh  amusing a weak fool like you has pity for me interesting  now if you hope to defeat me you may have your chance of course you will have to best my morphs first
listen to me this is my fight now mine alone everyone stay back
hey what are you talking about weve come this far together havent we
thats right ive said it before we all feel the same way
hector  lyndis 
dont forget me lord eliwood and ninian im sure shes here as well
nils  ah tactician you too
ill show you the strength of a knight of pherae
knights should fight not speak  was that right
ill do whatever i can to help
 winning this battle means protecting my family
whooooooooooa im burning up
for the honor of the knights of ostia
let me handle this theres much i can do
blessed saint elimine grant us strength to win this with ease
let me show you how much my blade has matured
i dont want to lose anyone so i will fight my strongest
for years ive studied now let those studies show their worth
i  i ill do my best
i will gladly volunteer to protect lycia with my life
i wont hold back this is for all the lovely ladies ive yet to meet
weve made it this far lets get out there and win
if i die here  so be it
blessed saint elimine please grant us a miracle 
let this battle be forgotten by history  that is all i ask
im dart brave crewman of farguss pirates and i fear nothing
for the honor of the pegasus knights of ilia i will annihilate the foe
my oh my  fools aplenty that includes me too
for bern land of my birth  may i return to it soon
for those whose reasoning is bent i will straighten it with my bow
my pride shall not be broken my strength holds true
 i too will join you in this final glory
hey theres no doubt well win just dont forget my bonus
if he has power to rival athos then i must test that power myself
no matter what happens ill be at lord pents side
lord elbert  i will protect your son
as long as theres someone to cut you will have my aid
im trembling with anticipation
this looks like fun this is what ive been waiting for
 father  brothers   for all that ive lost  i wont let him get away
  
ive lived long enough ive no regrets 
what are you worried about with me here we cant lose
it is for this moment that i have lived 
everyone  lets go weve got to stop nergal
everyone  here we go give it your all and beat this knave
eliwood wait
what is it lyndis
is it true what nergal said
you mean about lord uther
he said hes dead  when– did you know eliwood
 hector has been acting a little strange  so i forced oswin to tell me it was the same illness that took his father the sickness came on suddenly it took less than a year for the disease to spread
so when we met him in castle ostia he was 
he was dying  yet he  he didnt want hector or us to know  he pushed himself too far im sure he was told he shouldnt be moving about 
hector when  when did he 
only recently  he figured it out when he saw lord uther wasnt at the castle he pressed oswin to tell him   after that so as not to distract us hector pretended that nothing was amiss 
    thats no–  thats 
lyndis 
hector  do you have a minute
its about my brother isnt it sorry i didnt tell you
its all right i understand you better than anyone more importantly have you settled things with oswin
 dont talk to me about him
hector  youre not angry with oswin when lord uther was in trouble you werent at his side youre angry with yourself its true isnt it i was the same way i couldnt save my father  i couldnt save ninian  over and over i blamed myself 
eliwood 
but you know thats just a way of running from the sadness of loss i think youve realized that already lord uther and oswin  they were thinking of you above all else you must see that but if you continue to pretend you do not you will lost sight of something terribly valuable thats all i have to say
  
oswin
lord hector what is it
 its ok i uhm  i dont have any more doubts nergals time is up
yes sir and i oswin will be at your side no matter what
 what is it
hector  im certain that  you did not cry  so i will  this is your share of tears  dont say anything just for a little while let me lean on you for a little while 
  
             dont 
hm
 dont die  please you–
 i know
     
 huh even as a monster you are a handsome one lloyd but you know something i cant let this continue
     
ah lloyd   sniff oh   why does this have to happen again
     
oh  we meet again  linus  this stinks
     
linus  ill see you again  im sure youre angry but  please be my friend again 
     
 uhai why did this blasphemy occur  ill put an end to it right away
     
 commander  i really didnt want to see you like this  all i can give you is one last act of rebellion
     
father  fa father  i  ill end this  im sorry 
be prepared you are to be witness to a power that overwhelms all
nergal
so youre here eliwood i thought losing ninian might distract you have you forgotten her so quickly how heartless
i havent forgotten ill never forget it was my mistake that killed ninian because of that  i will fight i will not run away and hide in sorrow  im going to put an end to all this
did you know eliwood what happened to your friend hector what he was thinking as he fought by your side
  
heh heh  its a pity if only he had been free to return to ostia
i know that ive caused much pain for my friends but that is why  i will not lose here today
little girl from sacae  youd do well to vanish one such as you is no match for me
the nomads of the plains do not abandon their fellow tribespeople eliwood and hector are my dear friends  their sorrow is my sorrow their anger is my anger
pah 
nergal in my friends names i will cut you down
  
uhn who do you think you are
you will pay you stole my family from me and you will pay nergal i will avenge them all
now i see  youre sonias 
  
hmph  its you jaffar turning your sword against me your master do you forget who raised you you are worthless
 wrong i am a man
oh really if so then i will give you a mans death
 nergal do you remember me
hah you are  renault so youre still seeking out a wretched existence
i went astray i listened to your honeyed words  i dreamt of the impossible  the return of a lost soul but what you gave me was  a puppet  it was soulless nothing more than an empty vessel
just an empty vessel  isnt that what you wanted you desired to bring back your dead friend you were my experiment and i completed my morph im grateful renault thanks to you i gained power
you villain  you cursed him your crime can never be forgiven i will end you with my hands in the name of my lost friend
nergal
so youve come hector of ostia your existence itself was my greatest miscalculation if it had only been eliwood this could have been over so my little miscalculation i will erase you and leave no trace remaining
do your worst
nergal
i cannot understand you hector of ostia why would you do all this for eliwood is this miserable thing called friendship worth dying for
i dont expect you to understand youve forgotten what it means to be human nergal my connection to you  its over im finishing everything up right here
nergal 
heh heh  athos  take a good look at me at my tremendous power
already words are useless as an old friend  i will fulfill my duty
why why must i lose more power  i must be  stronger  i  why why did i  want power   quintessence  dont under stand  but  gaa  not like this  i will not die like this with my last breath  tremble and despair hwah ha ha  ha ha ha ha

ninian
lord eliwood 
im so happy i cant believe youre back i feel like this is all a dream once i lost you  i knew for sure i need you i want you by my side forever
lord eliwood i   i must go home 
what do you mean
im the cause of all of this it was my weakness that invited this tragedy 
ninian
here on elibe   we were nurtured for ages in the land of our birth even after humans invaded and drove us out  not a day passed that i did not think of it i yearned to see it once again  our homeland  those children  the fire dragons they were like me 
 
we knew that it was forbidden and yet we answered nergals call and opened the gate  we didnt intend to stay long  just to see home one last time but nergal captured us and  it led to this
we humans we took control of the continent like it was our right we never considered who or what we drove away   ninian nils the blame for this was never yours alone while we can claim ignorance we still bear some responsibility
 lord eliwood do you truly believe that
i do if my father were here he would say the same thing lets work together and think about the future if the entire continent were made a place where dragons and humans could live together like the hidden city lord athos spoke of arcadia 
what a wonderful world that would be but thats certainly something that wont happen for a long long time so we  we cant stay here the gate is still open if it remains so other dragons will certainly pass through before that happens we must return to our world we must regain our power and seal the gate from that side
are you saying ill never see you again that cant be
lord eliwood i am truly blessed that i have had the chance to meet you please  please  dont forget me
ninian
  come nils let us go we must return to our world 
ninian  the air of this world its changed so much from what we knew no matter how much time passes our strength will never return if we stay here we will not survive long
nils why do you 
but even knowing that your life will be short ninian you truly wish to remain here dont you i understand  stay here stay with lord eliwood
nils
lord eliwood  ninian  no my sister  please cherish her
i will i will make her happy  i swear it
nils you  are you 
mm im going alone i want to live a long time i dont have your curiosity
 nils

/***EOF***/
at last eliwoods long awaited reunion with his father as well as their painful farewell after escaping the dread isle they return to the port city of badon eliwood remains silent for the duration of their passage he sits cradling his fathers cold hand as if to warm him back to life
they find the man for whom theyve been searching marquess pherae he breathes his last in the embrace of his son eliwood the companions leave the dragons gate and set sail for badon eliwood is grief stricken at his fathers death hector can find no words to comfort his friend
 ninian are you feeling better
yes 
thats good  long time no see nils youve grown havent you
 is it really you lyndis it seems like its been so long
even though its only been a year since i saw you last
so much has happened since we left you and caelin
hey care to talk about things the rest of us can follow
hmph whos he
this is hector hes marquess ostias brother dont let his attitude fool you he acts mean but hes decent enough
acts mean seems pretty mean to me
heehee  and you might remember this one hes 
yep i remember hes the man who helped ninian youre elberts son arent you your red hair gentle eyes and even voice youre just like him
where did you meet my father
at the dragons gate he set us free after wed been captured we escaped in a small boat but i was thrown out in a storm when i woke up i was back on valor for a time i hid in the ruins by myself then  i sensed something really dangerous when i raced to the dragons gate i  i saw everything
 nils
when we pulled ninian from the boat shed lost her memory i cant believe we brought her right back to her captors what a horrible thing to do  im sorry
lady lyn  lady lyn you did nothing wrong   when nils fell overboard i didnt know what to do  i became lost within myself if only id been stronger    all of this could have been avoided  i am  truly  sorry
 ninians power is greater than mine but it costs her physical and emotional strength   nergal exploited that  weakness 
 ninian  nils 
 was he after you because you have the power to call dragons
 i think its because we can open the dragons gate just calling them nergal can do that on his own
are you serious
yes but it requires a tremendous amount of quintessence
quintessence
thats what nergal called it the substance of the human spirit  power energy the essence of life itself  nergal he stole this quintessence
 what happens to those whose quintessence is stolen
 they  they die 
  
neither ninian nor i have that power lyn knows we only have our special power  anyway nergal needed to gather a large amount of quintessence so he sent his henchman ephidel to get close to marquess laus he sought to plant the seeds of war in darins power hungry heart
 to what end
it seems the quintessence in each person varies in strength a person of strong mind and body has hundreds of times more energy than the average person it sounds like there arent many people like that though it took too long for nergal to find people with enough strength although it would take time nergal said the easiest way to get that much quintessence was by starting a war
 so he planned to make up for quality with quantity is that it black hearted fiend are all men nothing but pawns to him
 ephidel brought elbert to the dragons gate he said hed found the ideal source they had sought nergals plans for war had been stopped and yet  he was happy hed taken so much energy from the knights traveling with elbert he was sure hed get even better quintessence from elbert 
nils
oh im sorry  lord eliwood
its all right   when i found my father at the dragons gate i knew his knights were no longer alive 
eliwood 
 your father told us that he had a son he said you were blessed with natural fighting ability but he also told us you were compassionate and disdained fighting he told us that his son would be a better ruler than he was
  
he told us that he would sooner sacrifice himself than see his homeland lycia embroiled in the flames of war
 thats 
when wed lost all hope at the dragons gate your father always spoke to us of happy things  well he mainly spoke of his cherished son and his dear wife but ninian and i  we loved him very much his stories about his family   they saved us
oh fa    father    
 
 hector
we should let him be alone for a while 
 sure come on ninian nils
 as you say
 lord eliwood 
hm ninian  i didnt see you im sorry about before i just  needed some time to think
 
should you be up youve had a rough time  your colorings not very good you should rest
 
 look at you all scratches and bruises  you need to be properly taken care of 
 why
hm
why was lord elbert so  lord eliwood why were you both  so kind to us its  this is  this is all my fault  these nightmares  all these terrible things 
ninian crying ill suits a girl of your beauty im fine  please dont cry
im sorry  so  sorry 
theres something you must hear youre not responsible for what happened to my father you suffered as much as he did please dont punish yourself further
 lord eliwood  i  i  ah
huh what is it
 oh 
ninian
 enemies    enemies draw near
so what do we do now
i wonder what happened to nergal lord elbert gave him a grievous wound when he stabbed him
his wounds will not kill him
thats what lord elbert said too do you know what he meant
nergal uses quintessence on himself as well his wounds heal quickly  his body does not age
so he isnt  human
 if nothing else hes  ah
what is it
call everyone enemies approach
bah eliwood deserves a little more time to rest 
well then well handle this ourselves shall we
here you all are
ah
eliwood
listen get ready for battle i want to get this over with quickly to protect villagers meet the enemy commander and drive them out of here
het little guy go hide in the village
no way i can help you out
nils you really are a big help but  shouldnt you be with ninian now
ah  all right
lets go
ninian stop where are you going
i  im going to help
oh no youre not youre still too weak
but  i merely wish to help lord eliwood  even if just a little i  i stole his fathers life from him   i know this  this will never make up for it  nils please 
 i understand give me your hands
nils
ill give you some of my power youll just get in the way if you go out like this
nils im sorry
 whew that should do it help them for me too
thank you
lord eliwood
ninian you shouldnt be here
 please allow me to help
help ive no intention of making you fight 
 im no mere dancer my dances  they will help you
 this is   im wrapped in  some sort of  energy 
i used niniss grace and danced for you lord eliwood it will only last a short while but while it does you are protected  please  allow me  to remain at your side
ninian  of course if it will make you feel better lets rejoin the battle dont leave my side
ok
mark please tell me what you want me to do i cannot fight but  i can aid with my dance i ask for your understanding and assistance
cant believe badons under attack if only fargus were here  say ive got something here you can use to buy some time set this light rune and itll block the enemies advance only thing is itll stop allies too so  watch your step
ah  those emerald eyes that lustrous blue hair  she was  so beautiful beautiful beyond words  if only i could see her again  a lovely knight of pherae searching for her lord   i wonder why shes a knight a famed knight and me thats a dream of a dream  wah you  i  i was just thinking out loud  you  didnt hear anything did you waaaaaaaaa you mustnt tell anyone promise me you mustnt
why all the noise its the middle of the night what a fight are you going to do something really then  here take this it should aid you its a restore staff itll wake you from sleep and cure poison basically itll cure whats wrong and bring you back to normal now im tired  why cant you people fight at a decent hour
are you a mercenary you all look like youve been fighting for years and years what kind of tactician would put together a group like yours
hey wasnt that a wyvern rider that flew by here a while back i want to know what berns wyvern riders are doing here are we under attack cmon do something ive heard that wyvern riders are fast and really tough sure arrows and magic can bring them down but  thisll cause ‘em trouble too its a wyrmslayer here take care of ‘em
you need special items to change classes the items different for different units too cavaliers and knights need a knight crest folks skilled in magic and staves need a guiding ring and wyvern riders and pegasus knights need this an elysian whip you can have it dont be shy now its not like ill ever be able to use it now if i were a cute little pegasus knight id use it in an instant
it ends here your journey is over and only oblivion awaits you
in defeat  there is only  death urgh  
 black fang
i bring an invitation from my master nergal return the children to me seems foolish to deliver the message  after all i can take them both myself and go now
youll never take them
hey are you ok
mm sorry to worry you
you dont have to push yourself so
well have time for mourning when this is all finished for now in my fathers name  i will do everything i can to stop nergal and protect our lands
i see so what do you have in mind
 we need to see marquess ostia
my brother
after all weve learned  we cant not tell him can we
sure i guess 
hector why that odd expression
hector doesnt want to meet lord uther hes been lax in contacting him and is afraid to face him right
what and how did you expect me to send him messages when were traipsing about the isles like merchants on holidays
ha ha ha he is going to be so mad
cmere
ha  theyre both in good spirits  its a lot better than giving in to despair i suppose
lord eliwood  are you feeling better
marcus  im fine i know i worried you
about lord elbert  at my own discretion i sent a messenger to lady eleanora
 i see thank you marcus that was well done
 i thought she should know as soon as possible the marquesss final moments were so  very noble 
  
lord eliwood commander marcus
ah
is  is that you isadora
ive finally found you im glad youre well 
isadora what are you doing here dont tell me somethings happened to mother 
no lady eleanora is well do not worry when word of lord elberts death reached her yesterday  she said not a word  she merely gave her full attention to the messenger
 mother
then she issued me orders without hesitation she commanded i deliver this sword to lord eliwood and remain at his side
but  the castle defenses will be shorthanded
lord eliwood  please  understand your mothers feelings lord elbert is not coming home all your mother can do now is pray for your continued safety obey your fathers dying wish that is her message to you and i have delivered it
why not petition ostia for reinforcements to help ward castle pherae
 good idea i guess it would ease my mothers fears and bow to her wishes
its that thinking that makes you lord eliwood
our battles are like nothing youve ever prepared for  are you ready to face them isadora
yes i will serve with my very life
tactician is something wrong oh you were worried about me i apologize for all of the trouble im fine now i have my friends to lean on hector lyndis and you tactician  thanks to all of you im getting stronger i am coming to believe that together we can overcome anything
sonia limstella
you called lord nergal
  
my wound  needs time it was a deep cut and my strength is not what it was the man who did this to me is dead id like his sons death as compensation sonia you will use brendan to move the black fang i do not need mere underlings now i need the four fangs
hee hee leave it to me ill have them bowing their heads to you my lord
limstella i want you to gather me quintessence for this injury to heal i will need much you are the strongest of all my morphs kill all those who bear signs of great power
as you will 
/***EOF***/
a mysterious group seems hell bent on capturing nils and ninian  having failed this group the black fang flees rumor has them traveling southwest lyn and her colleagues follow in hopes of recovering a lost heirloom the black fang have made a stronghold of an abandoned castle in khathelet its dark halls are alive with shadowy figures 
so the brother escaped and the sister was rescued by a band of strangers do i understand you
yes  they ambushed us and 
hold your excuses the end is all that matters
yes maam
and your plan for recovering the siblings is
weve word the entire group is heading this way with the brats in tow
theyre coming here why would they do that
they may well be after this ring  its a rare piece we took it from the girl it was a stroke of luck that we did especially if it brings them to us now ill grab the whole lot of em with this to bait the trap
i see  very well ill give you another chance ive business elsewhere but i shall return once its finished you have until sunrise tomorrow do you understand
yes
if you do not have the children when i return my hand will deal you the fangs punishment remember that bear it closely in your mind
  
i believe they went in there
milady are you really going in there to get the ring back
yes we are
but this is their stronghold theyre bound to be well defended not to mention well armed
please forget about the ring its ok 
tacticians agreed to attempt this recovery i wouldnt be here if not for that tactician believes we can do this and im sure that decision was not made lightly with tactician at my side im confident we can win lets get you ring back ninian
milady 
  
milady lyndis there are more of the foe inside than we thought
this is their stronghold its imperative we move carefully
exactly milady this narrow corridor can be used to our advantage if we draw the enemy through here we can engage them in small numbers and remain relatively safe if time is a concern we can always rush them  if we do that wed better be sure we can win
so tactician what do you think how we move forward is completely up to you
how this cant be  they should be dead everyone get in there and finish them this is our final chance

the next morning comes too quickly lyn has fought back the bandits attack now she rushes for the border of bern if she can reach it lycia itself is not far off for a moment lyn stops to imagine the face of a grandfather shes never seen
weve almost reached the lycian border
once we cross well be safe from the bandits right
we should be i doubt theyll be willing to pursue us across the border
lycia at last its been a long time tomorrow well dine on a feast of lycias finest foods and the mistress of the inn at the crossing is said to be a beauty ah yes  food and love no better way to restore a mans soul this is going to be a fine evening eh kent
if your behavior is as deplorable as ever wed best stay elsewhere were not here for sightseeing
oh come now thats not fair
kent the inn will be fine
as you say milady
lyndis you are truly an angel from on high
its nothing forget it
ah well finally be able to get a good nights sleep
oh no  those bandits are persistent ill give them that much
ah here they are ive found em
what not again theyre still after us
heh heh heh dont think youre getting away so easily
you leave alive and everyonell think the ganelon bandits have gone soft
so we care nothing for you or your reputations we must get to lycia get in our way and youll pay
cheeky little thing arent you lets get em lads and no holding back just cause theres women with em wipe em out
oooh  were lost this makes me so mad
you told me you were certain this was the correct path
whats your point erk what are you trying to say
 i swear you are not the woman i agreed to escort 
what whats that supposed to mean
i heard someone was needed to escort a frail lycian priestess to ostia 
yes and im that priestess
frail you serra you have no need of any escort to protect you even the most hardened criminal would flee in terror after five minutes in your company ill return your money gladly now will you please go on to ostia alone
no youre my escort erk mine youre so clean and tidy a noblewoman like myself cant be seen without a proper escort your personalitys nothing special but youre not bad to look at
i believe thats my line and i have to take you all the way to ostia i only hope my nerves can endure the journey
what are you mumbling about youre so gloomy hm somethings happening over there lets take a look
ah of course the first opportunity to get involved in trouble and she jumps right in no amount of money is worth this hoo 
wow a fight a fight erk take a look fighting those bandits  its a young girl
fool keep your voice down
eh whats this you in league with that she devil
hm
ah  this is so wrong 
gyaaa ill take care of you with one swift stroke
eeeeeek eeeeeek eeeeeeeeeeeek erk help me
so loud  serra behind me you there see if you can match me
that scream  look tactician someones over there
sometimes you can talk to different npcs  the process is the same as talking to enemies give it a try please select lyn
you want me to talk to that person understood
im supposed to talk to that person right give the order
um excuse me  hello
hm
why are you fighting these bandits
  it just happened
thats not true those ruffians thought that we were with you you got us into a terrible situation now how are you going to get us out
serra if youd not been so meddlesome this all could have been avoided my apologies please trouble yourself with us no more
but if youre going to have to fight anyway shouldnt we team up it will end things faster right
thats true yes thats a good idea erk go and help these ladies
but i  fine
very good my names lyn so tell me will you join arms with us
yes wed be glad to my name is serra this is my escort erk be a good boy and go fight now erk
 sigh 
erk a mage and serra a cleric have joined your group mages use the magic of truth to attack and damage their enemies clerics use staves to restore hp to their allies lets try them both first select serra
hello youre tactician right im serra nice to meet you by the way see this contrary mage here with me his name is erk i think hes been hurt i am erks employer “master” i suppose you could say what im getting at is  i was thinking of healing him free of charge i know i know im generous to a fault hm why are you looking at me like that praise my generosity anyway thats the deal please direct me to him
please direct me
press the a button and select the staff from the menu
im going to use my staff watch in wonder
my staff let me use my staff
clerics cannot wield weapons therefore they cant engage in combat however they can use their staves to restore hp to allied units besides healing staves which restore hp there are other staves with different abilities its always a good idea to test out any new abilities you receive so lets do that now have erk demonstrate his magic begin by selecting erk
you are tactician i am erk im not sure how i got in this mess if im going to fight however i will show you the true power of magic
i will show you the true power of magic
magic like dorcass throwing axes can strike enemies in adjacent squares as well as those at a distance its very useful magic can penetrate even the strongest defenses so it can be used in many situations however mages have few hp and low defensive abilities to avoid counter attacks move in close to archers and attack other fighters from 1 space away try and formulate combat strategies like this to be successful on the field of combat
magic can be used to attack enemies both near and far plus you might find that magic can hit an enemy that normal weapons do not harm however  mages are notoriously susceptible to physical attacks just because theyre versatile doesnt mean you should put them in harms way it does you no good if they are lost because of your carelessness
tell me are you using the r button if theres something you dont understand use the r button to investigate its essential place the cursor on a unit and press the r button this displays detailed information on the unit you knew that right while that information is displayed press the r button again that will get you even more detailed information did you know that the r button can be used in many other places too anyway when you come across something unfamiliar try pressing the r button wont hurt to remember that  ah so youre a traveler listen to my advice handle your money wisely if you spend too much too soon youll run out early and suffer later there are other shops so save about oh half of your money
youre gonna learn why people fear the ganelon bandits
blaaaaah  scum  youre all scum 
nicely done tactician that should just about do it
what a surprise you are very strong lyn
your staff is a wondrous thing healing powers amaze me
only those in the service of good can wield them
you helped us tremendously well its time for us to go

to the west of elibe lies an archipelago known as the western isles here a sacred weapon lies waiting the seal guarding it broken however to retrieve the weapon one must pass a trial armads a sacred axe filled with the destructive force of thunder to wield it one must prove ones worth hector faces a test unlike any hes ever experienced
hey its pitch black in here agh and its full of smoke  hey graybeard athos you sure this is the right place
yes armads the legendary weapon of durban the berserker who took its name as his own armads is here
if ive got that i can help out eliwood cant i
this battle axe is so tremendous that normal men cannot even lift it however its possible that you might be strong enough
cmon lets go i want to get my hands on it
slow down you fool the spirits of the soldiers who once fought at our side against the dragons now guard the legendary weapon even in death
 and if i can get through them i can take the axe right
there are more of them than id imagined you cant do this alone you must have help
fine with me but how many people can come with me
too many will simply serve to excite the guardians call as few allies as possible
bah  i dont get it but ill do as you say
 be on guard hector every act of strength you perform has consequences 
dont worry ill get that axe now if were calling allies lets call them and get moving
hmph  you are a bold one that is your strength but also your weakness your recklessness may one day be your undoing 
i am kaim you who search for power  you must prove your worth to me 
tremendous strength  truly like his 
 seal    could not   protect  such regret 
all right this is the throne athos graybeard i made it

what is going on here
i am power power without peer i am the dragonhunter i am the fleshbiter the bonecrusher the skullbreaker the doombringer
  
i require no seals i have no need of this idleness called peace power unused is power wasted better to lie spent in the grave than to sit in wait i care not who  i would fight someone 
this is one dangerous looking fellow  hey durban  i mean armads  whatever doesnt matter hey you lend me your strength
you desire strength then prepare yourself once you have gained such power  your life will not end in a comfortable bed you will die on the battlefield in the savage garden of wars bloody delights
 i dont care i will help my friend thats why ive come this far armads your power lend it to me
 it is yours
hector
what have you been doing im glad to see that youre well 
hey i told you not to worry here look at this its the thunder hammer

i will use this to battle nergal come to the dragons gate  what

lyn takes her leave of araphen finding no aid from its spiteful marquess now she and her companions resume their march toward caelin in earnest racing against time with her grandfathers life the prize harried and impatient lyn presses onward suddenly a young boy appears and pleads for their assistance

ah  so you want to help the kid huh what a shame youre gonna die for something that dont concern you
you think so do you do we look so meek to you i think youre in for a terrible shock
stupid girl  youll regret those words take em down boys
starting with this chapter youll be able to use the preparations screen on this screen you can choose who will fight equip different items and arrange your formation among other things if you have no special preparations to make simply press start this starts the chapter with the same group you were using at the end of the last chapter
i see were facing a shaman mark ive heard that practitioners of the dark arts are fearsome foes well have to be careful  what who are you
please forgive me i never meant to startle you
your robes  they look like religious vestiary are you an elimine bishop
yes  well no im only an acolyte an elimine monk to be specific my names lucius
do you have business with us
i was at the inn when this child came seeking help the innkeeper was afraid to get involved he was unpleasant
i wasnt afraid of him im used to being treated that way
thats awful
may i please lend you my services i truly wish to help the boy if only a little
of course
thank you very much the blessings of st elimine be upon you
the monk lucius has joined your group monks are users of the magic of light whose who wield magic are highly attuned to its flow so they have a high magic resistance units with high magic resistances can reduce the damage caused by magical attacks when magic users battle each other they often find it hard to inflict damage the light magic of monks is strong against the dark magic favored by shamans lucius should come in handy here lets put his magic to the test have lucius attack the shaman nearest him
mark isnt it i am lucius i await your orders
you wish for me to attack the shaman very well
i beg your pardon but i would prefer to attack from here
i can help too
nils can you fight
no  but im a bard and bards are useful to have around
a bard do you mean youre a minstrel this is no place for a ballad or a saltarello
cmon trust me im all yours mark
its time to see what nils can do the music played by bards allows your allies to move twice in the same turn however bards cannot engage in combat so be careful not to expose them to danger
mark im nils id like to perform for youm so give the word
youd like me to play for lucius right
i have to be next to him so he can hear my tune
what do you think
that was lovely  invigorating even you ought to play for me sometime i could use the boost
everyone could my music can refresh you all
through the power of nilss music lucius can move again this turn bards gain experience by playing music use nilss powers often and increase his skill
hmmm  maybe i could get some firewood out of it  hm whos there who are you ah youre just passing through pay me no mind i was just thinking out loud you see theres an old tree on the other side of this mountain its just a dead old snag really i was just thinking of some way i could put it to good use as i said its nothing that need concern you
thats quite a group youve gotten yourself involved with you do know youre facing the black fang right anyone they target winds up  well you know no one escapes the fang thats what they say anyway you and those odd children id say youre finished not that ill have any part of it course not
blast eliwoods late i wonder whats keeping him   starting to think my axell rust over before he finds his way here
excuse me is anyone home an empty house  how dull
whew  i thought she would find me for sure shes been working for my brother in bern and now shes returned  ahh 
huh milord what brings you here
ah matthew eliwood and i are here for our monthly bout
youre still testing one anothers fighting prowess eh its a solid friendship you two share that you can practice so faithfully
if you dont sharpen your blade you lose your edge so tell me what are you doing here
milord uther was curious about the succession issue here
oh the long lost granddaughter thing right so which way does my brother lean
by my assessment he will back the granddaughters claim the marquesss brother lundgren is too ambitious by far left alone we might wake to find him at ostias door before long
sound advice i think
my return to ostia is going to be delayed a bit would you mind letting lord uther know
what so the marquesss brother is now your personal messenger
you always did have a good sense of humor milord dont forget my message
what impudence
so how much do you know about magic huh magical attacks are special you cant just avoid em like a sword or an axe not even if youre wearing armor whos tough against magic let me think  well anyone who uses magic or staves pegasus knights too hm you got others who need to battle magic users i got something for em its a special kind of water pure water its called just sprinkle a bit on you itll protect you and lessen the damage you take a bit go on take it dont be so shy itsnot like im givin you gold or anything this stuffs strongest when you first put it on it gets weaker as time passes so be careful
who are you supposed to be playing the heroes in some foolish knightly romance you may think youre helping the children but youre only rushing to your doom
you were only  striking at air  you are too late the girl is already  
nils wheres your sister
ninian ninian  shes not here why where could she be
my lady lyndis a villager spotted a group of men riding south
the boys dear sister  they must have her
come we must give chase
but  but  we wont make it what if theyve already 
are you looking for this girl here
ninian ninian
shell be fine shes just lost consciousness
who are you
im eliwood of pherae my father os the marquess
the marquesss son 
she was with a band of ruffians she seemed upset she looked in need of rescuing  was i wrong to involve myself
no you saved her life thank you my name is lyn im from sacae im marquess caelins granddaughter
marquess caelin
and thats my story its not an easy tale to believe i know 
no i do believe you
what
at first glance all i saw was a daughter of the plainsfolk now i can see it though you have your grandfathers eyes
do you know my grandfather
the marquess lord hausen is my fathers good friend i also know that the proud people of sacae tell no lies its true isnt it
yes  thank you i would not have expected any lycian noble to be so courteous to a sacaean nomad
you seemed to be in trouble may i be of assistance
thank you for your kind offer this is my problem though and ill deal with it
i see ill be in the area for a few days longer if you need anything please let me know lyndis im on your side
eliwood  thank you
ninian are you awake
nils is it really you oh youre safe
uh huh these people helped me
who are they
uh 
im lyn im glad youre feeling better
milady lyn  thank you im called ninian my brother nils and i are traveling performers
both of you your borthers a musician how about you ninian
i  i dance
what oh my  youre a dancer
sain  later please
um yeah of course
a dancer your clothes dont look like those of a dancer
ninian dances to honor life its special  sacred
a sacred dance what does that mean
i  the dance i perform when we travel is just a normal dance my other dance though  when they caught me i twisted my ankle i cannot dance to aid you  im sorry
please dont worry were just happy to see that youre out of harms way
thank you
but i am concerned about your leg you cant travel on it 
ive an idea would it be too much to ask that we travel with you
i cant allow that its far too dangerous were being hunted we never know when were going to be attacked
we wouldnt be a hinderance we could even help you right ninian
yes we might be able to repay our debt using our special talents
special abilities
when something poses a threat to us we can sense its approach
truly thats amazing
we can feel it coming but we cant do anything to stop it youre warriors though so you dont have that worry
what do you think kent
i think leaving them here would cause lady lyndis more worry than having them travel with us
sain oh never mind i know what your answer is do you really want to travel with us
of course
you have our gratitude milady
oh 
whats wrong ninian
ive lost my ring
your ring
not ninis grace
the very one
they stole it those curs
was it valuable
it was a keepsake from our departed mother
it was blessed by the spirit of ninis  theres no other like it in the world and now we have lost it to those villains theres nothing we can do
youre right
  
can i talk to you mark you heard all of that right what do you think id really love to retrieve ninians ring for her but if nils is right those thieves might prove to be too strong for us what should we do
when you fulfill certain conditions side quests may make themselves apparent to you side quests allow you to learn things that arent part of the main story you might meet tough new enemies or find new companions to travel with however side quests are very difficult and once you begin one you must see it through to its end if you plan to challenge a side quest i suggest you keep the save data from the previous mission not accepting side quests will not effect your ranking if youre in a hurry to pursue the main story skip the side quests
you want to help them thats great i was hoping youd say that mark kent sain those men were headed south we must give pursuit
on your word milady
theres no turning back now lets ride
/***EOF***/
a month has passed since word came of marquess pheraes disappearance rumors and speculation run rampant throughout lycia the head of house ostia lord uther takes no apparent interest the marquesss younger brother is considered odd by the populace he and marquess pheraes son eliwood are fast friends a hot blooded youth he cannot ignore his friends plight marquess ostias younger brother hector he would one day be a courageous general a steel warrior to be feared the path he chooses will test him to the limits of his strength
brother brother where is he hes here isnt he
lord hector calm yourself
no words oswin just move
thats enough hector what is the meaning of this
you know full well the disappearance of marquess pherae
weve discussed this time and time again this matter is none of ostias affair we have no reason to involve ourselves it would be folly to do so
eliwoods father is missing for goodness sake we know that marquess laus is connected in some way i say we use ostias might to end this mystery and find the truth
calm yourself you fool an invasion would be madness lycia can ill afford the chaos such an action would bring surely even you must understand that
bah  i understand all too well brother stay there on your throne sit there until it rots beneath you i will do this alone
lord hector you should watch your tone 
peace oswin let him go theres no reasoning with him when he gets like this
  
matthew matthew blast it where could he be
im right here
you  youre not a wraith stop skulking in the shadows like one
hm a wraith and here i thought i was a spy be that as it may as milord ordered here are your travel rations and your beloved axe and ive purchased the silence of some royal guardsmen youre free to slip out the rear entrance and vanish
well done matthew try not to let my brother discover my absence too quickly
what i thought i was going with you
youre a bigger fool than id imagined did you think i would trust my brothers spy who knows when you would turn me in for some favor where i go i go alone
shh you keep on shouting and youll go nowhere every guard in the palace must have heard that
enough  do not try and follow me
i did not imagine you would find me so untrustworthy professional hazard it seems watch yourself young master
huh he  he gave up too easily i dont trust him  the time has come  ive got to get out of here and rendezvous with eliwood these bags what did matthew put in these things
this is ridiculous even if he was packing for two huh   come out i know youre there
  
who are you
  
too dumb to speak makes no difference to me move out of my way or ill run you through
hah
whoa m milord stay your arm its me
who matthew i was sure you were one of them
well im not im one of me and i would prefer to remain in one piece
your fault for jumping out of nowhere now tell me what are you doing here
hm i  i sensed that something was wrong and came to your aid
my aid  ill accept that answer for the time being
so what should we do
about what
about the fellows between us and the way out id say there are 7 or 8 of them to make matters worse they seem highly competent i know youre confident in your martial abilities but  im not the strongest sword arm around and well 
if youve something to say matthew then say it
we could abandon the rear entrance im sure the royal guardsmen would be happy to aid us and 
never
thats what i thought you would say all thats left is to avoid getting killed right
you can go back if you want
in your own words milord never im with you wherever that may lead
right then lets give them a good thrashing and get out of here
fuh fuh forgive me lord nergal 
youre not marquess lauss assassins are you youre too good too professional nothing like those idiots over there
youve no need to know little lord hector a fool like you sneaking out of the country alone  youll go missing never to return your body will never be found tidy story eh ha ha 
tsk tsk  looks like your lucks run out
our luck what are you 
you see im about as angry as ive ever been i doubt that even a dozen of you could slow me down prepare to die
the ostian spy why did you return
ive known you were here for some time i also knew you were after lord hector not me youre all professional assassins you wait for your chance and you dont miss it you were waiting for me to leave lord hector alone thats when you were planning to attack right
ah  so thats why you came back is it i was sure youd gone back to play with the guards
if i had i wouldve taken lord hector with me no matter what it took
cheeky fellow arent you but youre out of your league
how so
you think to challenge me prepare to die you witless fool
ghaa 
whew  that was close glad were both all right come milord we must fly the castle guard must have heard all the noise
matthew you rogue you knew this was all going to happen didnt you
what else could i do those assassins wouldnt show themselves until you were alone
i suppose  mark my words matthew youre coming with me but from this point forward you are no longer my brothers spy you are my man now to the bitter end
yes milord shall i swear a knightly vow
to what purpose your own words will hold you well enough
true enough
let us go then to eliwood
my lord marquess its lord hector hes  
hes gone isnt he
ye  yes milord we are gathering men now to give chase
attend me we will let him go
milord
a  headstrong fool  oooh  cough cough 
lord uther are you well
   im fine it has passed there is no need for concern
you must not rely so much on physical strength alone it has been most trying these past few weeks the affairs of the court have not let you sleep you might endanger your health if you keep on 
yes oswin i understand i will speak with a physician on the morrow will that allay your fears
yes my lord i shall make the arrangements
oswin  about hector  i can entrust him to you yes
of course my lord i will guard him with my very lifes blood
/***EOF***/
all of their battles have led them here now at long last theyve finally reached the dragons gate hector gains a brief respite before the decisive battle shortly thereafter he noticed something  ninian has gone missing there her pale figure vanishes into the dark woods her gait is unsteady as though she were possessed hector quickly gives chase
 you hide and wait here theres food and water in this pack  if you ration yourselves it should last about ten days
 what about you daddy are you going away
daddy has to go to aenir  im going to get mommy
 mommy where is she
some bad men took her away they cant have gone very far though i have to go after them and save mommy you wait ten days  if daddys not back by then take your brother and go to the other side youre a clever girl you know the way right
 daddy 
daddy  dont go 
 youre good children both of you ill come for you ill be back 
  
ninian why are you running  is there something here
  this place  i feel as if i know it  its very familiar
what
lyndis is ninian well  what is it
im not sure but she said she knows this place could it have something to do with her amnesia
why would she be familiar with anything on the dread isle
 its a very old building it must have been abandoned for centuries 
what about the dragons gate were way off course now
ooh youre so insensitive this might restore ninians memory try and be a little patient
listen arent we in a bit of a hurry here while were wasting time your father could be–
its ok hector lets see what happens
hes too nice for his own good you agree with me right mark hm
hello 
you  do you live here
no im a simple traveler i was walking in the woods and became tired i was resting here this building  its been empty for a long time
really i think well take a rest here as well is that all right
yes of course
what is this place
its a ruin from the scouring  the residence of a dark sorcerer ive found several ancient tomes here fascinating stuff really if i can unlock their secrets i can move closer to the darkness from what ive gathered so far i must make further reparations
reparations
yes its the fate of those who study dark magic if you covet the dark you must enter it of your own free will you must erase yourself and become an empty vessel only then will you be able to receive the dark and master it if your disposition is weak the dark will overwhelm you you will be lost   ofttimes you will forget why you seek the power to begin with only a few people ever gain true power to win such a prize ones self is a small and insignificant sacrifice
  
ive heard rumors  bramimond one of the eight legends devoted himself entirely to the dark all emotion all memory  dissolved in a river of dark that is how he received the power to best dragons
 i dont understand why would anyone want power at the cost of his own identity
i must have it at any cost i believe every living soul has felt such desire i know i have have you not lord eliwood of pherae
what
you  it was you
uhai and aions deaths were convenient  your exhaustion is even more convenient  i teodor lay claim to the deed of killing the young noble of pherae when im done i will examine this buildings treasures at my leisure
black fog i cant see anything
blast those used to this ink will have an advantage 
ninian shes gone do you think they took ninian
lets go hector
all right that scum  no black fang must be allowed to live
i am teodor the shrike of the black fang you will die now
this is what  i spoke of if i had  more power 
that about wraps this up eliwood how about over there
fine but where is ninian has anyone seen her
i found her shes inside
hm why isnt she with you
theres a library filled with ancient books inside shes been in there staring at a picture i cant get her to move
what kind of picture
a picture of a dragon and a human
from the scouring weve got a lot of those in castle ostia
no its not a picture of the actual fighting it shows a single human and a single dragon  its a very eerie picture
 it must have belonged to the dark sorcerer who used to live here
i wonder what kind of person that magic user was 
  
ninian are you ready
yes um  im sorry for the trouble 
well did you remember something
theres  no nothing im sorry  
dont push yourself youll remember soon enough
thats right cheer up
yes 
lets get moving weve been fighting since we got here if we make it to the dragons gate we win weve got to rescue your father
right
what is this place i was supposed to be at the dragons gate why am i here ah  now i remember i was here a long long time ago  during the scouring  i studied dark magic here this  i left something here something valuable  urrgg  my head  the pain  bah it must not be worth much if i never bothered returning for it i have power now nothing else matters i will open the dragons gate and get even more power  the power to defeat anyone power

ah hector 
ursula  beyond hearing so soon    this is quite excellent quintessence i believe lord nergal will be pleased
ursula 
limste  my lady limstella i am prepared the only reward for failure is death however i must give my report to lady sonia 
that wont be necessary
urrgh
 urrg   
this is quite excellent quintessence i believe lord nergal will be pleased
 what could his majesty be thinking detaining me for so long with no just cause what no  it cant be  the prince 
co commander commander murdock you  you must come 
whats happened
my apologies for the wait the queen will see you now
very well
let us proceed
the queen of bern  even if it is a private audience courtly niceties arent my strong suit
mine either
 lets go
ah so youve returned and you were successful you recovered the fire emblem safely
 queen hellene has no one told you last night in the manse 
oh something about assassins sneaking in wasnt it ive no time for such trifles quickly the emblem
  
ah  without a doubt this is the fire emblem ha ha with this my zephiel holds rightful claim to the succession now it will never pass to that annoying guinivere  ha ha ha
queen hellene 
oh yes id forgotten your promised reward the road to the shrine of seals was it not
i have a pressing question to ask of you first what is his royal highness prince zephiel to you
i beg your pardon
his highness zephiel is your trueborn son isnt he or is he like the fire emblem nothing more than a tool for securing the throne
how dare you such insolence to whom do you think you are speaking
this has nothing to do with title you are free to possess your desires and aspirations but your own innocent son  how can you do anything that places his highnesss life at risk
what what do you mean of what do you speak 
didnt you hear us assassins nearly killed  
lyndis thats enough  i beg your leave
wait right there we are not finished someone someone stop those insolent children someone
my lady queen
murdock i thought youd been summoned to the castle by his majesty
thats correct ive only just returned one of my men told me all that happened last night theres something that i must inform you of your majesty
well thats that huh
  lord pent lady louise i ruined a perfectly good opportunity im terribly sorry
you said nothing that i did not agree with do not think long on it
lady hellene has changed before she got married she was a kind woman who wanted to be a good wife and a good mother
she and the king are ill matched she has suffered much and now she is obsessed with the succession such a sad life 
  his parents are alive yet theyre both awful i feel so sorry for him
even if it was just i should have left it unsaid i angered the queen and in doing so lost the only aid we had in bern
its over and done with no sense worrying about it now lets consider our next course of action wait whos there
go no farther
queen hellene
what are you  where are your guards
your name  it is eliwood yes take this book and this seal my reward to you
your majesty
this book contains the road to the shrine of seals the seal was a wedding present from count reglay from etruria i was saving it for zephiel but  i believe at this time that you need it more furthermore your path will remain clear for the next three days no matter what happens during that time berns soldiers will not move i can make no promises about the kings own troops though
youve done more than enough you have my heartfelt gratitude but your majesty why all of this for us
i want to thank you not as a queen but as a mother for saving my son i am forever in your debt now you should get going
 queen hellene
zephiel
mother is something amiss
you  youve endured much heartache because of me  im sorry
th thats not so
zephiel  my dear irreplaceable son from this day forward  i want us to live together as one loving family your father and i and your sister guinivere too
mother 
i am ashamed of the way i have behaved the king may not forgive me for the woman i have been yet i shall make recompense no matter the time i want to change if i speak to him from the heart someday he will understand after all we are a family
thats right he will see
so the book is a map but whats this seal
this is a heaven seal to receive something so valuable 
she really listened to you didnt she lets take them and go
she listened to us didnt she
thats right all of us
i guess 
lets make for the shrine of seals once we make it there somethings bound to happen

eliwood travels westward to meet with uther the marquess of ostia they pass through laus and continue through two more territories after a time they arrive at a fortress separating thria and ostia
the group travels west to meet with lord uther the marquess of ostia lord uther is an intelligent leader and power in the lycian league he has also been a father to hector ever since their parents died many years ago hectors reunion with his brother is a happy one if somewhat embarrassing hector continues his journey filled with complex emotions at length they arrive at a fortress that separates thria and ostia
jaffar ursula lloyd linus thats everyone is it not if i have you the four fangs together i need no one else i have need of you to eliminate a man whose living plagues me his name is eliwood a noble of pherae
  
 pheraes located in lycia is it not
thats right but he is no simple country lord he has friends other lycian lords individually they are no match for you and yet  carelessness invites death
do not make that mistake
lloyd linus  i have work for you the reed brothers as well all right
one question are these our fathers ord  i mean  the orders of the head of the black fang
hee hee  why naturally isnt that right my beloved
mmm  ah yes
there are you satisfied remove eliwood your orders come from the head of the black fang brendan reed as members of this group you will follow that order yes or does your opponent frighten you into immobility lloyd
sonia how dare you speak to my brother in such a 
linus
 i know
sonia we do not need to be chastised by you under our father we are the ones whove carried out the law of the fang if eliwood is an evil person there is no reason for us to hesitate
the fang lets none escape
we the brothers reed dispense the fangs justice
  ursula jaffar you understand your orders yes once you find the target you eliminate him at once
it will be as you say lady sonia anything for you
 ive received my orders i will do my duty
your targets name is eliwood noble of pherae bring him down on the black fangs honor
 ive heard word from my brother hes already on his way here were to wait for him
lord uther is coming here himself
so it appears i told you of this before but castle ostia not to mention the city itself is filled with countless foreign spies i assume he thinks it will be easier to speak freely here
but wouldnt leaving ostia generate even more attention
hes traveling in secret with very few attendants hes skilled at this sort of thing theres no need to worry
how unconventional it must run in the family
 and what exactly is that supposed to mean
nothing im very much looking forward to meeting him

 are you serious marquess laus abandoned us and just vanished weve no reason to engage this group
we answered marquess lauss call and we will honor our duty regardless we cannot remain in lycia any longer we rebelled against ostia and our entire mercenary force is hunted  if we take their heads we can join the black fang in bern
im opposed to this plan there are women and children in their group what you would ask of us  its something no knight  no man could do without shame
listen well heath youre a wanted man a fugitive from bern how about we take you and hand you over to berns wyvern riders we might even be knighted as a reward given honest work
  
hah thought as much everyone wants to protect his own skin now get your unit together we attack
sir were under attack its the east gate the foe is already inside
blast they would show up now
we cant move nils lets try and hold them off protect nils dont let them near him
youre tactician correct lord eliwood has told me much about you im a knight in service to house pherae my name is isadora im under your command please instruct me
shall i join the battle this time mark i cant wait ah this brings back memories doesnt it kind of like were back with lyndiss legion again ok mark guide my arrows true
lord hector well serve as your reinforcements were a small group and weve some mercenaries among us rath of sacae take charge of the mercenaries

 so youre being hunted again are you lyn of the lorca
rath rath of the kutolah well met what are you doing here
 after we parted company ive made my way as a mercenary here
i see  you havent changed at all its good to see you again
 do you need my help
are you offering
 you if you desire it
yes please lend us your strength were involved in something terribly dangerous
i see when this is finished i will end my service to this place
do you command this group
who are you
im heath a wyvern rider serving eubanss mercenaries i wish to surrender
surrender why
ive no wish to harm women and children im a soldier but  im trying to be human too
 i understand however as you know were under attack it will be hard to guarantee your safety
no thats fine i will fight alongside you
yet 
i will stop commander eubans when the moment comes  with this my lance
do you command this group
who are you to ask
im heath a wyvern rider serving eubanss mercenaries
in that case youre my enemy youre gutsy arent you prepare yourself
hold ive not come to fight you i wish to surrender to your group
surrender
ive no wish to harm women and children im a soldier but  im trying to be human too
 youre an odd one right well we could use all the help we can get youll fight under my command
understood
youre a woman
what underestimate me and youll find you die regretting it now come if youve the nerve
hold i am not here to fight you id sooner surrender
surrender youre giving up why
ive no wish to harm women and children
  i understand were no army i wont hold you prisoner if youre not going to fight go someplace where youll be safe however you are welcome to join us and fight at our side were trying to protect a sick child traveling with us
i see and i will help you protect this child
ah 
a girl  this place is dangerous you should flee quickly
  
 wait do you know the commander of these forces
ah yes 
then deliver a message for me please i am heath a wyvern rider in eubanss mercenaries tell him i want to join your group i will fight with you
wait  why
ive no wish to harm women and children
 i didnt imagine they were this capable  heh still i wont lose i live and breathe the air of war i cant be beaten
no regrets  my life and death are my own
commander eubans has gone down  uh  sound the retreat weve no more reason to fight
you are a traitor heath you know nothing of honor
i  no i simply must live a life of which i am not ashamed commander eubans  it is not too late give the order to stop if you do 
ha ha  youre so naive youre no knight and youre no mercenary either you dolt you know nothing you can carry your precious morals straight to the grave
so brother youre alive after all you were so long gone that i feared you dead another day and i might have arranged you a funeral rite
 my apologies been a little busy
yes leilas final report covered much  eliwood i am sorry about lord elbert i was powerless to help
no  nothing could have been done  more importantly do you know of nergal
only what was reported to me he appeared a year ago and seized control of the black fang then he ensnared laus in a plot of rebellion against ostia i cant see what hes after 
the dragons that vanished after the scouring  he wants to bring them back again
what can that be done
yes let me explain
this has even got my brother brooding hes always been a firm believer in quick decisions yet he wishes for more time thats never happened before
 its gone from a simple rebellion to a threat to the human race we saw it with our own eyes and yet  its all so unbelievable
yet its all true
yes i wonder what will happen next ideally we could bring the whole of our lands together to fight as one it would be a return to the time of the scouring 
however this all hinges on the existence of dragons themselves unless dragons are seen in the skies i doubt anyone will believe us
right and once the dragons are here itll be too late
we must stop all of this now and were the only ones who know enough to do it
right
i agree
there we have it come on lets speak to my brother
tactician ninian will you go with us
ye yes 
i would sooner not place this burden on your shoulders alone and yet i can see no other choice before me listen my brother  eliwood lyndis are you determined to act on your resolve
yes were prepared
me too  i dont care for sitting back waiting for others to act
and you tactician my brother and his friends are in your debt what role will you play will you help them see them through their coming trials  i see then i have no more to say i will aid you as much as i can  good luck to you all  and what of the girl the one we spoke of earlier
oh ninian
it  its an honor to meet you marquess ostia 
both ninian and her brother nils possess a special power
is that so then i would ask you do you know where nergal is at this moment
yes i can sense him  to the east  he is very far
east  is he targeting bern next
that bodes ill bern is a powerful and militant country if nergal ensnares it  were done for
 theres still time he is still  very weak   now  we must act  
so nergal cant act right away is that it yet what can we 
weve no choice but to depart for bern
 if theres time make your destination missur
missur thats the wrong direction
go to the nabata desert  you may find aid there
what do you mean
go and meet the living legend
living legend
well were going brother
 hm take care of yourself and marquess pherae too you must be eliwoods support and strength
i know this has all gotten so out of hand still its not entirely hopeless lord elberts death need not be in vain we wont lose
youre beginning to sound reasonable 
hey
what is it
your coloring you dont look so good is something wrong
 i just heard a tale that would frighten anyone when i think that the future rests on the shoulders of a man like you who lives so haphazardly i realize that my lifes been too short
bah is that any way to be and i was worried about you too
you should get going your friends are waiting
ha ha  pardon my overlong visit i will take my leave of you then most honored elder brother
hector
what is it
remember i have not given you permission to die heed the orders of your marquess and return to me alive
mm ill bring you a tale you wont believe mark my words brother i shall return

ah lord eliwood here

fargus told me to give it to you

yeah its as valuable as a heaven seal doesnt matter where we use it just so long as we use it
uh huh

 its just an old ruin
   
ah
arch sage

youre not the  archsage are you   um i  im sorry for my mistake
wa wait who in the–
 im from arcadia   i wanted to speak to   the archsage um    but hes not   here is he
no hes not
 i see     um  do you need this
its a talisman why would i need it
 we want  you all to do your best    for the future   please dont lose  if the light is strong enough  it can dispel darkness 
shes gone what a mysterious girl
i will take your life and your essence all for the sake of my master
i am not human this body and this heart are constructs yes as is this sorrow
that was a heated battle
i thought it was going to go on forever  phew 
its not finished yet nergal is waiting at the dragons gate
nergal he must pay
before we go to the dragons gate  nils if you dont mind would you share your story with us
huh
i wont force you to if you dont want to
  ok ill tell you i want you all to know about me and ninian a millennium ago  man chased dragonkind from the land exiled us we had no place to go  not on this world so we used the dragons gate to flee into another world when we passed through this chasm in space and time many of us were lost still we endured the journey we found humans there too but they were few in number we had a few skirmishes but at last we found a home we were stable there happy even but some thought back on our former home and when we did his voice reached out to us ninian was a medium in the other world an oracle of sorts she sat at the dragon shrine she held much power we were in prayer at the shrine when it happened  we heard a voice calling to us from the dragons gate it was the voice of an old friend  we knew we werent supposed to open the gate and return to this world we had no idea that the owner of that voice was nergal 
nergal 
but something unexpected happened when we opened the dragons gate and traveled her again we had lost almost all of our strength  the quintessence left within us was less even than that of an average human in order to sustain ourselves in order to breathe the air of this world we took human form we placed our energies within a dragonstone but our dragonstone was taken stolen nergal hoped to use it as a tool to summon other dragons  until we escaped we couldnt let our foolishness condemn our friends disguised as a dancer and a bard we fled and wandered from country to country thats when we first met lady lyndis one year ago
that whole time  nergal was after you why didnt you tell me
you were so good to us we didnt want to cause you any trouble after we left lyn at caelin we were captured again   we decided that the only way to escape was to cut short our own lives that was when we met lord elbert he was so strong so kind  he knew what we were and what we had done and he never once condemned us on the contrary he tried to set us at ease with stories  stories of his family of his homeland ninian and i  we listened to his stories and we grew to love his gentle wife and his son premonition  no that is too strong a word but we felt his son would be the one to save us  thats what we felt thats why  thats why lord eliwood
  
i believe in you even though ninians gone i will continue to protect you i have to that  thats ninians wish its our wish lets stop nergal youre the only one who can do it  
nils
lets do it eliwood
hes right its too early to give up i mean were still here were still alive
everyone  youre right my friends are here with me theres no power on this earth stronger than that lets go the dragons gate awaits thats where well shatter nergals ambitions

hector and his allies defeat the black fang monster pascal however they learn nothing of the fire emblems location to escape from the black fang they disguise themselves once more at eliwoods suggestion they head for the royal palace of bern
weve finally arrived i cant believe they built a palace in these mountains
bern is the only country on the continent where wyverns still fly with its wyvern riders i imagine this castle is the best defended anywhere
i agree look at the path leading up the mountains face it would be impossible to scale that in a direct assault
defenders positioned higher up would have a clear advantage even the best soldiers would be taken out with ease hm  look at that they dont have any sentries posted they must have a lot of faith in their defenses
look at these surroundings they probably make do simply with patrols within the castle the mighty bern id not like it as an enemy
and yet from this impregnable fortress a treasure was stolen perhaps the king really is responsible for all this its hard to imagine any thief cracking berns defenses
youre right but i cant imagine why the king would do this to find the fire emblem were going to need clues
listen why dont we try sneaking into the castle
thats what i was waiting for i like the way you think
whatever happens we must not be caught if it looks impossible turn around and come back here
got it
of course
this is  an inner garden
shh someones coming this way
here into this thicket
brother hello zephiel
ah guinivere have you been well
uh huh ive been fine but if you would come and see me every day id be even better much much better
every day well thats an awful lot but ill come by as often as possible all for you dear sister
yippee
guinivere guinivere where are you lass
here i am father welcome home
ah there you are were you a good girl while i was gone come give your father a kiss youre as adorable as ever
well met father
 zephiel hmph  you take the same unpleasant tone as your mother
what i  i 
silence what brings you to my castle
ah yes  murdock
yes my lord
we were hunting in the forest earlier  we found this and thought guinivere might like it
eeek a baby fox how cute its so very cute is it for me really
do you like it
yes i do thank you i do love you brother
 guinivere go play for a while
ok come on lets go you lovely little fox
 ive told you to stay away from the castle
yes i know  i beg your pardon i heard that guinivere was ill and i was worried
hah you mean you came to see if she would die dont you
father 
i beg your pardon your majesty that 
hold your tongue murdock do not forget whom you serve the king of bern
  
its all right murdock 
father i would never want to see guinivere harmed in  
you and your mother think of nothing more than stealing my throne you plague me return to the manse
 as you wish i beg your leave father
 no matter how i warn him he comes why is it that the very sight of him tries my patience so he is truly of my own flesh and blood yet 
hee hee hee it is jealousy my king
eh whos there
it is i sonia
you  well is the emblem safe
yes i have it in my possession it is all as we planned
it is unlikely but  the queen might attempt to win the emblem back are you prepared
i will not fail  it is secreted away within the black fangs fortress
keep it concealed until dusk of the tenth day then return it to me
as you will your grace
and what of my other request 
one of the four fangs will tend to it there will be no mistakes however general murdock the man protecting the prince  he is young yet well respected shall we finish him too
 murdock  his birth is low and yet his combat skills have won him the title of wyvern general it would be a great blow if bern were to lose him ill think of something to remove him from zephiels side will that do
yes it would be a great help wait   
what what is it
i sense someone
where
father brother where are you
do not worry it is my daughter
of course do not forget the black fangs role once we are successful
of course now begone quickly
farewell
zephiel this kit it  hm where is my brother
he had an errand to perform and left
oh no no no no i wanted to play
come guinivere i will play with you
no i want to play with him not you ill go and call him back here hold my fox
  attend me
yes my lord
take this beast and kill it do not let guinivere know what you do
understood
 zephiel you knave trying to steal my guiniveres love   you will learn your place
that was close  i was afraid theyd catch us
this is worse than id imagined the black fang has already reached the king
their plans for lycia failed and now theyre targeting bern
if a country as powerful as bern moves peace knows no hope
what nergal desires is powerful quintessence calling dragons back does he wish to embroil the world in chaos whatever his plans he must be stopped at any cost
right find the fire emblem and return it to the queen we do that and shell point us toward the shrine of seals
if we go to the black fang fortress 
thats our goal i must meet with everyone and seek out their fortress
i wonder if eliwood and the others are well
please ninian thats all youve spoken of since they left i understand your concern for lord eliwood but 
nils i 
you dont have to hide anything from me but you must not fall in love with him you know we are different from them
 i know but i cannot    i 
ninian where are you going
i need time to think may i be alone please
ninian 
wed better hurry and rejoin the others oh no look its a wyvern rider
shes coming closer  has she seen us
no its not us shes seen its  its nils
lets go hector
ok
ahh who who are you
light green hair crimson eyes  no mistake youre one of lord nergals lost toys yes found you at last
 what are you why cant i sense you
what happened to your bodyguards i heard they were tough i wanted to see for myself well youre here so they cant be too far away can they
 
cmon boy scream call your friends to you i grow weary of waiting i am not known for my patience
im the one youre looking for unhand the boy
youve come ive been looking forward to this
looking forward  what do you mean
the chance to crush you then hand the children over to lord nergal
nergal so youre one of his dogs are you
 ill not be called a dog by you blackheart true weve a contract with the black fang but  i am loyal to one master only he who sits on the throne of bern
then why are you in the employ of the black  
theres been far too much talking lets get started shall we ive long hungered for someone to test my strength against make this last awhile will you i want to enjoy this
listen up everyone its playtime come on out the palace has promised to stay out of this be as wild as you will
tactician our allies are hidden here and there to avoid being spotted this is not to our advantage we must gather everyone quickly
mark were all scattered about and in hiding the enemy can pick off our weaker members one by one weve got to get together and protect them
well help too tell us what to do
you as well lady louise
of course
no need for concern she is quite skilled with a bow those bern wyvern riders will be sorry to meet her
despite what you may think i shoot much better than i dance or sing i believe i can be of some small assistance
i understand thank you for your help
 now let me give you this its from lord athos
what is it
a heaven seal  it reveals hidden strengths it only works for a select few but 
it has an air of mystery to it
do you think you can use it
      no it wont work for me
wait for the proper time and have the other two try it it might not work now but im sure that you will all be able to use it at some point just keep trying
i understand thank you very much
youre tactician is that right please forget about my title and standing in my country you are our tactician and i will do as you command well then i hope well work well together
mark you are the tactician for this company are you not may our battles together be successful ones
ive heard some stories about the black fang  i hear theyve a swordfighter who wields the fearsome light brand no hes not here now but you might run into him somewhere you should be careful the light brand is a magic sword itll cut you if youre close and hurl magic at you from afar step lightly if you know hes on the battlefield
do you know anyone named mark you see i once helped out a weary traveler  who just so happened to be a brilliant tactician cared for the soldiers  won battle after battle with no casualties  ah i wonder if well meet again 
oh my its you 
me
thats right youre with them right i know that this isnt what im supposed to do but  ill not hand glory over to that newcomer vaida  what oh nothing  im talking to myself more importantly i want to give you this its a hammerne staff it repairs items it can make most items like new again promise me youll bring that wyvern riding hag down ill be seeing you again im sure hee hee 
ha ha  such a pleasant expression that settles it ill start with you
im not well     oh prince zephiel 
pah ive had it with being pushed here and there withdraw ground forces pull back and move quickly
co commander vaidas been beaten run while we still have our skins
i guess that worked out
lord eliwood
ninian nils are you both well
what shall we do lord eliwood nergals power  its returning bit by bit
what do you mean
that woman you faced  she was protected by nergals magic
her strength  it came from nergal
yes it wont be long before hes active again with all his power restored
we must hurry and gain the power to oppose him
we have to recover the fire emblem if we can do that 
come on the palace is in an uproar this is our chance to slip away
wait i have an idea lets follow them
lyndis
leave it to me i think i might be able to find the black fang fortress
this way the signs are fading but theyre really moving i think i can track them if they keep this pace
are you sure really
remember im from sacae berns foot soldiers are slow and clumsy  and to a sacaen men are easier to track than rabbits
what do you want to do eliwood
lets put our trust in lyndis if anyone can do this she can
are you serious
over here everyone
/***EOF***/
at long last lyn arrives in the land of her mothers birth lycia is a federation of territories each one ruled by a powerful marquess now lyn takes her leave of one of these territories araphen and sets out to meet her grandfather the marquess of caelin however the marquesss brother lundgren hungers to rule over caelin he is preparing a deadly welcome for lyn who stands to threaten his grasp for power
what city is this
this this is araphen after ostia its the second biggest city in lycia
the second biggest hm it does seem awfully busy by the way wheres kent
he said he was going ahead to the castle but  ah here he comes now
milady lyndis let us proceed to the castle theyve prepared supplies for us the marquess has agreed to aid us on our journey to caelin
hes going to help us
yes araphen and caelin have enjoyed a sturdy friendship for many years once i informed the marquess our plight he agreed to lend us his strength
looks like weve got a smooth road ahead
if we could pick up some soldiers the road to caelin would be that much safer im truly sorry for hardships youve suffered so far
dont be silly you are so capable kent
kent
hm oh and so are you sain
of course i am
the castle awaits 
this is terrible the castle is burning
what did you say whats happening
smoke from the castle hey what are those men doing
who are you
you youre lyndis arent you
ah what do you–
no questions prepare yourself
hey
aaaargg aaaaah
what an arrow
  
who are–
milady lyndis
are you all right
im fine he  this man saved me
may i ask your name
wait why did you help me
i thought a sacaean plainswoman was being attacked i was mistaken
no you were right i am from sacae im lyn the daughter of the lorca chieftain
the lorca there were survivors
yes
you should leave at once a blaze has started in the castle and its spreading dont be foolish and waste the life i just saved
youre from the castle whats happening how severe is the fire is the marquess safe
the castle is under attack and the marquess has been accosted the man who attacked you was probably one of the marauders as captain of the castle guard its my duty to rescue the marquess
i see  all right then well help you
milady
why
these brigands are after me if theyre attacking the castle its because of me so i must help if i can 
it sounds like youre involved somehow  lets go
youll accept our aid
i am rath of the kutolah our tribes may be different but i will not abandon a woman of the sacae
thank you rath a thousand blessings upon you
and a thousand curses upon our enemy
come
you what are you doing in my house
peace i mean no danger to you your home offers a good view of the battle outside look ill pay you for the privilege please
like a vulture waiting for the spoils eh terrible pay up ill be hiding below so dont bother me
i wouldnt dream of it
now then which side has the most to offer
once the marquess is safe my men can move in perhaps the secret passageway 
secret passageway
an underground tunnel leading to the throne room there are triggers in the barracks that will open the tunnel
head through the passage to the throne room  and rescue the marquess once thats done can you drive the enemy from the castle
mmm  if we can release those triggers my men and i can handle the rest there are three triggers though all three need to be released or the entrance wont open
but the doors to the barracks are locked
the enemys within if we dont get inside and finish them were stuck
so opening those doors is our first objective
the goal of this chapter is to open the doors and reach the 3 triggers located inside to open doors you need door keys or the services of a thief
what shall we do mark we dont have any keys with us perhaps some of the marauders are carrying keys 
there may be times when you are unsure how to proceed start by checking status on the map menu visiting homes or villages is also a good way to get information who knows what hints you might find lets try visiting a house please select lyn
what do you want me to do tell me please
wasnt i supposed to visit somewhere directions please
hey you can i talk to you
who are you
im matthew a specialist in acquisitions of all kinds would you like to buy my services
ive no need for a thief
really and how do you plan on opening the barrack doors
what how did you know about–
bullseye
  
dont be mad hire me for you ill even lower my normal rate
i do need those doors opened  ok youre hired why did you choose to ally yourself with me
hm i was watching the battle from up above your group looked like a lot more fun than the dead guy pretty simple really
youre so odd
its time to get to work
the thief matthew has joined your group thieves have picks which they use to open doors and chests picks are usable by thieves alone its time to open that door select matthew
pardon youre mark right im matthew
this is no good even im not so good i can open a door from this distance
i cant open a door i cant reach move me in front of it
the door has been opened with that you can also see inside the room behind the door within the room theres a different colored floor tile tiles that seem different in some way might be the triggers were looking for select rath move him to that tile and order him to wait triggers can be released by having allied units wait on them
you youre mark have you found the trigger if so direct me to it
i dont see any trigger there do you i didnt think so
that takes care of the first one two more to go
hey unless my eyes deceive me thats a chest say mark since we came all this way what say we help ourselves huh what do you meanno dont be such a bore if you want to win youve got to use every means at your disposal thats an ironclad rule yeah i know stealings bad im well aware of that were saving the marquess right lets just call this an advance on our reward ok
thieves can use their picks to open chests move matthew onto the chest and the chest command will appear choose this command and the contents of the chest will become yours why dont we see what we can find go ahead and select matthew
battles arent won by virtue and glory alone no ones going to miss a couple of chests relax
hey changed your mind hurrah treasure time treasure time
oh come on theres a chest right there in front of us
hey this is an angelic robe this is good for those of us on the less robust side like me for example magic items like this that increase ones abilities vanish after being used give them to the people who need them most but dont fret too much about it or youll never use them simply holding on to a useful item does no one any good
an angelic robe increases a characters max hp by a small amount select the item on the item list and use it to view more detailed information on items press the r button on the item list a thief has the skill to open doors and chests right that ability can only be utilized if the thief has a set of picks the number next to an item is the number of times the item can be used before the item breaks keep that in mind
an armorslayer just as the name suggests armorslayers are useful against knights in armor you want to know something you need to give weapons to those who can wield them otherwise its just a waste of a perfectly good weapon take this blade i mean i can use it but  im not too strong and  i just hate being counterattacked anyway think strategically about who you give weapons to
if you get a weapon or staff you cant use dont worry other members of your party might be able to wield them items you cannot use appear in gray text try trading these items to others in your group dont forget you can only trade items with one other character at a time
that takes care of the second just one more
thats the second trigger only one more
i guess that was the second trigger that leaves one more
ah  this must be the second trigger  everyone theres one more trigger
yes that was the second trigger ive got to find that last one
theres the second one  one left to find 
hm so thats the second trigger listen up just one trigger left
i guess that was the second trigger that leaves one more
thats trigger number two wheres the last one 
as i thought thats the second trigger theres only one more to go
we cant do business with all the fighting in town youre mercenaries right cant you do something huh you cant get the barracks open i bet a thief with a set of picks could open any door you needed hold on i may have something here to help you  here it is this is it one door key door keys can only be used once but anyone can use them here no charge now go get those thugs will you
so whats your weapon of choice swords lances spears or do you favor bows or magic staves whatever it may be the more you use it the more skilled you become swinging your sword about will allow you to master it eventually youll be able to wield weapons of greater power its as they say practice makes perfect you can check your skill level by pressing the r button
the captain of the marquesss guard is a fellow named rath  ive heard tell that hes a nomad from the plains of sacae odd considering how the marquess so obviously hates the nomads i guess the marquess is pleased to have a nomad under his control the ways of aristocrats are beyond my comprehension
the marquess of araphens hatred for the people of sacae is well known nomads are barred entrance to the city on the marquesss orders he says he will not allow the nomads stench to infect his city long ago the marquess was in love with marquess caelins daughter its said she spurned him in favor of a nomadic prince even so i think the marquess goes too far in his treatment of the horsemen
i feel something  i feel it someones staring at me it must be some poor fool whos smitten with me alas my beauty has rendered him speechless ah  im so cute its almost criminal
what in the world is that woman doing here i cannot let her find the passageway 
bah lyndis and her cadre when did you arrive no matter i shall deal with you
gah lord lundgren 
so this is the final one we should be good to go
the last trigger this should do it
this must be the last trigger that should do it
hey  this just might be the last trigger so i only need to 
aha found it the last trigger  well here goes 
the final trigger if i just press this 
eww is this the last trigger guess ill try moving it around
this must be the last trigger that should do it then
this is it the last trigger if i press this 
ok this is the last one this should do the trick
here it is mark the hidden passageway good work well let rath take over from here
ah its rath youve done well what a performance
sir  if you have praise it should be given to this group
hm who are you
my name is lyndis im pleased youre well
oh  its you youre marquess caelins– leave us rath i would speak with this girl
  
now  lady lyndis do you know the identity of those responsible for this uproar
i believe it to be the work of my granduncle lundgren
thats exactly right which means my castle has been damaged in your familys petty inheritance dispute
my my apologies 
when i heard that lady madelyns daughter was in trouble i thought to lend my assistance  i find ive changed my mind i withdraw my offer
marquess araphen you gave me your word my lord
  your name is kent is it not you failed to inform me of one most vital detail
what  what do you mean
this girl does resemble lady madelyn but  i didnt expect to see her so tainted with the blood of sacae
what
dont you feel the marquess of caelin would be troubled to meet this  nomadic mongrel
you–
sain hold my apologies my lord marquess
hm  your man is poorly disciplined
marquess araphen please  if you would grace us with your aid 
   i hear marquess caelin is ill and abed i question whether he will survive to meet this girl in which case his brother lundgren will claim his title and i certainly wish to avoid trouble with the coming marquess
you scheming 
sain
i understand kent sain we take our leave at once
milady lyndis we–
i am proud of the sacae blood that runs through my veins i will not accept aid from one who disparages my heritage
that was well done milady the marquess is a lout dont worry about anything were all here for you isnt that so kent
i beg your forgiveness
why are you apologizing kent
ive been so concerned with seeing you to caelin i failed to take your feelings into account
is that it trouble yourself no more you have put my safety above all else i have seen that hold your head up and be proud
milady lyndis 
bah arrogant child if she had but shed a single tear i would have granted her request we lycian nobles will never understand those prideful savages
   are those your true feelings toward the nomads of sacae milord
what oh rath i didnt see you there my comments do not reflect on you you are my captain im proud of your service
of course as long as we bend our knee to you you care not where were from but when an equal comes from my lands what conceit
rath how can you speak to me like that i have treated you well have i not i have paid you well i have treated you better than your kind deserves
you will never understand my service ends here
the marquess of araphen  he said my grandfather was ill we must hurry to caelin 
as we approach caelin lundgrens obstacles will be more difficult to overcome however ive vowed to see you through to the end milady
im counting on you kent
im with you too
thank you sain
mark  thank you for always standing at my side its because of all of you that i  i will persevere they will never break my spirit
  
rath what is it what are you–
i overheard the marquess talking to himself lyn of the lorca  proud daughter of the sacae  i would join you i would add my strength to yours
really
and this  i want you to take it
this is  gold its too much i cant accept it
i have no need for it and if it will help you 
but 
i cannot take back something once offered
rath  i thank you

general eagler has been defeated lyn and her band draw ever nearer to castle caelin within the castle walls lyns bitter enemy lundgren awaits  a man who would kill his own kin for a throne he is the source of all her troubles he must be stopped
lady lyndis you should be able to see castle caelin once we pass these mountains
grandfather  ill be with you soon
everything rests on this next battle
lundgren will not be receiving the reinforcements he expected hell move against us with everything he has soon
let him come let them all come i will not be turned away i will see my grandfather  ive come too far to let anyone stand in my way this is it mark this is our final test my friends for one last time lend me your strength
those clouds look bad its going to rain soon lets go mark we should press on while were still able
look the clouds are breaking this rain should stop soon 
its begun to rain but  the sky looks mostly clear the rain wont last long
oh no if i dont bring in the laundry now  oh hello are you a soldier sounds like a hard life  especially when it rains rain must make it difficult for you to move around i used to ride horses when i was little oh i remember how those horses disliked the rain its better to be on foot when its wet nomadic horses are trained on the plains so theyre better with rain but  well rain just seems to make it hard for everyone to get around the weather around here can change in no time at all i recommend just staying in one place until the rain clears up
youre here to fight lundgren arent you do you have enough weapons lundgrens no ordinary knight hes a general iron weapons lack the edge to penetrate his armor if you need something visit my fathers armory you should go to the shop next door to his too theyve many powerful weapons and items you can use against lundgren head south and cross the river youll see them lundgrens a tricky one hes destroyed the bridge theres an old snag next to the river though  if you knocked it over you should be able to cross travel well you fight for us all
you know you really should visit the armory next door theyve got all you need if youre fighting knights and generals you need something to defeat lundgren right once hes been beaten maybe peace will return to caelin good luck to you
youve finally made it here have you such a long way  were all behind lady lyndis all of us here take this use it in your battle against lundgren please its an energy ring itll increase your strength and magic power a bit there are lots of items that augment your abilities these are hard to come by so think carefully before you use them of course not using them at all would be a terrible waste as well right items like this might vanish once youve used them bear that in mind and use them wisely
this is my realm and youve entered without my permission you will not leave these lands alive
that annoying little girl  nothing but a savage from sacae  the caelin throne should be mine 
so youre the girl claiming kinship with my brother
youll play this farce to the end wont you lundgren
the royal house of caelin has no need of a sacaen mongrel ill put an end to this foolishness here and now
to further your own black ambitions youve harmed my grandfather and the very land you ought to serve i have neither pity nor mercy for you lundgren prepare yourself
whelp
ah one of the traitors you must be kent yes
lundgren your treachery precedes you i will not listen to any of your poisoned words
youre a fool youll wish youd never turned your coat
ah sain  youre not like that stubborn fool kent youre reasonable leave this child lyndis and stand at my side you will go far in my service
that is a gracious offer my lord 
quite 
however i am rather fond of my friend the stubborn fool and if i am to pledge my service to any liege i would choose lovely lady lyndis over foul lundgren regardless of the risk
fool i will make you regret your decision
weve won  at last i can see my grandfather

well then take care  i  i hope i see you again im sure that i will someday 
as of chapter 11 eliwood becomes the storys main character marks role will be to act as tactician aiding his group help eliwood to fulfill the chapter goals and fight his way to the end of the game youll start your first campaign with eliwood then meet his friend hector in chapter 12 and who knows you might even meet lyn again if any of these three is defeated your game will be over the game will continue if any other allied units are defeated however a defeated unit can never take part in combat again so be careful

the secrets of her past revealed in the words of two knights of lycia now to meet her grandfather lyn heads west to lycia and to her destiny a mountain range separates the sacae plains from bern there are many bandits lurking here the cruelest of which are the taliver they wreak havoc on both sacae and bern and their savagery knows no bounds on her tenth day away from the plains lyn witnesses their atrocities herself
this place  its 
the entire area is in ruins why doesnt their marquess do anything to help
taliver mountain is home to a gang of vicious ruthless bandits no marquess holds power here my village was near here on the other side of the mountain my people were  the taliver bandits came at night it took only one night the survivors numbered less than ten including me theyre soulless beasts i will never forgive them never

well i  a little 
aha you heard her she admits her fault she stepped on my friend and now shes got to pay
did you apologize florina
yes i told them i was sorry many times over they just wouldnt listen  
dont cry its alright
lyn 
listen shes obviously sorry cant we just let this pass you dont appear to be injured or anything
no chance the girl goes with us—by force if need be
hey cmon out now boys the men are fair game but dont put a scratch on the girls
tactician weve got to fight back
lyn  i 
youre a pegasus knight arent you you can fight cant you
 yes
listen carefully tactician were facing bandits theyre underlings but we cant take them too lightly lets clear them out of here are you ready
the layout around here might make it difficult to fight the same holds true for our foe too if we use these walls just so they may ensure our victory
lyn  whos that
this is tactician heshes still an apprentice but heshes my tactician
oh i see  uh tactician im pleased to meet you
oh i see  well tactician  im pleased to meet you
the red roofed buildings are villages villages are in danger of being attacked if an enemy unit reaches a village before one of our units does the village will be destroyed as quickly as possible visit the residents and give them warning only good can come of it so lets visit them please select lyn
you want me to visit a village just give me the order
im to visit a village right then issue the command
youd like me to visit a village right just give the order
is anyone there
leave us alone you thugs
go away go away weve no more gold for you
no wait please were not bandits we want to help the village please listen
remain inside everyone ill go see whats happening
not bandits huh so who are you
my name is lyn my colleagues and i are just traveling through here we saw some bandits about were going to deal with them but  we need you to go and warn the villagers
hey wait the names wil im a traveler of sorts too listen these villagers have been kind to me mind if i fight with you
not at all we need all the help we can get welcome aboard wil
by visiting a village we gained a new companion wil is an archer he uses a bow to fight bows can be fired at foes more than 1 space away obstacles wont affect your line of fire attacking enemies without moving next to them is called indirect combat if the enemy has no weapons capable of indirect combat theres no fear of counterattack and thats to our benefit however you cannot fire on adjacent spaces if someone moves next to you and attacks thats it units with bows are best suited to lend assistance from the rear lets try some indirect combat shall we select wil
so you are mark tactician i am wil master marksman no the pleasure is mine it looks like there are bandits on the other side of that wall to the east is another archer so lets go to that thug to the north hes all mine say the word tactician
hey its me wil remember why dont you issue me a command id love to help
lets take out the bandit on the north side of the wall direct me that way
next is florina a pegasus knight as you might guess pegasus knights have the ability to fly they can move over almost any terrain type this small wall would stop most units but it poses no problem for a pegasus knight select florina
so its my turn now i expect youll want me to attack that man over there well give me the order please
to the north  on the other side of the wall im to attack the other guy over there right please give me the order to attack and i shall do so
i  i am ready to fight ill follow your orders 
i wont give up please you must let me join the fight
excuse me  i hate to be a bother but  if im to attack ill need to be right next to the enemy  ill shut up now
begging your pardon  i have to be next to an enemy to attack please give me the chance to attack
knowing your units and their abilities and knowing how to use them in battle is a shortcut to victory to learn everything about a unit place the cursor on that unit and press the r button
lyn what should i do theres an archer
what where oh thats wil
hi youre one of lyns friends
um     
what  what is it are you unwell
im sorry wil her name is florina shes timid around men and you youve got a bow
oh i see you must be a pegasus knight i apologize for frightening you but i do understand your fear of bows
i um   im sorry  even looking at a bow frightens me ever so much 
of course i understand but you should really only fear the enemys archers not your own
yes of course 
units that fly like pegasus knights are very vulnerable to bow attacks arrows will deal critical damage to them if the enemy has bow wielding units you must be extremely cautious
you came to help the village thats good with so many bandits i wasnt sure what to do its not much but please take this money there is an armory to the southeast of us equip yourself as you see fit and help us please
weapons have the strength to be used only a limited number of times as you fight their endurance drops at zero the weapon breaks and disappears from your inventory check your weapon endurance by placing the cursor on a unit and pressing the r button you can also check on the item screen the number next to the weapon is its endurance be careful without a weapon a unit cannot enter combat
draw your swords were not listening to any of your stinking apologies
ugh  youll live to regret this  my brothers  the ganelon bandits will not let this stand 
hey listen theres something i wanted to ask you
begging for your life so soon wench
are you taliver bandits
taliver those greedy monsters were nothing like them those fiends will even kill women and children were from ganelon and we know a little something of honor we dont harm women for one thing heh heh heh after all why kill what you can sell
if youre not taliver then theres no reason for you to die here today if you would like to tuck your tails and flee do so now
you  you  no more courtesies youre going to learn to watch your tongue
um  excuse me 
uh its you so you changed your mind about joining us eh
well no  but this really is my fault  really  so can we 
what cmon lass out with it
im sorry can we  can we just stop fighting now
youve got to be kidding after ive been made to look like a fool no way
eeek
youre coming with us i promise you that now if you dont want to get hurt give yourself up
thats finally taken care of
lyn
florina  why did you follow me its so dangerous
do you remember the knighting ceremony of the pegasus knights of ilia
yes you join a band of freelance soldiers to further your training is that what brought you here florina
uh huh i wanted to talk to you before i set out but when i went to sacae i heard you had left with some strangers and 
you were worried for me thank you but im more worried about you
me
listen most mercenaries are men right bands of men i cant imagine you being at all comfortable around them
i know i know its just  ive always dreamt of being a pegasus knight i imagined i would just work it out somehow after today im not so sure maybe i should just give up 
florina dont cry 
yes theres no reason to give up your dream
hm
lovely florina i have the most brillant idea
sain
you should come with us with the addition of wil here were a fine group of soldiers and freelance to boot
wait did you just include me
of course we were destined to meet here its fate come now lyndiss band of mercenaries is as good a training group as youll find anywhere
sain  this is no joking matter
lyndis um lyn mercenaries
i can give you details later this is all a bit rushed however sain is right will you come with us florina
travel with you lyn truly i would be so so happy
fantastic beauteous florina i am a knight of caelin my name is sain 
eeek stay back dont get so close
ah  beautiful and yet so modest
i beg your forgiveness calling us mercenaries 
no i approve we cant leave florina on her own she requires special attention though can i count on you
yes you have but to ask
so  is it really all right if i travel with you
oh yes of course if youre willing wil
actually im very grateful truth be told all of my money was stolen and im at a bit of a crossroads i would be honored to count myself one of lyndiss legion
lyndiss legion this is getting stranger with every day tactician

jaffar and nino black fang assassins befriended by eliwood they now join his group that night 
jaffar and nino black fang assassins although hector cannot forget his hatred for nergals former henchman jaffar hector allows him to join the group with nino at his side that night 
hey
its very late where are you going
 jaffar
to sonia
 unh
do you know her whereabouts
the mountain fortress has been discovered so  i think shes in the other place
the water temple    what about them
i havent told them theyre all good people so they would know im not lying and yet  i want to see mother i want to hear the truth from her so 
nino  sentiment will not protect you from that woman
i know that but shes my mother im her flesh and blood shes the only mother i have
 that is something i cannot understand 
ah im sorry  i didnt mean 
its nothing
jaffar i truly am sorry
i will not let you go alone if you go i go with you ok
jaffar 
i wanted to know where she was slipping off to in the dead of night   nino 
  
i agree with jaffar theres no way sonia will be moved by ninos feelings
are we just going to let them go
no were going to follow them right away
of course we are
  
what are you doing hector hurry
jaffars a killer hes slaughtered our friends i cant forgive him eliwood is all this necessary do we need his strength so much that we now must rescue him
no thats not it i wanted those two to live on their lives  theyve been so hard thats why i said what i did my feelings were confirmed in bern the black fang is not all evil theyre being manipulated by nergal some of them must be fighting against their better judgment
is that what you believe about jaffar
i dont know but youve seen how he behaves around nino  he seems like a completely different person than the man we fought at the dragons gate
i feel the same way hector how about you
he has killed my friends he is my enemy no matter what happens that will never change
so youll let them die
thats not what i said i want him to stay alive he must live so that he can suffer for all hes done there satisfied
hector 
ive said my peace im done i wont do any more ranting   sorry about that now lets go hurry up you two
wha  wai wait up
lets go tactician we cant let the black fang go unattended its time we turned the tables on nergal
sonia
pah take heed how casually you call a human by name you puppet  now what do you want
eliwood is alive lord nergals orders have not yet been fulfilled
silence you abomination i know that though the four fangs are gone im still here  i will finish eliwood and his friends with my own two hands
 sonia where are you sonia
sonia i must speak  hm whos that
 oh well  i suppose its best i was done with you anyway hee hee  those annoying brothers were all that prevented me from acting sooner
sonia you 
i got close to you so that i could take control of the black fang take a look around you not a familiar face to be seen is there ive been replacing them one by one  hee hee theyre all lord nergals puppets his morphs
so youve betrayed me
youve finally noticed  youre a fool brendan reed your own sons suspected me right from the beginning every minute i spent with you every caress  it was loathsome it was all for lord nergal all to control the four fangs now its over die for me now will you die for your beloved wife
sonia you inhuman monster
aaargh  lloyd  linus  forgive your foolish father  
ow  he cant just die  has to be the black fang leader even to the bitter end
brendan reed  what magnificent essence i will deliver it to lord nergal at once
be sure to tell him that it was i who killed brendan  ooh
you appear to be injured shall i take over your duties
dont be ridiculous i will never let a creature like you seize the glory that is mine i was chosen by lord nergal himself im a perfect being
  
i will take care of eliwood and his companions i sonia
com com commander  they  theyre monsters  
uncle jan is that you uncle
nino why have you come back
i wanted to speak with mother
flee this place
uncle
the commander is dead that woman  
what were you going to say about me
mother
aaaah soniaaaa uwaa  aaaaaaaa
wretch ill smoke you out later first nino  you failed again and youve tarnished my reputation
um  mother 
shut up
ah
a thoroughly and utterly useless little girl if only id known i wouldve sent you off to your true parents
my true parents
ha ha  thats right what can the truth hurt now your true family for generations was the most famed house of magic wielders in all lycia they alone guarded the secret of the dragons thirteen years ago lord nergal and i stole that secret
my family
ha ha ha no matter how wise they were they were only human i held a child before me as a shield and they were powerless to act
  
the father the mother and then the child i carried  after they revealed all of their secrets  and i slaughtered them with these very hands
i  i  im not your daughter
there were two children a boy and a girl one the mother fought fiercely to save she held her daughter tight as i killed her that girl nino was you
no
you were still a mewling little whelp but we took you with us lord nergal thought you might be useful so he let you live i hated the very thought of it but it was lord nergals wish that i raise you as my daughter
  
we were so wrong about you stupid and useless beyond all reason a worthless piece of offal all you were was in the way
 
so thats why you wanted her dead youre inhuman your soul is black and devoid of warmth
i never expected to hear such things from you jaffar once you killed without hesitation at lord nergals command what happened to the man all feared my angel of death
nino has changed me i am no longer nergals killing engine for ninos sake  sonia you must die and i will kill you
jaffar
stay back i will take care of this woman
aha ha ha ha ha ha stay back how rich how noble so shall i pass judgment on you as the black fang must with traitors ha ha ha i sentence you to death prepare to be punished
i wont allow that
nino jaffar are you ok
bah look at the trouble youve caused
were companions now you mustnt forget that
everyone 
  
ha ha ha ha ha such sweet friends nino  sorry to cut short your little reunion ha ha  i wont let you get away to a man you will all die
hm wha   eeek
lyndis look out this way
 
ha ha ha  you are the sinners who hurt my lord nergal i will not let you die swiftly
woah this place is filling with water
the path vanished  this water prevents us from moving forward or back
nino jaffar are you all right
yeah were fine
  
ill create some paths for you so please keep coming of course you can stay where you are if you like i care not so long as you die in pain and fear you cant escape from the grave thats waiting for you though
im sorry everyone all of this its  its all my 
nino calm down i told you didnt i we came because were friends theres no need to apologize
lyn 
pathways and courtesies i guess shes being gracious right
lets defeat sonia and sever the connection between nergal and the black fang for a better future
lord nergal will have your quintessence only the chosen few will live to see the new world perfect people people like me
it cant be  im perfect  lord nergal said so 
i thought for so long that you were my true mother 
ha ha ha your mother and father looked so much like you they were so naive it made me want to vomit i dressed in rags and entered their house with a child in my arms they were sincerely concerned ha ha  trusting a stranger is so utterly foolish oh they came to regret their trust but it was too late
aaahhh youre no perfect being youre a monster in human form no mercy no forgiveness
here i come
ingrate you owe your life to lord nergal you and that girl youre nothing but filth but it matters not as long as your essence remains intact no other part of you now has any value
dear little nino
uncle jan im so glad youre safe
yes i didnt even fight i just hid  i  i  im just a cowardly old man  when that woman killed the commander i could do nothing 
father  hes dead isnt he  even though i wasnt his real daughter he treated me kindly and yet moth  sonia  
  you learned the truth
uh huh
i see  let me return this to you lass
a pendant
it belonged to your real mother the commander never fully trusted sonia he had his agents investigate her past he uncovered much  like where youd come from he was able to speak to a woman who worked in your house when he told her about you she wept with joy she asked that you be given this
  i loved the black fang nergal and sonia have ruined it but  the black fang that my father and brothers made  everyone was so kind i thought of them as my family 
mmm mmm that was a good time
uncle jan  thank you the pendant ill cherish it
take care lass  be happy
goodbye uncle see you again someday 
have you said your farewells
yes uh thanks you all came and  told me that were friends   it made me happy can i travel with you
of course right eliwood
if thats what youd like wed be happy to have you will you come and help us
yeah ill do my best i promise jaffar too
  
we should be getting back to camp weve an early start tomorrow
youre right we should head out as soon as its light the shrine of seals awaits
sonia
  lea  leave me   accursed puppet  lord nergal   aah help me
puppets have no essence to harvest you no longer have any use to lord nergal 
what  what did  what are you i am human  
  
wait  urrg  i am   hu ma

a droll merchant named merlinus now joins eliwoods group with merlinus in tow they set out for laus the following day laus is located in the heart of lycia a territory ruled by the power hungry marquess of laus lord darin preparations for the war of which the pheraen magistrate spoke the disappearance of eliwoods father elbert the death of marquess santaruz do these all revolve around lord darin in eliwoods heart the need for truth is drowned in fear a fear of what that truth may hold
are you certain pheraes heir is here
yes father weve just received word from our lookouts hes still beyond that hill but hell be here before long
lord ephidel what is the meaning of this
perhaps when they reached santaruz castle lord helman was still clinging to life
you cant be serious
he couldnt have lasted too long but maybe he told them something
thats terrible our plan its all for naught isnt it
no need to be so alarmed my lord even if he told young eliwood something of our schemes pherae no longer has any power all eliwood could do is perhaps inform marquess ostia
ostia that would be ruinous lord uther may be young and new to the throne but hes dangerous that addlepated helman he was a coward to the end to betray us now when were so close we only need a little more time to complete our plans for rebellion
then before marquess ostia becomes aware of any of this you would do well to stop them here
yes youre right of course we do have a chance they have to pass through laus to get to ostia we can still silence them
they must not pass no matter the cost
let us make haste call up our finest troops
father please let me take the command
erik tell me son can you succeed
that clod eliwood and i studied together in ostia hes a trusting fool if he sees me hell lower his guard and when he does we strike
i see
i beg your pardon  is this not too much for him if by strange chance he fell things could turn for the worse
no i know im the lads father but eriks quite clever i tell you snuffing pheraes whelp will be no trouble at all its settled its up to you now erik bring me the head of pheraes darling son
yes father i will not fail you
look around  they truly are preparing for battle marquess laus what is he scheming
 
you dont much look like you want to go to the castle
if we go and learn the truth we may have to go to war
thats fine with me
i  ive no love for war if i concentrate on the foe before me im fine if i picture families innocents caught up in our foolish politics if i imagine them  all i can do is pray for a way to solve things peacefully
eliwood 
lord eliwood a knight has ridden forth from the castle
a lone knight
yes my lord our scouts say its marquess lauss son erik he is asking to see you
erik
gah why did it have to be that buffoon
i will see him bring him here
im leaving i never could abide him ill go for a ride and survey our surroundings
good day lord hector is lord eliwood with you
no hes treating with marquess lauss son erik
is it wise for you to be away at this time
eriks a contemptuous peacock hes intolerable and he made a show of riding from the castle alone something feels odd
that is unusual ive been thinking my lord  laus is blessed with clear water and fertile ground see the shade its tall trees and grasses cast ideal for hiding soldiers dont you think
youre right oswin im going to take a look around
very good lets split up and double our ground one thing my lord
what is it
do not let yourself be distracted keep your guard up
ha ha ha yes mother i will
hello its been a long time eliwood
erik  what is your business
my business what do you mean i heard my old friend was here in laus i merely thought id ride out to greet you
  
so tell me friend what brings you to laus are you on your way to ostia
hm why would you think that
well you were always such good friends with hector he and i never  got along very well for a noble his behavior was crude and his manner of speech  you would have thought him a peasant at first glance youre still friends with hector arent you when did you see him last how do you communicate
erik  youre after something what is it
pardon
everywhere i look laus prepares for battle what are you and your father planning i will know the truth
hm  id hoped to wait until youd told me of ostia of whether youve spoken with the marquess or not
what are you talking about
hm heh heh  eliwood i have always despised you how ive longed to smash you and your pathetic morality into pieces ive dreamed of this day and here it is at last
too bad youll not live to see the end of it
hector
y you hector you couldnt  have you spoken with ostia already
maybe we have maybe we havent eliwood this mongrel has troops lying in ambush all around us laus regulars every one were in for a rough time
heh heh  theres little point in fighting youre trapped my forces will overwhelm you an unending torrent of soldiers lauss elite knights are at the ready as well heh heh  how long do you think you can survive
craven cur
hee hee hee  a world of trouble youve landed yourself in yes
who   you startled me old woman you should get out of here this is going to be a bad place to stay if you plan on living
i want to see the one searching for his father marquess pheraes son
listen up old woman youre close to death as it is quit your yammering and move on
hector you should mind your manners i am eliwood may i ask your name milady
ho ho ho what a polite young man im hannah a fortune teller i came here to help you
can you tell me where my fathers gone
no but  i can see other things useful things  i can tell you what weapons to take into battle as well as who should wield them things of that nature
i see 
dont tell me you believe any of this
i have no reason to believe or disbelieve in hannahs powers but ill not rule out anything if it helps me find my father
lord eliwood lord hector i make my living as a humble merchant if you have any items you no longer need please let poor merlinus take them
heh heh heh im here too speak to me for auguries before you engage the enemy my services are not free but they may save you from paying a greater price
uh oh i think weve been surrounded uh  but im not worried a bit im with you after all mark we make quite a team right come on mark lets get started
lord eliwood shall i join you if you deploy my tent i can help with equipment i can switch items for you and hold them if your packs are full however my tent cannot be moved about so if you deploy it it will require a guard i beg your understanding
merlinuss merchant tent can be deployed on this map if you deploy the tent any items you cannot carry can be sent to the tent however the tent is vulnerable to enemy attack if the tent loses all its hp it will vanish from the map and remain unavailable until the next map merlinuss tent gains one level for every battle it survives the tent will be harder to destroy as it increases in level
mark let me take the point there may be many of them but numbers are meaningless we are knights of pherae these mice of laus will never defeat us
hm we certainly could stand some assistance 
im sorry but its just not possible if we disobey marquess laus who knows what might happen to us
i understand well seek our aid elsewhere
youll find the same answer everywhere you go eventually youll have to do as the marquess orders you would do well to tell your employer the same thing
hm good day to you
eh whats all this looks like a wars broken out aha ha ha perfect time for a raid up and at em mates that village is ripe for plunder
priscilla has your escort returned yet
no he left yesterday in search of a way out of here  i just hope the soldiers of laus havent captured him
his search for help must have been fruitless marquess laus has ordered that no aid be given to you theres really nothing that any of us can do i apologize but 
no no you could turn me over to the marquess and yet you continue to grant me asylum im grateful for that of course if i simply went to the castle this would all be over
dont fret over that none of us are overly fond of the marquess hes always threatening us he treats us like slaves all of these war preparations we want nothing to do with them we may be divided into territories but were lycians one and all we may be invaded by another country one day but why does he want to start a war here at home none of us understand what he is doing
blast theyre stronger than i had supposed to the castle i want all the reinforcements available and i want them now
lord erik is struggling he requests reinforcements
what ready the men
unbelievable  these numbers cannot stop them
ephidel w where are you going
it seems that conquering lycia might have been too much to ask of you after all i must inform my master the black fang will be leaving at once
no you  you cant abandon us not at this stage
who was it that said ostia mustnt learn of our plans wasnt it you lord darin the marquess of laus himself
y yes it was theres no turning back for me not now p p please one more  give me one more chance i assure you i will not disappoint lord nergal
very well  assemble your men we will regroup elsewhere
eh you cant mean  my son my home  am i to abandon them
would you fall in disgrace along with your son our master lord nergal is offering you the throne of all lycia surely a few sacrifices are not too much to ask
yes  youre right my destiny is greater than this i was born to be king of lycia
and as for an heir youre still young my lord you will have time you must not let a moments sentimentality cloud your judgment
  
where are my reinforcements why havent they come ive no choice i must attack you to the castle find more men
yes my lord
ohmigosh its erk its been so long what are you doing here
oh  serra youre the last person i wanted to see 
oh thats so sweet you wanted to see me again
  
hey i know this is perfect come with us and lend a hand erk
i beg your pardon
come on ill even introduce you to lords hector and eliwood i know you youre probably just wandering about without work
no serra im afraid i am gainfully employed however  if youre fighting laus  this might work out after all
what are you babbling about make up your mind will you
my employer is hiding in a village south of here if youll help me protect her ill join up with you
lady priscilla im glad to see you well
erk have you joined lord eliwoods company as well
yes traveling with them seems to be the safest way for us to continue your search for your family
erk
oh my apologies this isnt the place to discuss such things
im sorry but 
lady priscilla my teacher entrusted you to my care until you have reached your goal i will not leave your side
thank you erk
youre battling erik and his men right let me tell you im on your side my granddaughter  marquess laus took her away he found her pretty and forced her to the castle its not much but please take this its a large sword so you have to be strong to use it its a bit unwieldy but it is a mighty weapon nonetheless i hope you can defeat the marquesss son erik it would make our lives more pleasant good luck to you
again are you another messenger from the marquess please do not waste your time i will not change my decision pardon marquess laus did not send you i  i beg your forgiveness it was my mistake say  if its not too much trouble might i leave with you im on a journey marquess laus is barring my way and im trapped i am trained in the use of staves please help me
lady priscilla are you well
i should be asking you that erk have you been wounded
im fine listen my lady ive found some friends who will help us
truly
well be joining up with marquess pheraes son traveling with them seems to be the safest way for us to continue your search for your family
erk
oh my apologies this isnt the place to discuss such things
im sorry but 
lady priscilla my teacher entrusted you to my care until you have reached your goal i will not leave your side
thank you erk
laus is the true throne of lycia taste my lance
i am no ones prisoner unhand me gwaaa
come on erik get up
you  you peasants  you cant treat a proper noble like this
its too late for niceties be thankful youre still breathing
erik you must tell me where is your father weve searched the entire castle and theres no one here
d dont be ridiculous my father would not abandon  no hed never  ephidel 
ephidel whos that
  
speak cur do you want to die here
ah
hector erik please you must tell us everything you know i  i just want to know where my father is
   ephidel  he appeared at the castle one year ago he came and my father changed ostias position had always bothered my father  he felt laus deserved to rule all of lycia but hed never gone so far as to speak of rebellion
did you say rebellion
ephidel had something  with it he convinced my father to set this plan in motion my father then sent envoys to several other marquesses marquess pherae he had approved of the idea
what
never my father would never agree to such a thing
believe or disbelieve that is your choice first was marquess santaruz then marquess pheraes reply arrived marquess pherae visited here six months ago to seal his approval
thats not  possible 
my father and yours argued vehemently that day marquess pherae always distrusted ephidel he tried to convince my father to send ephidel and the black fang assassins out of lycia my father would not be persuaded and marquess pherae left the castle as you know he then disappeared i doubt hes still alive
no
shut your mouth
eliwood said he wanted to hear everything my father  he is but ephidels puppet hell listen to anything that villain says even watch his own son die   those are the sort of people youre dealing with marquess pherae betrayed them they would not let him live ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
ah 
wait eliwood
lord hector
oswin did eliwood pass this way
lord eliwood he ran through that gate and went outside
i see
lord hector a moment please
what is it oswin
let us return to ostia the rumors  ive heard that  lord hector i cannot approve of helping eliwood or pherae any longer
what are you saying
we must think of ostias well being if marquess pherae was involved in a rebellion  
oswin you will take back those words
lord hector i appreciate your feelings 
i know eliwoods father very well im telling you that he is a man worthy of our trust you are in my service do you not feel you should follow my orders
  
heed my words oswin you are my brothers vassal your duties to guard me come second to this return to ostia oswin youve done your duty   thank you
  my remarks about marquess pherae were improper i apologize completely
oswin stop thats enough you need not bend your knee to me
my lord i would swear my service to you
service to me
please accept my lance as your own then return it with your blessings
oswin you  
i am a knight in service to castle ostia until now i have only offered my lance to lord uther yet  i now wish to offer you that same service please grant me that honor
oswin 
eliwood 
my father is alive  and  i cannot believe he supports rebellion there must be  there has to be a reason 
i know i dont believe any of this for an instant my brother trusted marquess pherae more than anyone first well find your father and uncover the truth well talk to my brother after that
hector im sorry 
dont look like that your father is surely alive right
yes of course  marquess laus  black fang assassins  now this mysterious ephidel  ill find them all and prove my fathers innocence

over here if you want to help mark i could use your advice ill protect you so stay close to me
unit information lyn is the blue unit the enemy units are red mark you are green essentially battle consists of blue  units and red  units taking turns moving on the field youre only here as a strategist mark you will only appear during special events your job as strategist is to place the cursor on blue units to issue their orders first select a unit place the cursor on lyn and press the a button

the fire emblem it has been stolen from the palace vault relying on information that he has uncovered in the city hector heads south to an area filled with lakes and marshes
you there open the cell
lady sonia bu but  the prisoner  my orders are that none may see him
open the cell  did you hear me
yes  yes
oho  arent you a lovely one i pray youll forgive the cramped quarters
pascal grentzer once and former count of berns landskron a man whose battlefield prowess was feared far and wide  until you invited your citizens to your castle and slaughtered them stripped of your title you fled the king and joined the black fang is that an accurate summary
hmmm  you know me well it would seem
you were even made one of the four fangs spending the rest of your days in this place seems so wasteful ive heard that brendan calls you “the beast” a monster who would massacre an entire village to kill one person
he doesnt know how to enjoy his work “never harm any innocents” bah “the black fang brings justice to those above the law” ha ha ha  quite droll jokes dont you think
im going to release you count ive a job for you something youll love what do you say are you interested
hmmm  why not it cant be worse than rotting here and i must say i do love my work  now tell me what is the name of my target
this is a really remote area isnt it
yeah few people call this area home
hector are you sure about this is the fire emblem really here
yes i paid a small ransom for this information theres no mistake look do you see those three run down fortresses i was told the thieves who base themselves there stole the emblem
thieves wonder if its true
well simply have to go and confirm it for ourselves
come on lets go
oh wait you two this looks  its them
its about time shall we get started
lo lord pascal are you sure shouldnt we tell the chief weve found them
you dont understand do you if we tell anyone the four fangs will take over i will not let my prey be snatched away by those spoiled children
but  but 
if you wish to be executed for desertion ill not stop you from fleeing i think it would be more fun to fight though dont you shall we proceed gentlemen
 looks like were completely surrounded
bah i dont think well lose if we fight but  these are not the most favorable conditions ok i dont care who but someone needs to break out and seize those fortresses got that we seize all three of them
oh mark
were moving out too right mark lets go florina
ok  but there are so many of them if only farina were here with us 
florina its not helping us to talk about her now now mark give us our orders
wow its started i must negotiate quickly or all the fighting will be done who looks to be in charge on this side aha there that must be the leader
i am count pascal grentzer of landskron  the man who will cut short your miserable lives
gahaa  urrg gaa  is this death is this what i have  wrought so oft before
hmmm  i heard there was a fighter whose swordwork was a terror to behold i traveled a long way to see him myself but it wasnt my brother my brothers strokes are far more lovely i would lend you my sword but im looking for someone take this it is a poor substitute but perhaps it will help you
say excuse me yes you the grim faced one
me
youre really pushing yourself taking on all these enemies
its not for pleasure hey who are you anyway youre not with those guys are you
me no im not i came out here because i heard i could make some gold what a joke only a fool would work for this piddling amount skills like mine do not some cheap
you seem pretty  sure of yourself
i am farina a mercenary attached to the strongwings ilias 3rd division of pegasus knights no doubt youve heard of me
ive heard ilian mercenaries never betray their employers so how much would it cost to hire you for ourselves
ah so youve an appreciation for true warriors after all let me see  im yours for 20000 gold
20000 gold thats laughable no sellsword is worth that much
i beg to differ your journey is a long one is it not more than one battle surely that requires a special contract special arrangements not to be morbid but there are sympathy payments to my family in the unlikely event of my death for example not to mention bonuses and hazard pay medical treatment 
hold on thats enough  your fee includes all of that right
ah so you understand im so pleased well whatll it be will you hire me
what should i do  hey mark you decide should we hire her
here it is 20000 gold youve no complaints do you
wow
what is it youll accept it right
 you surprise me you didnt even try to negotiate  just paid the gold up front who  who are you
im marquess ostias brother hector are you going to take the money or not
ah my gold of course ill take it ostias the biggest territory in all lycia isnt it pleasure doing business with you noble sir
mm im counting on you
oh and there are weapons and vulneraries too all of my current possessions are included in my fee anything new you pay for i never cover those expenses never
youve got it all figured out dont you
well if it isnt florina
farina  is it truly you
its been so long how have you been
sister ah       
hey dont start crying all over me
 but   farina   i havent seen you since you ran away from home
ran away i didnt run away
but   fiora she  she said that you werent coming home again  
well uh we  you know sisters fight sometimes i said things she said things  its in the past now
 really
really really now stop crying please so um  youre fighting with lord hector too right it looks like well be working together for a while
 uh huh
ah sister
farina you why are you here
you and florina are with lord hectors company right
yes thats right   you too
mm im getting paid a nice hefty sum i plan to see he gets his moneys worth
farina  i know its been two years but 
what oh that lets talk about it later just the two of us see you
oh farina   
thats it its finished youre not nearly good enough to trap us
we should have listened to eliwood we shouldve gone toward the palace and avoided this trap
no sense worrying about it now what we need to worry about is where we go from here
now you try and talk sense you really are something else hector
cant hold a candle to you though
what did you say
peace both of you anytime were able to weaken our foe weve done well now weve got to get out of here no telling when reinforcements might arrive
all right lets go
youre right lets hurry
/***EOF***/
with uhais dying words still sounding in their ears they venture deep into the forests heart lyn moves in utmost silence cautious not to alert any hidden enemy however following on her path a new black fang shadow appears
a great rotted tree  this would appear to be the place of which uhai spoke
so if we move west from here well reach the dragons gate right
ok lets go
hector hold a moment
what
walk quietly your armor is too noisy
oh   hows this
youre still clanking
do you see what im wearing this equipment is not light how do you propose i walk quietly in this
stop yelling at me its because of that clattering armor youre wearing im just saying we have to move cautiously nothing more
i know and im saying that im doing my best
quiet both of you armor or no if you two keep shouting like that every enemy from here to pherae itself will hear us
ah 
sorry
we must proceed with caution  i cant believe uhai was the only black fang in these woods
lord aion weve received word from the pegasus unit targets are approaching from the far side of that mountain to the east
hmph  uhai must have failed after all im not surprised were talking about the shallow wisdom of a sacaen nomad after all he possessed a certain rough talent but no mind for planning our units are in place are they not
yes
ha ha  good very good in confined spaces like this my thunder magic devastates the battle has already been won  i cannot lose combat is an equation those with intelligence have a natural advantage those imbeciles will not reach the dragons gate never i will bury them here in this forest
i can see ruins is that the dragons gate
  
ninian are you all right
 beware   the enemy comes
enemy
eliwood of pherae prepare yourself
oof we wont reach the dragons gate if we stay on the defensive hit their commander and attack the ruins
eliwood is their commander the one in the ruins
i think so it must be him
looks like hes a pretty solid magic user bah im still not confident against mages and their ilk
is that so hector perhaps you should hold back a little then
what nonsense is that i cant fight from the rear
no i just meant that sometimes its advantageous to 
why waste good breath on words when theres fighting to be done cmon
h hey hector  why do i even try
honored tactician  your name is mark correct the enemy commander is readying his troops beyond that mountain i can fly over the mountain and direct you but  getting too close could prove to be dangerous bear that in mind when you give me my orders
   
wha what the magic power of this place  the source is distorted  i i cant use any of my magic
lord aion disaster a magic seal
a magic– that good for nothing has shown his face curses  id not forseen this
who is it what are you doing there
im renault im on a pilgrimage
a bishop forgive my rudeness 
what are you doing here you dont appear to be with the black robed group i saw earlier
no we stand opposed to them  this is a battleground you should stay here your excellency this battle is nothing that need concern you
im sure that i cannot convince you to lay down your arms that being the case i give you this
this 
it may help you live longer even if you face the misery of defeat in combat you might yet find another road if you but live
thank you
may you be watched over and protected in your venture
thank you you as well your excellency
thunder thunder hear my cry
this cant be  happening 
is everyone well
yes somehow
eliwood im sorry i said things i shouldnt have
no i was shouting without thinking i was wrong forgive me
no it was my fault if i hadnt 
its no ones fault theres an eerie power here
eerie power
i dont feel it any longer but  it was meant to make us uneasy was it connected to that area where magic was nullified
now that you mention it i was so irritable  i couldnt let even the smallest thing go by without complaining  what could that have been the black fang couldnt use magic either so it wasnt an ally of theirs 
who knows
its gone now so no sense in worrying about it we should concentrate on pushing forward
hmm lets make haste to the dragons gate

hector lyndis where did those two  hnh what in blazes im  im sinking into the sand
/***EOF***/
weve received word from captain fargus if we come to badon hell give us passage to the dread isle
well then lets get going
it would be best if we outfitted ourselves before setting out we will need many supplies for a campaign on valor
and the castle town here is better stocked than badon im sure we can empty the coffers here and sell the treasures if need be
harrummph
 uh  within limits of course say 30000 gold
that seems a reasonable amount
come on ill lead the way
ostias castle town is as impressive as ever shops and items of all types imaginable
for generations our ancestors dedicated themselves to a sort of frugal militarism nobles and commoners alike shunned extravagance corrupt neither the body nor the mind they cried since the time of roland this has been the dominant ideology of ostia
i heard that when lord uther first participated in the lycian council as marquess ostia he gave a scathing indictment of the peer system now i understand his philosophy had its roots in the history of ostia itself
thats right yet this thinking  it threatens the lifestyles of many of our aristocrats so some groups view my brother with enmity i must grow wiser so that i can sit at my brothers side and aid him of course my fighting skills are not yet what they should be 
  
  
but this isnt the place for that kind of talk weve got to get going come on
yes i will go with you
 curious
what is it lyndis
hector he acts like such a brute but he takes his duties seriously
hector has always been a man of firm character ive always envied him for that his ability to conceal any doubts he feels about himself or his actions
eliwood youre more than strong enough yourself
hm
look at all thats happened in the past few months especially for you eliwood one horrible thing after another 
  
yet youre still here you didnt run away through all the battles and injuries  youve held your head high and marched on your  your strength i admire your kindness i adore
lyndis 
hey what are you two doing lets go both of you
well  i guess we should go
uh lyndis 
eliwood what are you yammering about huh are you feeling ok youre all flushed
lord hector  about last night 
dont worry about it no matter the clamor i raise my brother is dead all i can do now is try not to distract eliwood and the others i must put on a strong face must be strong for them
i see
but oswin i will not forgive you
  
not only you but my brother as well why why did you hide this from me only me am i so untrustworthy
 lord hector you may hate me and scorn me as you will but  doubting lord uthers intentions you should not do that
  
i  the last message i received from lord uther ordered that should he die i must keep that news secret from you
but why
this is what was written in lord uthers letter  he is true to his own feelings  if asked to choose between his brother and the world he would not hesitate in rushing to my side though he often speaks in anger we are brothers we are all we have i have never doubted his affection yet what if the choice were between brother and friend to choose one would mean abandoning the other he would come to despise himself whatever his choice i cannot force him to make such a decision
  
lord uther had your feelings foremost in his heart he was also considering eliwood who had lost his father  please if nothing else understand this
  
lord hector i have brought the 30000 gold that was requested from the treasury
will you look at that its an arena that is a battleground for men to test their strength come on mark we can fight to our hearts content
no leads here either  where in the world could he have gotten to ah brother of mine

after defeating the bandits lyn continues westward she and her colleagues stop for the night at a ruined fortress the ganelon bandits are in a rage after their brethren fell to lyns swords they race in pursuit of the companions their angry footsteps sound closer and closer 
ah this should suffice tonights bed
this mildewy old fortress is this the best we can do come wil surely you jest
the bandits keep everything in turmoil around here no one has time to worry about travelers and there are rather a lot of us
this will be fine who wants to be stuck inside anyway i prefer a place where i can feel the wind blow
as long as im at lyns side ill be fine
and for your protection your man at arms sain will be right here by your side ladies
sain both you and i are to remain awake we will alternate the watch
ah alas 
your pardon milady 
whos there
i forgive my intrusion my names natalie im from a village not far from here ah ow 
are you all right
hm
your leg 
its fine dont worry its from a childhood sickness i cant travel far on it but it doesnt trouble me much
what are you doing here all by yourself
im looking for my husband i heard he was in this area he said he was going to raise money to have my leg mended he left the village and hasnt returned hes a kindhearted man but i think he might be involved in something dangerous i got so worried heres a sketch of him its a poor likeness at best but his name is dorcas do you know of him
im sorry i dont believe ive seen or heard of him
i see if you do meet him please give him a message tell him that natalie is looking for him
i will tell him i promise
here they are weve finally tracked down the band that defeated migal
so theyve decided to hole up in this ruined fortress perfect well wait til it gets dark and then 
youre an idiot there are only a few of them and some are women if we attacked them at night id be a laughingstock besides we might hurt the women by mistake i will not be so wasteful
youre right carjiga youre so smart
well avenge migal and get some pretty souvenirs to boot who knows maybe ill be a leader after all ha ha ha lets go spread out and encircle the place you rogues lets finish this before it gets too dark to see
hey you your names dorcas right
 
you havent done much since you joined us if those weapons of yours arent just for show todays the day to let us see what you can do
 
i want you to attack from the back entrance to the east theres supposed to be a woman inside i want you to capture her do that and ill increase your share of the take if you want gold youll get the job done
a bunch of women huh it would break natalies sweet heart to see me sink so low
lady lyndis outside the fortress bandits
what did you say
persistent bunch arent they what do you think shall we go out and face them
no  natalie cannot move well and that would put her in danger let them come to us well fight here within these walls
mark take over the command is yours all we have to do is hold out until they tire and leave
oh 
rest easy natalie no one will harm you listen everyone fight with caution
in this chapter your goal is to protect a special character for a set period of time keep natalie safe for 7 turns  natalie and other green units are called npcs npcs are not enemies but they cannot be moved or given orders sometimes green units will be attacked because they are on the field of combat be careful not to let enemies close in on natalie
mark this fortress has two entrances thats where we must meet the enemy ill take the eastern door mark you and the others guard the main entrance
when the enemy far outnumbers your group its safer to restrict the battle to smaller areas no matter how strong an enemy is if hes attacked on all sides hes sure to take massive damage so the east door is lyns and the south door is everyone elses be on guard select lyn move her to the space indicated by the cursor and have her wait
you must move me first i need to get to the east door
the entrance to the east  i need to guard it and protect our rear
mark that man over there  doesnt he resemble the picture of natalies husband
sometimes you can speak with enemy characters if you think you can converse with someone move one of your units to an adjacent space by and large youll know whom to send from hints you receive in other conversations when youre not sure just try using lyn select lyn now
i need to talk with that man bring me to him
please tactician i need to talk to that man
you tell me are you dorcas
  how do you know my name
natalie told me what are you doing with these rogues
i need money 
that may be but joining up with mercenaries
its the only way to earn gold in these parts ill do anything even this
for gold anything would you hurt your wife natalie is here were protecting her within this fortress
what natalies  shes here
she was so worried that she came looking for you think dorcas would your actions please your wife
   youre right
well
i understand i cant do this im done with these bandits here and now
really
yes  and i would repay you for your kindness toward natalie allow me to fight for you
in this way you can sometimes turn enemies into allies never underestimate the persuasive power of speech your new companion dorcas is an axe wielding fighter do you remember the weapon triangle axes are strong against lances and weak against swords axes have more power than other weapons but they are also more difficult to hit with try using dorcas to attack select dorcas now
so youre their tactician  ill use my axes and fight alongside you direct me as you will
the weapon dorcas is using is called a handaxe use it to attack an adjacent opponent or throw it in indirect combat in the manner of a bow this versatility makes it a valuable weapon
right now after all of your units have moved it automatically becomes the enemys turn right sometimes there are moments when you might not want or be able to move all of your units when its bothersome to tell your units to wait one by one select end from the map menu to speed things up to display the map menu place the cursor on an unoccupied space and press the a button
what are you waiting for shes just a child a girl grrr get more men up here now
ah 
natalie
i wasnt strong enough   i couldnt protect natalie im sorry tactician  i need to be alone  i  i failed her when she needed help most
natalie
is it you
natalie are you all right what were you thinking coming out all this way
i was worried about you please dont let my leg trouble you anymore you mustnt put yourself in such danger please
im sorry i must have been out of my head i didnt realize  that girl lyn made me open my eyes
lyndis brought you here
ill explain later weve got to drive back these bandits first listen stay put dont move from here
all right as long as youre here i know im safe
urgh how how are they so tough you bring me more men here right away
arrgh this isnt  not me 
the enemys fled  tactician weve won
dorcas
im so sorry natalie
alls well that ends well right natalie
our village is close ill take natalie home and return tomorrow
hm why cant we just say our farewells today
well i  i spoke with tactician i  ive been invited to join your group
but were going to lycia
i have to go somewhere to earn money if you think ill be of use id like to fight for you you helped my wife  i owe you
dorcas 
please lyn we are both in agreement on this watch over my husband
things have finally calmed down
we shall take turns keeping watch please rest easily
is that all right are you sure sain
ye yes of course
let me warn you  if bandits sneak up on you they will cut you down without mercy do you understand that
what are you saying am i not a knight theres no need to worry so right kent
if theres anything suspicious i will take care of it please be assured
really well goodnight then see you tomorrow tactician
lets go
ha ha  no one trusts me 
/***EOF***/
 i name you kishuna you are the only morph to whom ive given emotions it wont suffice simply to refer to you as a number it is said man was sculpted by the hands of the gods if so then you who were sculpted by these my hands  and i whose labors gave you breath and life  what are we then what does that make us in your fabricated heart which i gave unto you what is it that you believe kishuna
oof  a rock wall  where am i  where is everyone
hello youre awake are you well
 youre from before 
hawkeyes friend
  
um  hawkeye what is this place
 i dont know
eh you dont know i would never have imagined a place such as this existed
my master never spoke of anything like this
ah lord eliwood im so glad i found you
nils is everyone all right
yes theyre nearby i cant see them but  i can sense them so they must be ok
thats good
do you know where we are i wonder how we get out of here 
id like to know too
 something strange is here i can feel it in the air
yes youre right its strange unsettling
pent doesnt that sound like 
 like a magic seal
whats that
im not entirely certain how to explain it its someone whose very presence nullifies all magic
why would this person be here why now
i have no idea all i know is that were being watched
uh oh somethings happening
ow ow ow  i really smacked my head that time eliwood lyn where are you
hello youre awake are you well
 you  youre 
hawkeyes friend
  
where in the world are we
 i dont know
huh you dont know look at this place  its terrible bleak dreadful
my master never spoke of anything like this
ah lord hector im so glad youre alive
wheres everyone else
theyre nearby i cant see them but  i can sense them so they must be ok
right thats good
do you know where we are i wonder how we get out of here
dont ask me ive never seen any place like this before
 something strange is here i can feel it in the air
yes youre right it feels thick
this strange feeling  i know it  ive felt it before back on valor
on the dread isle
mm we first felt it in some ruins near the dragons gate it was a prickly feeling that rubbed us all the wrong way then suddenly everyones magic stopped working
pent doesnt that sound like 
 like a magic seal
whats that
im not entirely certain how to explain it its someone whose very presence nullifies all magic
why would anyone like that be here why right now
i have no idea all i know is that were being watched
uh oh somethings happening
he  hes called some friends they are very powerful
he summoned them here im beginning to suspect the magic seal created this place
if we kill him can we get out of here
perhaps
then we fight if they have strength then well match their strength and challenge them we dont have time for this
i will fight too pent you stay here and guard the others
understood
select those who will go with us  and choose carefully
all right are you ready everyone try not to get separated
 dont move
ah  the wall
 hes responsible hes watching us from somewhere
  
mark is it i must see you all safely back to my master if you have need of it i will lend you my strength
the air  its returned to normal the magic seal has fled
what in the name of all that is decent is that it has human form but its  its not human
  
  
 that was a creature of heresy its existence makes a ruin of natures most basic laws
ninian
 ah lord eliwood i 
 in this world there are many mysterious things that fall beyond our realm of understanding come let us leave this place a living legend awaits us
ah  yes
  
 daughter of 
 hm
  be strong 
  ah 
 ive brought them
welcome children of roland
weve come from lycia old man do you understand
what do you mean
i think i know thousands of years ago man and dragon fought on this continent
yes mankind won and the dragons fled this world
thats correct man against dragon  that war that we know as the scouring and you know of the eight legends the heroes who led man to victory
yes weve all heard the stories of the eight legends i was raised in sacae so i know of hanon the horseman
sacae is where hanon was born our country lycia was founded by the hero roland
thats why you called us children of roland right
that is correct daughter of hanon and roland
who are you
i am athos many choose simply to call me archsage
athos it cant be 
huh what
archsage athos was one of the eight legends if you really were him old man  youd have to be over a thousand years old
the world is full of mysteries solve one and along comes another  before i knew id grown distant from my fellow man hunger  it knows no bounds
a thousand years  thats a long time
yet thanks to such longevity were meeting here today
living legend  now i see it
youre here because you want to stop nergal arent you
yes did you receive word from marquess ostia
no  i am aware of most things that occur on the continent however knowledge is not enough for me to prevent disaster
nils said something similar to that before with my special power i can sense danger coming but i cant do anything to stop it
nils  one of the children of destiny
hes here with us but something outside caught his attention
 im sure something stopped him 
hm
lets talk about nergal how do we stop him
yes what can you tell us what wisdom can you share
mm your foe is like me no longer altogether human it will be difficult to slay him through traditional means he wields a terrible power his endless strength stems from an ancient forbidden magic  to defeat him you will need a suitable response
response
 while he is resting you must find the power to oppose him
tell us what it is well do anything
it will be harder than you can imagine great trials await you  as does great despair you may regret your decision will you stay the course children
 our will remains fixed
this is a road from which you cannot turn back
weve known that all along
we can overcome anything youll see together we are strong
 very well let me tell you what you must do
have you understood all that you have heard
yes we are to seek out the shrine of seals in bern right
take hawkeye with you add his skills to your own
thank you
 and you what will you do pent and louise
nergal a magic user who rivals you lord athos  and the return of the dragons an intriguing story
 
forgive the late introductions i am pent count reglay of etruria this is louise my wife
its nice to meet you
count reglay you are count reglay
who is he someone special
yes he hails from the most prominent noble house in etruria hes known as the magic general what has brought you to this place
berns successor will soon have his coming of age ceremony pent and louise are to attend as representatives of etruria pent claimed there was time to search the desert for a magic artifact said to have been lost in the sands here long ago you arrived shortly after we did perhaps something was guiding you
bowing to the dictates of fate my wife and i would like to join you if we may
well of course thats fine right eliwood will you send word of your mission to your countrymen
theres no reason to and if we did who would believe us besides its not unusual for us to remain absent for long periods i doubt anyone will be surprised by our absence right my dear
tee hee youre right my love
not unlike a certain young noble weve heard of 
thats great thanks a lot
in any event we welcome you both with all our hearts
thank you
 theres not much time ill send you to lycia hawkeye gather everyone here in the plaza
you are tactician correct fate blows a strange wind in your direction much rides on your shoulders and in your abilities i want you to take this it enhances natural abilities skills with which one was born give this to whomever you feel will benefit the most do not waste its power holding on to it use it
everyone is here
thank you eliwood your territory is the closest to bern is it not
yes the border lies in the mountains
very good now please envision a nice wide place in pherae  next think of the name of a person you might meet there
as you say    
now children of roland it is time to say farewell you must reach the shrine of seals there your destinies doors will open wide before you
my beloved  i cannot believe you are gone every time i close my eyes i see you at my side your memory haunts me and i am filled with sorrow  elbert  if by some chance you can hear my prayer  please look after our son
mother 
what eliwood where  where are you
mother im home ive returned
ah eliwood is it really you oh how did you  you startled me so
forgive me mother the archsage sent us
you look so tired  have you lost weight oh come closer and let me see your face

im sorry mother we must hurry onward 
i know that but for one night  here in the castle  eliwood  just for tonight

yes lets do it i am so exhausted
hector lyn  thank you
hello tactician so youre still awake tactician do you know bern well no nor do i  nothing more than ive heard at court im sure that with all of your travels you know more than i by the way tactician where were you born before you met lyndis in sacae where were you if its difficult to speak about you neednt worry its just that weve been together for so long and i really know almost nothing about you if you dont mind wont you tell me about yourself i would like to learn more about you and your life

hector gains the upper hand in the battle of valor taking the lead hector moves straight toward the dragons gate before his eyes eerie ruins appear what could they be are they connected to nergal if they overlook any enemy lurking within they could be attacked from the rear without pause they open the rusty steel door and step inside 
    
more of them
there are still some morphs left so this must be nergals doing too
hey lord hector its that weird power again  like in the ruins below the desert that area where magic was nullified
a magic seal here
hector what are you talking about whats a magic seal
i dont know  i dont know too much about it
whats going on it feels different than last time in the desert its energy felt so hostile  now it feels more like  sorrow
hector theyre moving
i dont know who they are but it looks like theyre after a fight show them no mercy lets go
the barriers gone 
we beat it but what was it we saw it here once before and then under the desert was that the same creature
after that final blow its body crumbled into dust
yeah thats the same thing that happened to those morphs
so this thing  this magic seal was a morph too but it didnt look anything like the rest of them
but it was still a morph when it died  i heard its voice call out  it called out a name  nergal did you hear its voice sorrow  it was filled with a terrible sorrow
  
everybody are you ready once we get through here its on to the dragons gate and the final battle here we go time to crush nergals ambitions
