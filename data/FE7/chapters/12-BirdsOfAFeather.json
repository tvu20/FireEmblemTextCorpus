Eliwood arranges a meeting with the local ruling lord to see what he can learn.", "Hector leaves Ostia. He moves towards Santaruz to meet up with Eliwood as quickly as possible. He encounters a mysterious group whose dark garb hide an even darker secret.

Eliwood is here?"}, {"speaker": "Ephidel", "line": "Yes. He has set camp up on a hill south of here. He seeks permission to enter Santaruz.

I know not what to tell him."}, {"speaker": "Ephidel", "line": "Tell him you know nothing, and let him be on his way."}, {"speaker": "Helman", "line": "Yet... I know young Eliwood well. His father, Elbert, and I are old friends. I\u2019ve no children of my own, and I\u2019ve always treasured Eliwood... I do not believe I could look him in the eye and... I could not lie to him. I could not."}, {"speaker": "Ephidel", "line": "We\u2019ve no choice then. Let us chase the boy away. If you do not speak with him, you need tell no lies."}, {"speaker": "Helman", "line": "Wait! Do you mean to harm Eliwood?"}, {"speaker": "Ephidel", "line": "Not harm. Frighten. A scratch or two will leave no scars. He will run home to Pherae and be done with his adventure.

He\u2019s not only my father\u2019s friend. I\u2019ve known him since I was a child. I\u2019m sure that he will help us."}, {"speaker": "Marcus", "line": "What? Lord Eliwood!

I know where Lord Eliwood is. He entered Santaruz not far from here."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Is that so? We've read his movements fairly well, then.

I\u2019ve fought in many a battle in my time, I assure you. Let me tell you one thing about combat, though. The most important thing is technique. If you\u2019ve no skill, you\u2019ll rarely strike your enemy. My instructor gave me this secret book long ago. It will improve the fighting prowess of the one who reads it.

The apparent leader of that gang of thugs...He indicated that someone was watching Lord Eliwood...That someone needed him dead."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Hmm...That is troubling.

We must hurry to the castle!"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Eliwood! Who is this?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "This is Mark. I required tactical aid in the search for my father, and..."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Oh, I see. So this is who directed the battle plan back there, hm? You know, Mark, you\u2019re very young. We\u2019ve many strategists in Ostia, but none so young. Eliwood, are you sure about this one?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Mark is still a student of military strategy, but...We\u2019ve received nothing but sound advice so far.

My secret\u2019s revealed? Oh, that. Yes, it\u2019s true. My guise as a common thief was but a ruse. I\u2019ve served House Ostia for some time as a spy of sorts! Surprised? Well, regardless, it looks like we\u2019ll be traveling together again. Here\u2019s to our mutual survival!"}, {"speaker": "Serra", "line": "Eeeeeeee! Mark! Is it really you? It\u2019s been far, far too long! You missed me, didn\u2019t you? Of course you did. I knew it. Hm? Didn\u2019t I tell you before? I\u2019m in the employ of Ostia, Lycia\u2019s ruling territory. I\u2019ll be here to help you just like before! Aren\u2019t you lucky!"}]}
