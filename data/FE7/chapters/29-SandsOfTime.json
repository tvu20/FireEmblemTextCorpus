What are we supposed to do now?"}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "A moment, lad... Yes, I suppose you\u2019ve a right to know...... I first met Nergal some 500 years ago, wandering the Nabata wasteland. Like me, his only drive was the search for truth in this world. We were equals in power and knowledge, and we became fast friends. We believed we could solve the mysteries of the world. We truly believed..."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "So what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "A...disagreement, made at the height of our quest. One day, as I charted the mysteries of Nabata, I came across the most amazing village... It was unbelievable, but in that place, humans and dragons lived together in cooperation."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Dragons and humans? Are you telling me they could live together in peace?"}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "At first, I doubted what my own eyes showed me. But yes, the village truly did exist."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "That\u2019s... ...amazing."}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "The dragons that I beheld there... They were both similar to and different from the dragons I had fought hundreds of years before."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "...Ah! Eliwood...are you..."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "...... Please go on..."}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "...As you wish. They had refused to fight humans in the war, and instead, they retreated to this wasteland. They desired nothing but to remain hidden from the outside. Nergal and I crafted a barrier and created an oasis for them. Upon their invitation, we lived there with them. Our life there... It was calm and satisfying. At some point, the village became known as Arcadia, a place of perfect peace for travelers gone astray."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Arcadia..."}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "The dragons\u2019 libraries were a dream come true to us. We studied their language and history with unbridled passion. A century, then two... Time passed in an eye\u2019s blink. And yet, slowly, our thoughts turned down different paths."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "In what way?"}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "I wanted to share the dragons\u2019 wisdom with others. My hope was for our earthly paradise to spread outward."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "And Nergal?"}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "Ah, Nergal... He took the dragons\u2019 knowledge... He learned the art of stealing the essence from living creatures and turning it into power. ...It was terrible. When we discovered what he was doing, the elders and I tried to persuade him to stop. But the power bewitched him, and he was deaf to our pleas. He started with small creatures and grew ever more confident. Then, he began draining the quintessence of humans. The villagers and I joined forces and...defeated him. Or so we thought, but..."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "After he was banished from Arcadia, Nergal fled to Bern. He increased his power slowly to avoid our eye. Using quintessence, he made his puppets, the morphs. They\u2019re bewitching in form, with intellects beyond human. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve laid eyes on them yourselves. Jet black hair, pale complexion, and blood-red lips... Their most striking features are their glittering gold eyes."}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "Attack! We\u2019re under attack!"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "What!?"}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "L-Lord Hector! It\u2019s bad! An unknown group has breached the castle walls!!"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "How did they get in the castle without anyone noticing them!?"}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "They just appeared out of nowhere! The attack was so sudden, the castle guards were annihilated!"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Castle Ostia is famed far and wide as being impregnable... If it\u2019s been breached so easily, can we save it!?"}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "It\u2019s Nergal. His magic created an entrance for his thugs within the castle."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Blast! That arrogant\u2013 No matter what, the throne must be protected! I\u2019ll not let the castle fall while my brother\u2019s away!!"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Hold on, Hector!

They are his morphs..."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "It\u2019s true... They\u2019re all eerily similar. That reminds me... That man on Valor, Ephidel... Black Fang\u2019s Sonia, too... Are you saying that he made them all?"}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "It is an abomination. A crime against all that is natural. When Nergal began using morphs to carry out his plans, his power had grown beyond our ability to contain him. After humans, his next target became the essence of dragons. His next target had to be Arcadia. I concealed our paradise behind a curtain of sandstorms. I then hid in the underground ruins and waited for him. I did not hope to defeat him. Just to exchange blows... and then draw him into the desert, which would be his end."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "But Nergal never showed up, did he?"}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "Correct. I\u2019ve no idea how he managed it but... He called those siblings through the Dragon\u2019s Gate. And now... he plans to call a horde of dragons to this land."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "What do we have to do to stop him?"}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "Our last hope is the power of the legendary items. It would take too long for us to gather all of them. I will go to the Shrine of Seals and tell Bramimond everything. We must have his power, no matter the cost."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Then we should go to the Dragon\u2019s Gate ahead of you."}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "What!?"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "That\u2019s a good idea. Even though you cannot harm Nergal himself, you can certainly do some damage to his troops."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "If we don\u2019t answer Nergal\u2019s invitation soon... He\u2019ll continue to send out troops after us. If that\u2019s going to happen, we might as well take the fight to him! I won\u2019t have Lycia ravaged by any more of his acts!"}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "...You... You truly are Roland\u2019s children. I am old... I did not expect anything to surprise me again, and yet..."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "...Lord Athos."}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "It takes the strongest of bonds to alter the course of fate. Go... Go, my youthful friends. Set your sights on the Dragon\u2019s Gate and keep moving. ...Eliwood, Hector, where are the legendary items?"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "They\u2019re right here."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Mine, too. I\u2019m sorry. ...I simply couldn\u2019t bring myself to wield it."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Neither could I... Eliwood said it felt like Durandal moved by itself. A weapon with a will of its own? Can I really control a weapon like that? Frankly, I wasn\u2019t sure."}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "Let me take them from you for a while. May I?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "It\u2019s fine, but..."}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "Eliwood, Hector, I understand how you both feel. But without these weapons, we won\u2019t be able to stop Nergal. ...You know that, don\u2019t you?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "...Yes. When next I wield it, ...I won\u2019t hesitate."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Confidence is just a matter of time. I\u2019ll use it when I need to. You\u2019ll see, Graybeard!"}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "I know."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "...Oswin."}, {"speaker": "Oswin", "line": "I\u2019m here, Lord Hector. We won\u2019t be able to contact Fargus about traveling to Valor \u2019til the day after tomorrow. The guards are rotating watches to protect the castle. Lord Hector. For this one night, please get some rest."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Who needs rest!? Do not talk to me of rest when Ostia needs me! There is...something that you need to tell me, isn\u2019t there?"}, {"speaker": "Oswin", "line": "I can think of nothing, my lord."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Stop this foolishness!!

That he\u2019d gone somewhere to recover his strength. I thought that was what you were hiding...

Please......!!!"}, {"speaker": "Limstella", "line": "Welcome home, Master."}, {"speaker": "Nergal", "line": "Limstella, look at this."}, {"speaker": "Limstella", "line": "The children\u2019s dragon stone. What will you do with it?"}, {"speaker": "Nergal", "line": "I will infuse it with quintessence."}, {"speaker": "Limstella", "line": "This is..."}, {"speaker": "Nergal", "line": "The dragon girl... Ninian\u2019s essence. Beautiful... Absolutely beautiful...... With this, I will be able to call dragons whenever I please."}, {"speaker": "Limstella", "line": "Shall we begin the process right away?"}, {"speaker": "Nergal", "line": "No, I lost some quintessence from the injuries I took from Athos. To summon the numbers I need, I must have more essence. One must be fully prepared when dealing with dragons. If they wrested free from my control and killed me, all would be for naught."}, {"speaker": "Limstella", "line": "I fear to report... that the quintessence from the Black Fang has all been used. Where shall the next harvest come from?"}, {"speaker": "Nergal", "line": "Heh heh heh... All the materials we need are heading this way even now."}, {"speaker": "Limstella", "line": "...I see. Eliwood and friends."}, {"speaker": "Nergal", "line": "That\u2019s right. I will crush them, steal their essences, and call forth my dragons!! Heh heh heh... Haaa haa haha haha hah!!!"}]}
