These eight mighty generals brought peace to Elibe. The continent was divided into nations, and the people enjoyed an easy prosperity. The hero Hartmut settled in the east and founded Bern, famed for its military might. St. Elimine moved west, and her sacred name flourished among the artisans of Etruria. The horseman Hanon\u2019s legacy lived on with the nomads of his beloved plains of Sacae. The birthplace of the knight Barigan is now home to the renowned Knights of Ilia. The berserker Durban\u2019s final glory was to create a warrior\u2019s clan in the Western Isles. The archsage Athos is said to have retired to the barren wasteland of Nabata. The heirs of the champion Roland themselves became the lords of the Lycian League. Elibe has enjoyed a peace that spans 980 years\u2026", "How much longer can this peace stand before its foundations begin to crumble? Deep within the Lycian League lies Pherae, a land that has known no conflict for many generations, but which now finds itself touched by a shadow of unease. Its beloved and benevolent ruler, Lord Elbert, has mysteriously vanished\u2026 as have a number of his sworn men, loyal knights who serve at his side. A month has passed without word from the marquess. Rumors of his death abound. However, the marquess\u2019s son believes his father lives, and he has vowed to find him. Marquess Pherae\u2019s son, Eliwood: A red-haired youth who will one day become the finest knight in all of Lycia. His long journey begins here."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Marcus", "line": "Lord Eliwood, we leave on your word."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "I see.

I met Mark during the trouble in Caelin last year. A fantastic military advisor, if memory serves. If not for Mark, the marquess of Caelin and his granddaughter, Lyn, might not have survived Lundgren\u2019s uprising. What brings you to Pherae, my friend? Ha! Still traveling about, honing your skills? Of course... A worthy pursuit. Let\u2019s give thanks to providence for our chance reunion. We have need of your aid.

Are you sure?"}, {"speaker": "Elder", "line": "I would not lie, milord. My brother lived in Laus until a few days ago. His home was torched, and he had no choice but to flee here.

If you have no destination in mind, perhaps you could travel with us. Ours is a small group, with a single purpose\u2013to find my father. I do not know where our road will lead, but... We would be stronger with you in our company. You will travel with us? Splendid! Thank you! I pray we give you no cause to regret your decision."}, {"speaker": "Elder", "line": "Rebecca!
