What has brought you to this place?"}, {"speaker": "Athos", "line": "Bern's successor will soon have his coming-of-age ceremony. Pent and Louise are to attend as representatives of Etruria. Pent claimed there was time to search the desert for a magic artifact said to have been lost in the sands here long ago. You arrived shortly after we did. Perhaps something was guiding you."}, {"speaker": "Pent", "line": "Bowing to the dictates of fate, my wife and I would like to join you if we may."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Well, of course. That's fine, right, Eliwood? Will you send word of your mission to your countrymen?"}, {"speaker": "Pent", "line": "There's no reason to, and if we did, who would believe us? Besides, it's not unusual for us to remain absent for long periods. I doubt anyone will be surprised by our absence. Right, my dear?"}, {"speaker": "Louise", "line": "Tee hee. You're right, my love."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Not unlike a certain young noble we've heard of..."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "That's great!

Much rides on your shoulders and in your abilities. I want you to take this. It enhances natural abilities, skills with which one was born. Give this to whomever you feel will benefit the most.

Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Hello, Tactician. So you're still awake. Tactician, do you know Bern well? No, nor do I... Nothing more than I've heard at court. I'm sure that, with all of your travels, you know more than I. By the way, Tactician, where were you born? Before you met Lyndis in Sacae, where were you? If it's difficult to speak about, you needn't worry. It's just that we've been together for so long, and I really know almost nothing about you. If you don't mind, won't you tell me about yourself? I would like to learn more about you and your life."}]}
