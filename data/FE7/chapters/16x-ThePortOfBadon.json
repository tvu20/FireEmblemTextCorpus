We need a boat to Valor!"}, {"speaker": "Villager", "line": "You want a boat to the Dread Isle? You're mad! No way! Never! There's no one in this village who'll sail there!"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Please, we're in a hurry. Can you give us passage?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "If you won't help us, can you take us to someone who will? Please."}, {"speaker": "Villager", "line": "You must be on urgent business, that's certain. ......There may be one way..."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "What is it? Tell us, please!"}, {"speaker": "Villager", "line": "Pirates."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Eh? Pirates?"}, {"speaker": "Villager", "line": "Uh-huh. They're fearless, or as close as makes no difference, and they'll go anywhere for a fee. Who knows? They might decide to accept your mad offer."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Pirates... Looks like we've no choice."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Are you serious, Hector? Working with pirates? That's unbelievable! You're considering it, aren't you, Eliwood?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "If there's no other way, what else can we do?"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "You, too, Eliwood? I've misjudged you...

They're all the same to Lyndis. Lawbreakers and murderers."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "I see... My parents died of illness... But I can appreciate her feelings. Shall we abandon the pirate plan?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "But..."}, {"speaker": "Villager", "line": "Too bad about the girl, but there's no other way."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Let's meet the pirates. We can't decide until then."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "That's true."}, {"speaker": "Villager", "line": "That inn over there is a known favorite of the local freebooters.

Are you lads that naive? Or are you just dumb? Which is it?"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "You insolent..."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Peace, Hector!"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "If I've insulted you, I apologize. How should I address you?"}, {"speaker": "Fargus", "line": "Hmph... You don't frighten easily, do you? Well, at least it seems you're not stupid. \"Captain\" will do, whelp. I'm Fargus, captain of the Davros."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Fargus... Master Fargus? Or should I call you Captain?"}, {"speaker": "Fargus", "line": "You're not one of my mates.

Now, what do you want?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "We want to book passage to Valor."}, {"speaker": "Fargus", "line": "How much will you pay?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "We don't know the current rates.

Will you pay?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "We've no choice, but we need a little time. We'll get the gold and return as quickly as possible. Come, Hector."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Wa-Wait a moment! Eliwood!"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Eliwood! Hold on!

We don't have the money yet."}, {"speaker": "Dart", "line": "Fool! Of course you don't! I know that. The captain's got a message for you."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "A message?"}, {"speaker": "Dart", "line": "All of my mates in this village are going to attack you. If you can beat us all and get to the ship unharmed, he'll give you passage."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "For free? No gold?"}, {"speaker": "Dart", "line": "The captain's a tad off-kilter. He'd rather have a bit o' fun with you than take your gold. Smooth sailing to you."}, {"speaker": "Dart", "line": "Hey! Landlubbers! Over here! I'm over here!"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Oh, for... This is a joke, isn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Looks serious enough. Here we go!"}, {"speaker": "Dart", "line": "Listen! The captain's waiting at the docks. Talk to him and you're the winner! Trust me, though.... Don't make the mistake of attacking him! You anger the captain, and there's no turning back! Don't forget!!"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "(Comes out of a nearby house) I couldn't find a ship after all. But we have to get to that island... Looks like I'll have to endure pirates. Hm?

We need your help!"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "You're battling the pirates?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Fighting and... Look, we have to reach the docks and speak to the captain!

Still, it is a little weak against axes. Go ahead, take it. You\u2019re going to the Dread Isle, right? If you want to avoid the pirates, go behind the shop. From there, just head straight down the alley. Good luck to you."}, {"speaker": "Man", "line": "You\u2019re a brave soul to come to such a perilous place. Here. You should have this staff. You can use it to make those whose magical resistances are weaker than your own fall asleep for a while. Whether it works or not depends on the skill of the wielder. Ho, yes. Looks like those pirates are bearing down on you. Maybe this staff will help you get away."}, {"speaker": "Man", "line": "This road leads to danger. The pirates are waiting for you. Do you not think it would be better to find another route? You\u2019ve risked much to come here. I can\u2019t let you leave empty-handed. Take this axe. What do you think? Nice, isn\u2019t it? However...it\u2019s cursed. It\u2019s a mighty weapon, but if one with bad luck wields it... Ooooh! Terrible, terrible, I tell you. Don\u2019t use it unless you have to."}, {"speaker": "Woman", "line": "You\u2019re being tested by pirates, with passage to the Dread Isle hanging in the balance? Here, use this bow.

It\u2019s filled with toughs and bravados. You can get rich there... All you have to do is wager and win. If you\u2019re beaten, however, you lose both money and life. If you think you\u2019re going to lose, press the B Button to give up.
