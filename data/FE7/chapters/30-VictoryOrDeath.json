I want you all to know about me and Ninian. A millennium ago... Man chased dragonkind from the land, exiled us. We had no place to go... not on this world. So we used the Dragon's Gate to flee into another world. When we passed through this chasm in space and time, many of us were lost. Still, we endured the journey. We found humans there, too, but they were few in number. We had a few skirmishes, but at last, we found a home. We were stable there, happy, even. But some thought back on our former home, and when we did, his voice reached out to us. Ninian was a medium in the other world, an oracle of sorts. She sat at the Dragon Shrine. She held much power. We were in prayer at the shrine when it happened... We heard a voice calling to us from the Dragon's Gate. It was the voice of an old friend... We knew we weren't supposed to open the gate and return to this world. We had no idea that the owner of that voice was Nergal..."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Nergal..."}, {"speaker": "Nils", "line": "But something unexpected happened. When we opened the Dragon's Gate and traveled her again, we had lost almost all of our strength... The quintessence left within us was less even than that of an average human. In order to sustain ourselves, in order to breathe the air of this world, we took human form. We placed our energies within a dragonstone. But our dragonstone was taken...stolen. Nergal hoped to use it as a tool to summon other dragons. ...Until we escaped. We couldn't let our foolishness condemn our friends. Disguised as a dancer and a bard, we fled and wandered from country to country. That's when we first met Lady Lyndis, one year ago."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "That whole time...

After we left Lyn at Caelin, we were captured again... ...We decided that the only way to escape was to cut short our own lives. That was when we met Lord Elbert. He was so strong, so kind... He knew what we were...and what we had done, and he never once condemned us. On the contrary, he tried to set us at ease with stories... Stories of his family, of his homeland. Ninian and I... We listened to his stories, and we grew to love his gentle wife and his son. Premonition... No, that is too strong a word, but we felt his son would be the one to save us. ...That's what we felt. That's why... That's why, Lord Eliwood!"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Nils", "line": "I believe in you. Even though Ninian's gone, I will continue to protect you.
