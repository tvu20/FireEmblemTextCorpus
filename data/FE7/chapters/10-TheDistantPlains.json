Sounds like a hard life\u2026 Especially when it rains. Rain must make it difficult for you to move around. I used to ride horses when I was little. Oh, I remember how those horses disliked the rain. It\u2019s better to be on foot when it\u2019s wet. Nomadic horses are trained on the plains, so they\u2019re better with rain, but\u2026 Well, rain just seems to make it hard for everyone to get around.

Lundgren\u2019s no ordinary knight: he\u2019s a general. Iron weapons lack the edge to penetrate his armor. If you need something, visit my father\u2019s armory. You should go to the shop next door to his, too. They\u2019ve many powerful weapons and items you can use against Lundgren. Head south and cross the river. You\u2019ll see them. Lundgren\u2019s a tricky one. He\u2019s destroyed the bridge. There\u2019s an old snag next to the river, though\u2026 If you knocked it over, you should be able to cross. Travel well. You fight for us all."}, {"speaker": "Man", "line": "You know, you really should visit the armory next door. They\u2019ve got all you need if you\u2019re fighting knights and generals.

Good luck to you!"}, {"speaker": "Old Lady", "line": "You\u2019ve finally made it here, have you? Such a long way\u2026 We\u2019re all behind Lady Lyndis. All of us. Here, take this. Use it in your battle against Lundgren, please. It\u2019s an energy ring. It\u2019ll increase your strength and magic power a bit. There are lots of items that augment your abilities. These are hard to come by, so think carefully before you use them. Of course, not using them at all would be a terrible waste as well, right? Items like this might vanish once you\u2019ve used them.
