At zero, the weapon breaks and disappears from your inventory. Check your weapon endurance by placing the cursor on a unit and pressing the R Button. You can also check on the item screen.

Welcome aboard, Wil!"}, {"speaker": "Tutorial", "line": "By visiting a village, we gained a new companion. Wil is an archer. He uses a bow to fight. Bows can be fired at foes more than 1 space away. Obstacles won't affect your line of fire. Attacking enemies without moving next to them is called indirect combat. If the enemy has no weapons capable of indirect combat, there's no fear of counterattack, and that's to our benefit. However, you cannot fire on adjacent spaces. If someone moves next to you and attacks, that's it. Units with bows are best suited to lend assistance from the rear. Let's try some indirect combat, shall we? Select Wil."}], "visit": [{"speaker": "Girl", "line": "You came to help the village? That's good. With so many bandits, I wasn't sure what to do. It's not much, but please, take this money.
