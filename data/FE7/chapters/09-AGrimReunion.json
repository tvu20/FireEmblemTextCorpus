There are many benefits. With a single action, you can make your units significantly more powerful. In order to change classes, units need to be of a certain level. However, you also need a special item. For example, Wallace is carrying a knight crest. With this, cavaliers and knights can change classes. Each character class has its own unique item that allows units of that class to switch to a different class. Well then, why don\u2019t we try changing class now? Select Wallace, then choose knight crest from his items and use it."}, {"speaker": "Wallace", "line": "Mark! Let Wallace show you his might!
