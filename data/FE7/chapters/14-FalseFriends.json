That would be ruinous! Lord Uther may be young and new to the throne, but he\u2019s dangerous. That addlepated Helman! He was a coward to the end!

He and I never\u2026 got along very well. For a noble, his behavior was crude, and his manner of speech\u2026 You would have thought him a peasant at first glance.

My services are not free, but they may save you from paying a greater price!"}, {"speaker": "Serra", "line": "Uh-oh! I think we've been surrounded! Uh... but I'm not worried a bit. I'm with you after all, Mark. We make quite a team. Right. Come on, Mark! Let's get started!"}, {"speaker": "Merlinus", "line": "Lord Eliwood, shall I join you? If you deploy my tent, I can help with equipment. I can switch items for you and hold them if your packs are full. However, my tent cannot be moved about, so if you deploy it, it will require a guard. I beg your understanding."}, {"speaker": "Tutorial", "line": "Merlinus\u2019s merchant tent can be deployed on this map. If you deploy the tent, any items you cannot carry can be sent to the tent. However, the tent is vulnerable to enemy attack. If the tent loses all its HP, it will vanish from the map and remain unavailable until the next map. Merlinus\u2019s tent gains one level for every battle it survives. The tent will be harder to destroy as it increases in level."}, {"speaker": "Marcus", "line": "Mark! Let me take the point.

We certainly could stand some assistance\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Man", "line": "I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s just not possible.

You could turn me over to the marquess, and yet you continue to grant me asylum. I\u2019m grateful for that. Of course, if I simply went to the castle, this would all be over."}, {"speaker": "Man", "line": "Don\u2019t fret over that. None of us are overly fond of the marquess. He\u2019s always threatening us. He treats us like slaves. All of these war preparations? We want nothing to do with them. We may be divided into territories, but we\u2019re Lycians one and all.
