We escaped in a small boat, but I was thrown out in a storm. When I woke up, I was back on Valor. For a time, I hid in the ruins by myself. Then... I sensed something really dangerous.

I saw everything."}, {"speaker": "Ninian", "line": "...Nils."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "When we pulled Ninian from the boat, she\u2019d lost her memory.

A person of strong mind and body has hundreds of times more energy than the average person. It sounds like there aren\u2019t many people like that, though. It took too long for Nergal to find people with enough strength. Although it would take time, Nergal said the easiest way to get that much quintessence was by starting a war."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "...So he planned to make up for quality with quantity?

He said he\u2019d found the ideal source they had sought. Nergal\u2019s plans for war had been stopped, and yet... he was happy. He\u2019d taken so much energy from the knights traveling with Elbert.
