Now that word of my brother\u2019s death has spread, the throne can\u2019t be left empty forever. Being the leader of all Lycia doesn\u2019t really suit me... My brother let me play around for quite a while. If I don\u2019t grow up soon, my brother won\u2019t be able to rest. The burdens Uther carried as Marquess Ostia, his feelings for the citizenry of Ostia and all of Lycia... I\u2019ll succeed him at everything.

That\u2019s not..."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Listen, Mark. We\u2019ve got a favor to ask of you.

We would never have met were it not for you, Mark."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "If it\u2019s a boy, we\u2019re going to name him Uther, after my brother.

If it\u2019s a girl..."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Hector...Well if it isn\u2019t Mark!

You are the patron to our romance after all."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Name? We\u2019ve already decided on that. We\u2019re going to name him Uther after my brother. ...I beg your pardon? What if it\u2019s a girl? It\u2019s my child. It will be a boy! We\u2019ll pit him against Eliwood\u2019s son to see who\u2019s the strongest."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "This is all he ever talks about. Honestly, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll ever grow up. So, Mark, if it is a girl..."}, {"speaker": "Farina", "line": "Lord Hector... Oh, is that you, Mark? Wow! It\u2019s been such a long time!"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Right? But Mark\u2019s not here for long though. Some friend, eh?"}, {"speaker": "Farina", "line": "Hmm... Is that true? Oh yes, Mark! We\u2019ve a favor to ask. It may seem a little premature, but would you be our first child\u2019s godparent? I mean if you hadn\u2019t insisted, Hector might not have hired me. If you think about it, we owe everything to you, Mark."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Name? We\u2019ve already decided on that. We\u2019re going to name him Uther after my brother. ...I beg your pardon? What if it\u2019s a girl? It\u2019s my child. It will be a boy! We\u2019ll pit him against Eliwood\u2019s son to see who\u2019s the strongest."}, {"speaker": "Farina", "line": "Did you get that, Mark? I would like to have a girl, of course. Now, if we do have a girl..."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Are you leaving? Say, Mark, do you remember Athos\u2019s final words? I sealed Armads away, like it used to be, but... I can still feel its power pulsing inside me. War is coming. Someday, a terrible war... When that day comes... I want you to be there when that day comes. I want you to guide my children and me."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "We\u2019ll meet again. I\u2019m sure of it!"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Hey, Eliwood! You made it."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "I would never turn down an invitation from you. So, are you ready? You once told me being the leader of Lycia wasn\u2019t for you."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Well...yes. Now that word of my brother\u2019s death has spread, the throne can\u2019t be left empty forever. My brother let me play around for quite a while. If I don\u2019t grow up soon, he may start screaming at me from the grave."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Ha ha! You\u2019re probably right."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "The burdens Uther carried as Marquess Ostia, his feelings for the citizenry of Ostia and all of Lycia...

Well, if it isn\u2019t Eliwood!"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Well met, Lyndis. You\u2019ve grown even more fair than when I saw you last."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Oh... Did you hear that, Hector. That\u2019s the biggest difference between you and Eliwood."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Give me a break."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Hector may not say it, but more than anyone else, that is what he thinks. Isn\u2019t that so, Hector?"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Really?"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Eliwood! You..."}, {"speaker": "Farina", "line": "Lord Hector... Hm? Is that you, Lord Eliwood? Wah! It\u2019s been such a very long time!"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Nice to see you again, Farina. We didn\u2019t have too many chances to talk during our journey, but..."}, {"speaker": "Farina", "line": "That\u2019s true."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Well, you\u2019ll have plenty of opportunity from now on. Let me introduce you... This here\u2019s the 20,000 gold woman."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Huh?"}, {"speaker": "Farina", "line": "Hold it! Are you still angry about that? That was a reasonable sum, and it included hazard pay!"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Hm?"}, {"speaker": "Florina", "line": "Lord Hector... Ah... Lord Eliwood... It\u2019s, um, nice to see you again."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Hello, Florina. Have you grown used to life here in Ostia?"}, {"speaker": "Florina", "line": "Yes, yes..."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Truly? You still get tongue-tied in front of crowds."}, {"speaker": "Florina", "line": "Ye-Yes..."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "As the wife of Marquess Ostia, you must be able to speak in public. That has me somewhat worried."}, {"speaker": "Florina", "line": "I-I\u2019m sorry... I\u2019ll...do...better... Sniff..."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "OK! OK! I understand, so don\u2019t cry! It\u2019s all my fault! Please!"}, {"speaker": "Florina", "line": "OK..."}, {"speaker": "Oswin", "line": "I beg your pardon. Lord Hector, shall we?"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Yeah, OK. Say, Eliwood, do you remember old Athos Graybeard\u2019s final words?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Of course."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "I sealed Armads away, like it used to be, but... I can still feel its power pulsing inside me. War is coming. Someday, a terrible war... When that day comes..."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Mm, I understand. When it comes, we\u2019ll fight together. For our future and for our children\u2019s."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Thanks for coming, Eliwood!"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Hector! Long time, no see!"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "First time since my brother's funeral--fifteen years now. And look at us. We've both grown older, haven't we?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Uh-huh. Time certainly does speed right by. My father's disappearance...his death...the fight with Nergal...those fire dragons... The memories are so vivid, it might have happened yesterday."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Nergal... What a blackheart he was. I've had enough of battles like that. Hm? Is that your son over there?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "I've been wanting to introduce you, but there's been no chance. Roy! Come here!"}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Did you need something, Father?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Say hello to Marquess Ostia!"}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Ye-Yes, sir! A pleasure to meet you, Lord Hector. My name is Roy."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Roy, is it? Nice to meet you, lad. Well, I guess that means I should introduce my daughter then! Lilina!"}, {"speaker": "Lilina", "line": "......."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "What? Are you being shy? You don't have to be nervous. This is your father's old friend and his son."}, {"speaker": "Lilina", "line": "......."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Hello, Lilina. This is Roy. He's the same age as you."}, {"speaker": "Lilina", "line": "Nice to meet you..."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Lilina? Let's be friends. We can play over there."}, {"speaker": "Lilina", "line": "......."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "It's OK. Go on."}, {"speaker": "Lilina", "line": "Ah!"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "What a cute child. Good thing she took after her mother."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "What? She looks just like me, doesn't she?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "You're a sarcastic one, Marquess Ostia!"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Come on, now you're the one putting on airs, Marquess Pherae!"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Ha ha ha ha! The only thing older about you is your appearance. Don't tell me you still behave like that even now that you're the marquess!"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "I'm always on top of my duties as marquess. But when I'm around you, I want to relax, so, please..."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Hector... By the way, I heard that the king of Bern died. It was fairly sudden, too."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "I can't be certain, but according to one of our spies, he was killed in an assassination attempt on Prince Zephiel."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "The prince? I trust he was unharmed."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "It's a strange tale... At first, I'd heard that the prince was killed. Then new information came three days later saying that it was the king who had died."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Do you remember Archsage Athos's prediction? Is something happening in Bern?"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "I don't know."}, {"speaker": "Lilina", "line": "Father! Can I show Roy my pony?"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Yes, go ahead. Be careful!"}, {"speaker": "Lilina", "line": "OK!"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "For the sake of our children's futures, I'll stop anything that may happen. I'll sacrifice my life to make it so."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "\"Once again, Lycia brings hope.\" ...If that turns out to be wrong? No. It must happen..."}, {"speaker": "Enigmatic Man", "line": "For what reason have you awakened a demon dragon?"}, {"speaker": "Zephiel", "line": "Who are you?"}, {"speaker": "Enigmatic Man", "line": "...Dragon."}]}
