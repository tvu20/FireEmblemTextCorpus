This would appear to be the place of which Uhai spoke."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "So if we move west from here, we\u2019ll reach the Dragon\u2019s Gate, right?"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "OK, let\u2019s go!"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Hector, hold a moment."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "What?"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Walk quietly. Your armor is too noisy."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Oh! ... How\u2019s this?"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "You\u2019re still clanking."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Do you see what I\u2019m wearing? This equipment is not light! How do you propose I walk quietly in this!?"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Stop yelling at me! It\u2019s because of that clattering armor you\u2019re wearing! I\u2019m just saying we have to move cautiously. Nothing more!"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "I know! And I\u2019m saying that I\u2019m doing my best!"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Quiet, both of you! Armor or no, if you two keep shouting like that, every enemy from here to Pherae itself will hear us!"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Ah..."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Sorry."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "We must proceed with caution.  I can\u2019t believe Uhai was the only Black Fang in these woods."}, {"speaker": "Black Fang", "line": "Lord Aion, we\u2019ve received word from the pegasus unit. Targets are approaching from the far side of that mountain to the east."}, {"speaker": "Aion", "line": "Hmph... Uhai must have failed after all. I\u2019m not surprised. We\u2019re talking about the shallow wisdom of a Sacaen nomad, after all. He possessed a certain rough talent, but no mind for planning. Our units are in place, are they not?"}, {"speaker": "Black Fang", "line": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Aion", "line": "Ha ha... Good. Very good. In confined spaces like this, my thunder magic devastates. The battle has already been won... I cannot lose. Combat is an equation. Those with intelligence have a natural advantage. Those imbeciles will not reach the Dragon\u2019s Gate. Never. I will bury them here in this forest!"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "I can see ruins. Is that the Dragon\u2019s Gate?"}, {"speaker": "Ninian", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Ninian? Are you all right?"}, {"speaker": "Ninian", "line": "...Beware! ......The enemy comes!"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Enemy?"}, {"speaker": "Shaman", "line": "Eliwood of Pherae! Prepare yourself!"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Oof!! We won\u2019t reach the Dragon\u2019s Gate if we stay on the defensive. Hit their commander, and attack the ruins!"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Eliwood. Is their commander the one in the ruins?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "I think so. It must be him."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Looks like he\u2019s a pretty solid magic user. Bah, I\u2019m still not confident against mages and their ilk."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Is that so, Hector? Perhaps you should hold back a little then."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "What nonsense is that? I can\u2019t fight from the rear!"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "No, I just meant that sometimes it\u2019s advantageous to..."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Why waste good breath on words when there\u2019s fighting to be done! C\u2019mon!"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "H-Hey! Hector!! ...Why do I even try?!"}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Fiora", "line": "Honored tactician... Your name is Mark, correct? The enemy commander is readying his troops beyond that mountain. I can fly over the mountain and direct you, but... Getting too close could prove to be dangerous.

I...I can\u2019t use any of my magic!"}, {"speaker": "Black Fang", "line": "Lord Aion! Disaster! A magic seal!"}, {"speaker": "Aion", "line": "A magic\u2013 That good-for-nothing has shown his face?!

You don\u2019t appear to be with the black-robed group I saw earlier."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "No, we stand opposed to them. ...This is a battleground. You should stay here, Your Excellency. This battle is nothing that need concern you."}, {"speaker": "Renault", "line": "I\u2019m sure that I cannot convince you to lay down your arms. That being the case, I give you this."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "This..."}, {"speaker": "Renault", "line": "It may help you live longer. Even if you face the misery of defeat in combat, you might yet find another road if you but live."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Renault", "line": "May you be watched over and protected in your venture."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Thank you.

I said things I shouldn\u2019t have."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "No, I was shouting without thinking. I was wrong. Forgive me."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "No, it was my fault. If I hadn\u2019t..."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault. There\u2019s an eerie power here."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Eerie power?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "I don\u2019t feel it any longer, but... It was meant to make us uneasy. Was it connected to that area where magic was nullified?"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Now that you mention it, I was so irritable... I couldn\u2019t let even the smallest thing go by without complaining. ...What could that have been? The Black Fang couldn\u2019t use magic either. So it wasn\u2019t an ally of theirs..."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Who knows?"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "It\u2019s gone now, so no sense in worrying about it. We should concentrate on pushing forward."}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Hmm. Let\u2019s make haste to the Dragon\u2019s Gate."}]}
