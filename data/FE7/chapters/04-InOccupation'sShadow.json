He said he was going to raise money to have my leg mended. He left the village and hasn\u2019t returned. He\u2019s a kindhearted man, but I think he might be involved in something dangerous. I got so worried...Here\u2019s a sketch of him. It\u2019s a poor likeness at best, but...His name is Dorcas. Do you know of him?"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "I\u2019m sorry.

We\u2019ve finally tracked down the band that defeated Migal."}, {"speaker": "Ratface", "line": "So they\u2019ve decided to hole up in this ruined fortress. Perfect. We\u2019ll wait \u2019til it gets dark, and then..."}, {"speaker": "Carjiga", "line": "You\u2019re an idiot! There are only a few of them, and some are women!

You\u2019re so smart!"}, {"speaker": "Carjiga", "line": "We\u2019ll avenge Migal and get some pretty souvenirs to boot. Who knows, maybe I\u2019ll be a leader after all. Ha ha ha! Let\u2019s go! Spread out and encircle the place, you rogues! Let\u2019s finish this before it gets too dark to see!"}, {"speaker": "Carjiga", "line": "Hey, you! Your name\u2019s...Dorcas, right?"}, {"speaker": "Dorcas", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Carjiga", "line": "You haven\u2019t done much since you joined us.
