I think she's in the other place."}, {"speaker": "Jaffar", "line": "The Water Temple? ...... What about them?"}, {"speaker": "Nino", "line": "I haven't told them. They're all good people, so they would know I'm not lying. And yet... I want to see Mother. I want to hear the truth from her. So..."}, {"speaker": "Jaffar", "line": "Nino... Sentiment will not protect you from that woman."}, {"speaker": "Nino", "line": "I know that! But she's my mother!! I'm her flesh and blood.

Hurry!"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Jaffar's a killer. He's slaughtered our friends. I can't forgive him. Eliwood, is all this necessary? Do we need his strength so much that we now must rescue him?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "No, that's not it. I wanted those two to live on. Their lives... They've been so hard. That's why I said what I did. My feelings were confirmed in Bern. The Black Fang is not all evil. They're being manipulated by Nergal. Some of them must be fighting against their better judgment."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Is that what you believe about Jaffar?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "I don't know.

Hector, how about you?"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "He has killed my friends. He is my enemy. No matter what happens, that will never change."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "So you'll let them die?"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "That's not what I said! I want him to stay alive.

His morphs!!"}, {"speaker": "Brendan", "line": "So...you've betrayed me."}, {"speaker": "Sonia", "line": "You've finally noticed... You're a fool, Brendan Reed!

Die for me now, will you? Die for your beloved wife!"}, {"speaker": "Brendan", "line": "Sonia! You inhuman monster!!!"}, {"speaker": "Brendan", "line": "Aaargh... Lloyd... Linus... Forgive your...foolish...father......"}, {"speaker": "Sonia", "line": "Ow... He can't just die... Has to be the Black Fang leader even to the bitter end."}, {"speaker": "Limstella", "line": "Brendan Reed... What magnificent essence. I will deliver it to Lord Nergal at once."}, {"speaker": "Sonia", "line": "Be sure to tell him that it was I who killed Brendan!! ...Ooh!"}, {"speaker": "Limstella", "line": "You appear to be injured. Shall I take over your duties?"}, {"speaker": "Sonia", "line": "Don't be ridiculous! I will never let a creature like you seize the glory that is mine! I was chosen by Lord Nergal himself!

Mother..."}, {"speaker": "Sonia", "line": "Shut up!!"}, {"speaker": "Nino", "line": "Ah!"}, {"speaker": "Sonia", "line": "A thoroughly and utterly useless little girl. If only I'd known, I would've sent you off to your true parents!"}, {"speaker": "Nino", "line": "My true...parents?"}, {"speaker": "Sonia", "line": "Ha ha... That's right. What can the truth hurt now? Your true family for generations was the most famed house of magic wielders in all Lycia. They alone guarded the secret of the dragons. Thirteen years ago, Lord Nergal and I stole that secret."}, {"speaker": "Nino", "line": "My...family?"}, {"speaker": "Sonia", "line": "Ha ha ha! No matter how wise they were, they were only human. I held a child before me as a shield, and they were powerless to act!"}, {"speaker": "Nino", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Sonia", "line": "The father, the mother, and then the child I carried... After they revealed all of their secrets... And I slaughtered them with these very hands!!"}, {"speaker": "Nino", "line": "I... I... I'm not your daughter?"}, {"speaker": "Sonia", "line": "There were two children, a boy and a girl. One, the mother fought fiercely to save. She held her daughter tight as I killed her. That girl, Nino, was you!"}, {"speaker": "Nino", "line": "No!"}, {"speaker": "Sonia", "line": "You were still a mewling little whelp, but we took you with us.

I hated the very thought of it, but it was Lord Nergal's wish that I raise you as my daughter."}, {"speaker": "Nino", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Sonia", "line": "We were so wrong about you! Stupid and useless beyond all reason! A worthless piece of offal! All you were was in the way!"}, {"speaker": "Nino", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Jaffar", "line": "So that's why you wanted her dead. You're inhuman. Your soul is black and devoid of warmth."}, {"speaker": "Sonia", "line": "I never expected to hear such things from you, Jaffar! Once, you killed without hesitation at Lord Nergal's command. What happened to the man all feared, my Angel of Death?"}, {"speaker": "Jaffar", "line": "Nino has changed me. I am no longer Nergal's killing engine. For Nino's sake... Sonia, you must die. And I will kill you!"}, {"speaker": "Nino", "line": "Jaffar!!"}, {"speaker": "Jaffar", "line": "Stay back. I will take care of this woman."}, {"speaker": "Sonia", "line": "Aha ha ha ha ha ha!!! \"Stay back\"! How rich! How noble! So, shall I pass judgment on you, as the Black Fang must with traitors? Ha ha ha! I sentence you to death! Prepare to be punished!"}, {"speaker": "???", "line": "I won't allow that!!"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Nino! Jaffar!

Sorry to cut short your little reunion. Ha ha... I won't let you get away. To a man, you will all die!"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Hm? Wha--!? Eeek!"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "Lyndis! Look out!! This way!"}, {"speaker": "Jaffar", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Sonia", "line": "Ha ha ha... You are the sinners who hurt my Lord Nergal.
