Mark, will you help me again?"}, {"speaker": "Darin", "line": "Ri\u2026Ridiculous\u2026 Even Bauker?"}, {"speaker": "Hausen", "line": "Lord Darin, it\u2019s time to give up this madness. Further resistance is meaningless. For what you\u2019ve done, you may never be forgiven, but it\u2019s not too late to try. Tell Eliwood everything. He\u2019ll intervene with Marquess Ostia on your behalf\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Darin", "line": "I\u2026I\u2019ve\u2026lost\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Hausen", "line": "Hurry! Eliwood will be here in no time. Let me speak for you. Gurr\u2026 Guaaaa!!"}, {"speaker": "Ephidel", "line": "None of that now. Marquess Laus needs no troublesome advice."}, {"speaker": "Darin", "line": "L-Lord Ephidel?"}, {"speaker": "Ephidel", "line": "There is no turning back for you now. You should know that. First, Marquess Santaruz\u2026 and now Marquess Caelin. Both deaths are on your head."}, {"speaker": "Darin", "line": "What? It was by your hand that they both died! I-I never asked for this."}, {"speaker": "Ephidel", "line": "Yes, I killed them\u2026 for you."}, {"speaker": "Darin", "line": "To\u2026trap me?"}, {"speaker": "Ephidel", "line": "Don\u2019t be absurd. I follow my master\u2019s orders. My only wish is to deliver your dreams to you. The crown of a united Lycia\u2026. And once that is done, dominion over the entire continent. Is that not what you desire?"}, {"speaker": "Darin", "line": "\u2026 \u2026 \u2026Yes\u2026Yes, of course. That dream IS still worth a few sacrifices, isn\u2019t it?"}, {"speaker": "Ephidel", "line": "You\u2019re exactly right. Our plans may have gone drastically awry, but as long as we have the master\u2019s power behind us, we cannot be defeated. We\u2019d do well to leave now, before those meddlesome worms arrive. You will leave everyone from Laus behind. We will use them to delay our foe."}, {"speaker": "Darin", "line": "Everyone\u2026 My soldiers? But\u2026who will protect me?"}, {"speaker": "Ephidel", "line": "The Black Fang and I will more than suffice for that task. There is nothing else you need, I assure you."}, {"speaker": "Darin", "line": "Yes\u2026I\u2026I see that now. Where do we go from here?"}, {"speaker": "Ephidel", "line": "To the Dragon\u2019s Gate\u2026 Our master awaits us there. The master has informed me our hostage may be all we need. If all goes well, we may be able to perform the ceremony with him alone."}, {"speaker": "Darin", "line": "Oh! Is that so? I suppose we\u2019ve nothing to worry about."}, {"speaker": "Ephidel", "line": "That is correct. Now please, begin your retreat. I have two or three orders to give, then I will be right behind you."}, {"speaker": "Ephidel", "line": "Pathetic imbecile\u2026 Leila? Where are you?"}, {"speaker": "Leila", "line": "I\u2019m here."}, {"speaker": "Ephidel", "line": "While Eliwood is occupied, finish off Marquess Caelin and hide the body. The enemy will waste precious time searching for him."}, {"speaker": "Leila", "line": "As you command\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Ephidel", "line": "You know, you\u2019ve only been with the Black Fang a short while. However, you are quite skilled\u2026 I look forward to watching you."}, {"speaker": "Leila", "line": "Yes, sir."}], "visit": [{"speaker": "Man", "line": "Ah, you there! You\u2019re Caelin knights, aren\u2019t you? Marquess Laus\u2019s man, the one called Bauker... He seems like a gentle man, but his skill is near legendary. Do you carry weapons suited to battling knights? Take this if you please."}, {"speaker": "Woman", "line": "Different shops carry different items for sale. If you find something you\u2019ve never seen, you should buy it, just to try. By the way, have you been to the local shop? If not, you should drop in. My daughter runs the place."}, {"speaker": "Woman", "line": "You\u2019re all Caelin knights, are you not? What? Lord Hausen\u2019s still in the castle? Oh... This was to be for our daughter\u2019s wedding, but... Here. Please help Marquess Caelin. Our lord needs rescuing."}, {"speaker": "Man", "line": "Weapons are only as strong as the material they\u2019re made of. Most of the weapons you have now are made of iron, right? Iron is a poor match for steel, and poorer still for silver! Slim weapons are weaker than iron ones, but easier to wield. Good weapons are expensive, but they\u2019re worth the cost."}, {"speaker": "Woman", "line": "Your company seems close-knit. It\u2019s vital to have friends who support and assist you, isn\u2019t it? You have to be close to someone if you really want to get along. Stay close to those with whome you\u2019re compatible to strengthen your bond. A reading by a fortune-teller will tell you who you\u2019re compatible with. But don\u2019t become so concerned about it that you forget to fight!"}]}
