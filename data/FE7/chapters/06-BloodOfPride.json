Lycia is a federation of territories, each one ruled by a powerful marquess. Now, Lyn takes her leave of one of these territories, Araphen and sets out to meet her grandfather, the marquess of Caelin. However, the marquess's brother, Lundgren, hungers to rule over Caelin. He is preparing a deadly welcome for Lyn, who stands to threaten his grasp for power."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "What city is this?"}, {"speaker": "Sain", "line": "This? This is Araphen. After Ostia, it\u2019s the second-biggest city in Lycia."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "The second biggest, hm? It does seem awfully busy. By the way, where\u2019s Kent?"}, {"speaker": "Sain", "line": "He said he was going ahead to the castle, but... Ah, here he comes now."}, {"speaker": "Kent", "line": "Milady Lyndis! Let us proceed to the castle. They\u2019ve prepared supplies for us. The marquess has agreed to aid us on our journey to Caelin."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "He\u2019s going to help us?"}, {"speaker": "Kent", "line": "Yes. Araphen and Caelin have enjoyed a sturdy friendship for many years. Once I informed the marquess our plight, he agreed to lend us his strength."}, {"speaker": "Sain", "line": "Looks like we\u2019ve got a smooth road ahead!"}, {"speaker": "Kent", "line": "If we could pick up some soldiers, the road to Caelin would be that much safer. I\u2019m truly sorry for hardships you\u2019ve suffered so far."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Don\u2019t be silly. You are so capable, Kent."}, {"speaker": "Sain", "line": "Kent!?"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Hm? Oh, and so are you, Sain."}, {"speaker": "Sain", "line": "Of course I am!"}, {"speaker": "Kent", "line": "The castle awaits..."}, {"speaker": "Man", "line": "This is terrible! The castle is burning!!"}, {"speaker": "Sain", "line": "What did you say? What\u2019s happening?"}, {"speaker": "Man", "line": "Smoke! From the castle! Hey! What are those men doing?"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Who are you?"}, {"speaker": "Assassin", "line": "You! You\u2019re Lyndis, aren\u2019t you?"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Ah!

He... This man saved me."}, {"speaker": "Kent", "line": "May I ask your name?"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Wait! Why did you help me?"}, {"speaker": "Rider", "line": "I thought a Sacaean plainswoman was being attacked. I was mistaken."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "No, you were right! I am from Sacae. I\u2019m Lyn, the daughter of the Lorca chieftain."}, {"speaker": "Rider", "line": "The Lorca? There were survivors?"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Rider", "line": "You should leave at once. A blaze has started in the castle, and it\u2019s spreading. Don\u2019t be foolish and waste the life I just saved."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "You\u2019re from the castle? What\u2019s happening? How severe is the fire? Is the marquess safe?"}, {"speaker": "Rider", "line": "The castle is under attack, and the marquess has been accosted. The man who attacked you was probably one of the marauders.

All right then, we\u2019ll help you."}, {"speaker": "Kent", "line": "Milady?"}, {"speaker": "Rider", "line": "Why?"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "These brigands are after me. If they\u2019re attacking the castle, it\u2019s because of me. So I must help if I can..."}, {"speaker": "Rider", "line": "It sounds like you\u2019re involved somehow... Let\u2019s go."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "You\u2019ll accept our aid?"}, {"speaker": "Rath", "line": "I am Rath of the Kutolah. Our tribes may be different, but I will not abandon a woman of the Sacae."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Thank you, Rath! A thousand blessings upon you!"}, {"speaker": "Rath", "line": "And a thousand curses upon our enemy!"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Come!"}, {"speaker": "Woman", "line": "You! What are you doing in my house?!"}, {"speaker": "Thief", "line": "Peace! I mean no danger to you! Your home offers a good view of the battle outside. Look, I\u2019ll pay you for the privilege. Please."}, {"speaker": "Woman", "line": "Like a vulture waiting for the spoils, eh? Terrible! Pay up! I\u2019ll be hiding below, so don\u2019t bother me."}, {"speaker": "Thief", "line": "I wouldn\u2019t dream of it."}, {"speaker": "Thief", "line": "Now then, which side has the most to offer?"}, {"speaker": "Rath", "line": "Once the marquess is safe, my men can move in. Perhaps the secret passageway..."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Secret passageway?"}, {"speaker": "Rath", "line": "An underground tunnel leading to the throne room. There are triggers in the barracks that will open the tunnel."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Head through the passage to the throne room... and rescue the marquess. Once that\u2019s done, can you drive the enemy from the castle?"}, {"speaker": "Rath", "line": "Mmm... If we can release those triggers, my men and I can handle the rest. There are three triggers, though. All three need to be released, or the entrance won\u2019t open."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "But the doors to the barracks are locked."}, {"speaker": "Rath", "line": "The enemy\u2019s within. If we don\u2019t get inside and finish them, we\u2019re stuck."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "So opening those doors is our first objective."}, {"speaker": "Tutorial", "line": "The goal of this chapter is to open the doors and reach the 3 triggers located inside. To open doors, you need door keys or the services of a thief."}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "So this is the final one.

That should do it."}, {"speaker": "Florina", "line": "Hey... This just might be the last trigger. So, I only need to..."}, {"speaker": "Wil", "line": "Aha! Found it! The last trigger... Well, here goes..."}, {"speaker": "Dorcas", "line": "The final trigger. If I just press this..."}, {"speaker": "Serra", "line": "Eww. Is this the last trigger? Guess I\u2019ll try moving it around."}, {"speaker": "Erk", "line": "This must be the last trigger. That should do it, then."}, {"speaker": "Rath", "line": "This is it. The last trigger. If I press this..."}, {"speaker": "Matthew", "line": "OK. This is the last one. This should do the trick."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Here it is, Mark! The hidden passageway! Good work!

Can I talk to you?"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "Who are you?"}, {"speaker": "Matthew", "line": "I\u2019m Matthew, a specialist in acquisitions of all kinds. Would you like to buy my services?"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "I\u2019ve no need for a thief."}, {"speaker": "Matthew", "line": "Really? And how do you plan on opening the barrack doors?"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "What? How did you know about\u2013"}, {"speaker": "Matthew", "line": "Bullseye!"}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Matthew", "line": "Don\u2019t be mad. Hire me. For you, I\u2019ll even lower my normal rate."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "I do need those doors opened... OK. You\u2019re hired. Why did you choose to ally yourself with me?"}, {"speaker": "Matthew", "line": "Hm? I was watching the battle from up above. Your group looked like a lot more fun than the dead guy. Pretty simple, really."}, {"speaker": "Lyn", "line": "You\u2019re so odd."}, {"speaker": "Matthew", "line": "It\u2019s time to get to work!"}], "visit": [{"speaker": "Man", "line": "We can\u2019t do business with all the fighting in town. You\u2019re mercenaries, right? Can\u2019t you do something? Huh? You can\u2019t get the barracks open? I bet a thief with a set of picks could open any door you needed. Hold on. I may have something here to help you... Here it is! This is it. One door key. Door keys can only be used once, but anyone can use them. Here! No charge. Now go get those thugs, will you."}, {"speaker": "Old Man", "line": "So what\u2019s your weapon of choice? Swords, lances, spears? Or do you favor bows or magic? Staves? Whatever it may be, the more you use it, the more skilled you become. Swinging your sword about will allow you to master it. Eventually, you\u2019ll be able to wield weapons of greater power. It\u2019s as they say: Practice makes perfect. You can check your skill level by pressing the R Button."}, {"speaker": "Man", "line": "The captain of the marquess\u2019s guard is a fellow named Rath... I\u2019ve heard tell that he\u2019s a nomad from the plains of Sacae. Odd, considering how the marquess so obviously hates the nomads. I guess the marquess is pleased to have a nomad under his control. The ways of aristocrats are beyond my comprehension."}, {"speaker": "Lady", "line": "The marquess of Araphen\u2019s hatred for the people of Sacae is well known. Nomads are barred entrance to the city on the marquess\u2019s orders. He says he will not allow the nomads\u2019 stench to infect his city. Long ago, the marquess was in love with Marquess Caelin\u2019s daughter. It\u2019s said she spurned him in favor of a nomadic prince. Even so, I think the marquess goes too far in his treatment of the horsemen."}], "battle-talk": [{"speaker": "Serra", "line": "I feel something... I feel it!!! Someone\u2019s staring at me!
