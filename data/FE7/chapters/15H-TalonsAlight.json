After the battle, they rest in the castle and settle their affairs. They diligently prepare for a possible counterattack. They should've spotted anyone attempting to approach the castle. And yet, somehow, they find themselves facing an unforeseen attack..."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Oswin", "line": "Lord Hector! We're under attack!"}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Is it Marquess Laus? He's come back to take the castle? Perfect! We'll catch him easily."}, {"speaker": "Oswin", "line": "No, it's not him... The attackers aren't regular army. Maybe they're mercenaries hired by Laus..."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Mercenaries?"}, {"speaker": "Oswin", "line": "Their movements are very rapid... Coordinated. They've already made their way into the castle."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "For mercenaries, they're very, very good. Eliwood, do you have any ideas?"}, {"speaker": "Eliwood", "line": "My father told me something once... There's a mercenary group extremely loyal to house Laus. Their leader is named Eubans, but he's called the Hurricane. He's famed for surprise attacks and lightning-swift strikes."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Hmmm... This could be interesting. Protect the throne! We will not lose this castle!"}, {"speaker": "Heath", "line": "Sealen."}, {"speaker": "Sealen", "line": "Is that you, Heath?"}, {"speaker": "Heath", "line": "I've secured a retreat path, as Commander Eubans ordered.

We survived!"}, {"speaker": "Oswin", "line": "The rest of the enemy units have begun to retreat. It must be part of their plan. Half of them are already gone."}, {"speaker": "Hector", "line": "Blast! You have to admire their efficiency, though. Eubans\u2019s mercenaries\u2026 I won\u2019t forget this. We\u2019ll likely cross paths again someday.

We simply have to tighten our belts and prepare. It appears we have more than one enemy.

Let\u2019s get out of here and pursue Marquess Laus. It\u2019s time to put him on the defense!"}]}
