For example, look at woods and plains. Battle an enemy from the woods, and the enemy will probably miss you. However, your attacks will be unimpeded, giving you a distinct advantage. The same is true for foes. If an enemy is in the woods, he is more difficult to hit. Factoring in your terrain benefits and the weapon triangle is vital in combat. The window at the bottom of the screen gives information on the terrain the cursor is placed on. Check to see what terrain type is advantageous by using the cursor. Now, let's put this to the test.

That\u2019s the country beyond the mountains in the south-west, isn\u2019t it?"}, {"speaker": "Kent", "line": "Correct.
