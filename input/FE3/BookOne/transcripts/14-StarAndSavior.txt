@Opening 
The League had routed Hollstadt's knights and recaptured most of the kingdom, but there was still the castle to deal with before Altea would be free; the mage-dragon Morzas remained entrenched within its walls. Unlike General Camus who preceded him, Morzas had been a cruel warden, slaughtering many innocent Alteans at the slightest provocation. Marth roiled to think such a monster still sat upon his noble father's throne.

@Intro 
Morzas: Kee hee hee… So, Marth! You've come crawling back to your homeland… just to die! I am Lord Medeus's most formidable servant… Morzas of Basilisk! You're too late! TOO LATE! Your mother, Liza, has already breathed her last! And your sister, Elice, is in Gharnef's hands now! It's all my doing! If that angers you, why don't you see if you can defeat me? Kee hee hee!

@Boss 
Morzas: Kee hee... Witless human! None defy a mage-dragon and live to speak of it!

Morzas: Grrf... I stand... corrected...B ut you still lack the power... to defeat Medeus...

@End 
Malledus: Well done, Prince! With this, Altea has been liberated. The people are so happy… Just listen to all that cheering! Do you hear them? "Glory to Marth, the prince of light!"
