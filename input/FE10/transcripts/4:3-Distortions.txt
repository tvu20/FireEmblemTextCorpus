@Intro
Lekain: The dark god's tainted minions have defeated our forces at every turn. Now they have set foot on the holy ground of the empire itself! We have no choice but to lead the army ourselves and destroy them once and for all! We are the chosen ones! Our will is the will of the goddess! With us at its head, our army is invincible!
Hetzel: Y-yes. Quite. As you say, Vice-Minister.
Lekain: When I've beaten that brat, Sanaki, I'll make her kneel before me and plead for her life! Heh heh heh! 
Hetzel: The vice-minister says he hears the will of the goddess, yet I've heard nothing of the kind in my ears. Why would the goddess choose Lekain and me? We are the ones with the most to atone for...

Micaiah: Empress Sanaki.
Sanaki: The Silver-Haired Maiden...
Micaiah: Yes, it's me, Micaiah. Um... May I sit next to you?
Sanaki: What? Oh... Uh...
Sanaki: ...Of course you may.
Micaiah: Thank you. ...This is awkward. I'm sorry. I know that you are not very fond of me, but I wanted to talk to you.
Sanaki: It's not that. I like you just fine. It's just that...you make me feel inadequate.
Micaiah: It's because I can sing the galdr of release and hear Yune's voice, isn't it?
Sanaki: How...did you know?
Micaiah: I can sense the flow of people's thoughts. By seeing the movement of a person's mind, I can usually deduce what the person is thinking...
Sanaki: You can read minds?! What a boon that would be to running a country... If I could read people's minds, I could tell what the nobles and senators were thinking behind their smiles. I wonder why the goddess didn't bless me with such power?
Yune: Micaiah was born with her power. We didn't give it to her.
Sanaki: Ah! Is that you?! The dark g—No, I mean...the goddess of chaos, Yune? Let me ask you one thing, Yune. Why was Micaiah able to sing the galdr of release, but I wasn't?
Yune: I'm sorry, little empress, I don't know. But I knew that Micaiah could sing it. That's why I stayed close to her.
Sanaki: I don't understand. How can you be a goddess and not know? I thought gods were perfect beings who knew everything!
Yune: Gods? Perfect? Where did you get that idea? You haven't met a lot of gods, have you?
Sanaki: Well, no. But divinity created life from nothing! Surely only perfect beings could do that!
Yune: We did create life, and can do many things that you creatures of flesh can't. But that doesn't make us perfect. It just means we can make mistakes on a much grander scale...



Yune: We're not what you've been taught, and we're much closer to you skin-wearers than some will admit. But we do make mistakes... Sometimes we make terrible mistakes. Sometimes all it takes is one emotional outburst, and the entire world is drowning underwater!


Sanaki: Ow! Where did this sandstorm come from? Yune! You need to calm down...
Yune: I wish we were perfect. Then there wouldn't be any wars, and no one would have to die because of our mistakes!
Sanaki: Y-yes! I understand, Yune! Now please calm down!

Sanaki: Yune?
Micaiah: She's gone now. She got upset. She hasn't lost control of her emotions like that in a long time.
Sanaki: Micaiah. I'm supposed to be the voice of the goddess Ashera. Yet I've never once heard her speak. I wonder what she is like?
Micaiah: We may find out before this is over...

@Conversation 
Micaiah: King Naesala. You are by yourself today?
Naesala: Yeah. How about you? Where's that stone-faced sidekick of yours?
Micaiah: He's just hesitant to show his emotions.
Naesala: I'm only joking. Don't get so defensive.
Micaiah: Then don't insult my family.
Naesala: Hmph. You say he's your brother, but there's as much resemblance between you two as between me and Skrimir.
Micaiah: We're not related, but we're very close. Perhaps like you and Princess Leanne.
Naesala: What?! You didn't--
Micaiah: Yes, I can sense your emotions. I also know that you just closed up to keep me from looking in.
Naesala: You possess the same power as the herons? How stupid of me to let my guard down.
Micaiah: I'm sorry.
Naesala: What else did you sense?
Micaiah: Excuse me?
Naesala: Did you find out anything else about me?
Micaiah: No! I didn't try to read your mind intentionally. I just felt that your feelings for Princess Leanne were very warm, and that's all I saw.
Naesala: You're sure? Fine. You're a lot like me. I'll let you off the hook this time.
Micaiah: What do you mean by that?
Naesala: You'll see when the time comes. 
Micaiah: King Naesala...
Naesala: I almost forgot. Here, this is for you.
Micaiah: This is a tome of light...
Naesala: We need you to stay alive, all right? See you later. 
Micaiah: Naesala...

Sanaki: How did it go, Sigrun? Did you find anything useful?
Sigrun: Only this, unfortunately.
Sanaki: Ah! It’s the tome of Bolganone! This is quite rare. Good work, Commander!
Sigrun: Sigh...
Sanaki: Such a heavy sigh. What’s wrong?
Sigrun: What sort of state is the world in, when the apostle--our empress--has taken up arms and fights alongside the common soldiers?
Sanaki: Is that still bothering you? I already told you not to worry.
Sigrun: I know. But what would the duke of Persis think if he saw you right now?
Sanaki: Ah, Sephiran... I wonder what he and Zelgius are doing right now?
Sigrun: They’re awaiting your return, of course.
Sanaki: You don’t have any doubt about that?
Sigrun: Of course not. Duke Persis comes from a family of great mages. General Zelgius is the finest general in all of Begnion. They wouldn’t have been petrified. We’ll see them when we return to the empire.
Sanaki: That’s true. I’m certain that they’re safe, too. They must be waiting for us. Let us make haste toward Sienne.
Sigrun: Yes. That is why I keep suggesting that you should stay away from danger, and--
Sanaki: Nonsense. We will fight with everything we have. And in order to fight to our utmost, we need powerful magic at our disposal! Follow me, Sigrun. Under these sands are many precious treasures. Help me find them!
Sigrun: I’m glad she is feeling better, but to see our empress is digging around in the dirt like a common farmhand... Sigh.


@Intro
Sothe: Yune "visited" again, huh? Did she have anything interesting to say?
Micaiah: Sort of. I think she might be responsible for the ancient flood that sank all of the other continents.

Naesala: Sorry to break up your alone time, you two, but we have Disciples of Order troubles again.
Sothe: Hey! That's--

Sanaki: I knew this would happen, eventually. 
Sigrun: What is it, Empress Sanaki? Oh, I see.

Lekain: Ah, my dear Sanaki, the false apostle! What a pleasure to see you again, and this time, I've an army of the righteous behind me, ready to strike you down!
Sanaki: Vice-Minister Lekain. You are the foulest kind of traitor. I can never forgive you!
Lekain: Ha ha... How amusing. Forgiveness from a fraud is of no value to anyone.

Sigrun: Empress, please don't force me to listen to his blasphemies any longer! All me to silence him for you!
Sanaki: Hold, Sigrun. I want to understand. Lekain, on what grounds do you claim that I am not the true apostle?
Lekain: The apostle of Begnion shall be the firstborn daughter of each generation in the line of Altina, first empress. She will give voice to the goddess. She will pass judgment, give prophecy, and protect her people and their lands. Sanaki, you have never once heard the voice of the goddess, have you?
Sanaki: That is... That is only because... I have not come of age yet!
Lekain: Oh, what a hysterical coincidence! That's just what the senate has been telling the people for years now! "Apostle Sanaki is too young to hear the goddess. Give her more time." How funny that the lie you've been living is the same lie we've been telling.
Sanaki: But, how... Explain yourself, Lekain!
Lekain: Poor false apostle... No one ever told you about your older sister, did they? She was the true apostle.
Sanaki: I...had a sister?
Lekain: She died before you were born, assassinated along with Apostle Misaha by the heron clan. So the senate installed you, the second daughter, as the apostle instead.
Sanaki: You lie! You impugn both me and the noble herons!

Lekain: Heh heh heh... I'm glad to have exposed your secret. Perhaps now you will be able to accept the truth.
Sigrun: Silence! The lying tongue of a treacherous senator proves nothing!
Lekain: You seek proof? Fine. We shall settle this in the ancient way: in a battle to the death. Whomsoever the goddess sees fit to win the day must be in the right!

Micaiah: Lekain! We've finally found you! Now's our chance, Sothe! We must do whatever it takes to get the blood pact!
Sothe: Right. Let's go!

@Battle
Numida: Vice-Minister Lekain, I take it we may begin? Champions of the goddess! Crush these heretics! Give them the reward for rebelling against our goddess!

Micaiah: Ugh... They're so powerful... Are we...destined to perish here?

Black Knight: My Maiden... Hold on a little longer. I am here.

@Recruit-Talk 
%Micaiah,Stefan
Stefan: Hello! How can I help?
Micaiah: What? Who--
Stefan: You and I were born under the same fate.
Micaiah: "Same fate"? Do you also carry the mark?
Stefan: Indeed. I don’t know who you are fighting, or why. But attacking my kin in the desert is the same as attacking me. I will not let them leave this place alive.
Micaiah: My friend... May I ask your name?
Stefan: When you ask someone’s name, isn’t it proper to give your name first?
Micaiah: S-sorry. I’m Micaiah.
Stefan: And I am Stefan. Well met. Let’s go.

%Lethe,Stefan
Lethe: I remember you!
Stefan: What a pleasure to see you again, noble dame of Gallia.
Lethe: It’s Lethe. I see that you were spared from petrification. I’m glad.
Stefan: Petrification? I’d like to hear more about that, but there seems to be some sort of battle on.
Lethe: We only seem to run into each other when I’m fighting for my life. Sorry I don’t have the time to catch up.
Stefan: Ah, well, that’s easily fixed. I shall help you win the battle, so we can talk properly. How does that sound?
Lethe: Sounds just like old times. It’s good to fight with you again, Stefan.

%Mordecai,Stefan
Mordecai: Stefan! What are you doing here?
Stefan: That’s what I was about to ask you! I came to see what all the noise in my desert was about.
Mordecai: Ah, so you didn’t get turned to stone! That is very good!
Stefan: Stone? What are you talking about? I suppose you’ll have to fill me in later. Let’s fight off the enemy together.
Mordecai: Good! Mordecai is happy to fight with Stefan again!
Stefan: And I as well, Mordecai.

Lethe: We only seem to run into each other when I’m fighting for my life. Sorry I don’t have the time to catch up.
Stefan: Ah, well, that’s easy. I've joined the battle, so we can talk properly later. How does that sound?
Lethe: He certainly hasn't changed.

Mordecai: Good! Mordecai is happy to fight with Stefan again!
Stefan: And I as well, Mordecai.

%Leanne,Black Knight
Leanne: (By the goddess... You!)
Black Knight: You fear me? I do not blame you. I apologize for the circumstances of our last meeting. Be assured, Princess, I am not here to harm you. If you are frightened, I shall step away.
Leanne: (Nothing good can come of his being here. He’s a walking nightmare...)

%Sothe,Black Knight
Sothe: I knew it. I knew that even if the end of the world came, you'd be the last one left standing.
Black Knight: Your faith is touching.
Sothe: Well, you and the commander. Commander Ike will defeat you, you know. You can't run forever.
Black Knight: You are correct. We will soon meet again.
Sothe: Shouldn't you sound more worried about that? You sound as if you're looking forward to fighting Commander Ike again. Don't delude yourself. You can't beat him.
Black Knight: We shall see.

%Micaiah,Black Knight
Micaiah: Ah, Sir Knight! I am glad to see you're safe! I knew someone of your power wouldn't have turned to stone.
Black Knight: I am glad to see you're safe as well, Maiden.
Micaiah: Are you here to save us again?
Black Knight: Not "us."
Micaiah: What?
Black Knight: I am only here to save you. No one else.
Micaiah: But, why? Why just me?
Black Knight: We will talk more when the battle is over. I shouldn't have said anything yet. Forgive me.
Micaiah: Sir Knight...

@Boss
Lekain: Hmm, reinforcements? I suppose I must turn back for my own safety. It is vital that I not be harmed, for the good of the world to come! While it pains me to leave the field of battle, I mustn't put myself at risk. 

Lekain: Hmm, it's beginning to look dangerous here. I suppose I must turn back for my own safety. It is vital that I not be harmed, for the good of the world to come! While it pains me to leave the field of battle, I mustn't put myself at risk. 

Numida: I don't understand. Why would they fight against the vice-minister, chosen of Ashera? Are they somehow...deficient? You will perish for your defiance of the empire, vermin!

%Nolan,Numida
Nolan: No one escapes from their past, Numida. We all have to answer for our crimes one day. Today is that day for you.
Numida: Silence, cur!

%Edward,Numida
Edward: This is for the free people of Daein! Haaaa!
Numida: Don't you idealistic twits ever give up?

%Skrimir,Numida
Numida: Ahhhh! What a fearsome beast! Only the dark god could create such a monstrosity!
Skrimir: What's wrong, little beorc? Frightened? If you cannot look upon me, you cannot hope to defeat me!

%Naesala,Numida
Naesala: Ah, Duke Numida. Unbelievable that a coward like you was changed back from stone. Particularly surprising, given some of your more...impious transgressions.
Numida: I-I have no idea what you're talking about! I am a senator in good standing!
Naesala: My country produces excellent spies, Your Grace. I know every atrocity you committed while in Daein. I actually hold quite a bit of incriminating evidence that would destroy you if it became public. It's a pity that all that work will be wasted, though, since this is the last day of your life.

%Tanith,Numida
Tanith: I am Second Commander Tanith of the Holy Knights! Enemies of the apostle, beware!
Numida: How said that you still put stock in your laughable infant of a holy figure. Fool!

%Sigrun,Numida
Numida: It's tragic, really, that the Holy Knights have wasted so much time and energy protecting a sham apostle! It's not too late, you know, to align yourself with the true chosen of the goddess.
Sigrun: The loyalty of the Holy Knights can only be commanded by one person, and that will never change. It is my duty and privilege to execute her orders and destroy the enemies of the apostle!

%Sanaki,Numida
Numida: So, child, what the vice-minister said was true! Wicked infant! How dare you pretend to be divinely inspired while you heard absolutely nothing from the goddess!
Sanaki: I...

%Sothe,Numida
Numida: Fool! Do you honestly believe that your dark god can triumph in the face of Ashera's divine majesty?
Sothe: She's not my dark god. To be honest, I don't care about the gods. They have nothing to do with me.
Numida: What?! Then who do you fight for?!
Sothe: I fight for my family, and I fight against tyranny. That is enough.

%Micaiah,Numida
Micaiah: You!
Numida: Who are you, girl?
Micaiah: Duke Numida! I will never forget your oppression of the Daein people, or your cowardly flight from justice!
Numida: Ah, you're from Daein. You should know that I had nothing to do with that unpleasantness. That was all General Jarod's doing.
Micaiah: General Jarod was a scoundrel and a fiend, but at least he had a soldier's honesty in his villainy. You black-hearted senators nauseate me, weaving a dense tapestry of lies that you yourselves believe!

@Boss
Numida: What... What's happening? Vice-Minister? I lost the battle...


@End
Micaiah: Sir Knight! How good to see you! You always save me from danger.
Black Knight: Maiden. I have a favor to ask of you. Will you come with me? My master awaits you at the Tower of Guidance.
Micaiah: The Tower of Guidance? If I may ask...who is your master?
Black Knight: You will see when we get there. Please take my hand. We will be there in the blink of an eye.
Micaiah: ...I can't. I can't leave everyone behind. We have to get to the tower together.
Black Knight: Your allies will turn to stone with the light of judgment next shines. I do not wish for you to see it.
Micaiah: The light will strike again? When? Please tell me!
Black Knight: ...Maiden. I will come for you again. Make up your mind by then. 
Micaiah: Wait...
Sothe: Don't tell me, he's gone again, right? I knew we couldn't count on him.
Micaiah: Um, Sothe...
Sothe: Lekain got away, didn't he?
Micaiah: Yes, he did. But we'll have another chance.
Sothe: I'm sure of it. I know he's going to attack us again. Don't know if that's good news or bad...
Micaiah: I know. We have to be ready.

Sanaki: Sigrun. Tanith. I need to talk to both of you.
Tanith: Empress. Why so serious? Whatever it is, you can be sure that Sigrun and I will help you with it.
Sigrun: Tanith, let her speak.
Sanaki: When the last apostle was assassinated, and I was not yet born, Begnion went a long time without central authority. The people were frightened, both of the murder and the power vacuum. Without the goddess's voice, Begnion was lost. Sephiran once told me that when the senate confirmed my appointment as the next apostle, it was as if a sign of relief sounded across the country.
Sigrun: It's true. I still remember your coronation, the first time I ever saw you, Empress Sanaki. With your tiny hand in Sephiran's, you stumbled as you walked... A little girl, barely visible in the grand hallway of the cathedral. It was a moving sight.
Tanith: I remember as well. The empress stepped on her cape and tripped a total of five times.
Sigrun: Tanith, that hardly seems appropriate.
Sanaki: I think the country's sigh of relief was unwarranted. I cannot hear the goddess's voice. I never could. This has perplexed me for years. At first I thought my youth was to blame, but this excuse grows thinner each year. There is no clear age at which previous apostles heard the goddess for the first time, but all of them had heard by now.
Sigrun: Empress, if this is about what Duke Gaddos said--
Sanaki: If I am not the true apostle, have I betrayed my people? Even unknowingly? You two are my most trusted friends. How would you feel about me if I were not the apostle? Be honest with me.
Sigrun: You would like an honest answer? Very well. It would change nothing.
Sanaki: What?
Sigrun: If you thought that our allegiance was to the office of the apostle, well, you were wrong. Even from a young age, you have been working with Lord Sephiran to fight the senate on behalf of the people.
Tanith: Our loyalty lies with you, Empress Sanaki. You will always be our empress. Please do not forget that.
Sanaki: ...I am...blessed. Not by the voice of the goddess, but by loyalty like yours.
Sigrun: Be strong, Empress Sanaki. Even if you are not an apostle, you are still the one, true empress of Begnion.

@Narration
Prince Kurthnaga tells of the connection between Daein and the dragon tribes. Ranulf reveals the identity of the Black Knight. These revelations send Ike's mind spinning in a whirlpool of confusion and doubt.
Ike becomes convinced that the answers to all of his question lie within the Tower of Guidance, and he is determined to reach the tower at any cost. His group arrives in the duchy of Tanas, near the imperial capital. Caught in a sudden downpour, they take shelter in the duke's deserted villa.
