@Opening 
To the west of Elibe lies an archipelago known as the Western Isles. Here, a sacred weapon lies waiting, the seal guarding it broken. However, to retrieve the weapon, one must pass a trial. Armads, a sacred axe filled with the destructive force of thunder. To wield it, one must prove one's worth. Hector faces a test unlike any he's ever experienced.

@Intro 
Hector: Hey, it's pitch black in here! Agh, and it's full of smoke... Hey, Graybeard Athos, you sure this is the right place?
Athos: Yes. Armads, the legendary weapon of Durban the Berserker, who took its name as his own. Armads is here.
Hector: If I've got that, I can help out Eliwood, can't I?
Athos: This battle axe is so tremendous that normal men cannot even lift it. However, it's possible that you might be strong enough.
Hector: C'mon, let's go. I want to get my hands on it!
Athos: Slow down, you fool! The spirits of the soldiers who once fought at our side against the dragons now guard the legendary weapon even in death.
Hector: ...and if I can get through them, I can take the axe, right?
Athos: There are more of them than I'd imagined. You can't do this alone. You must have help.
Hector: Fine with me, but how many people can come with me?
Athos: Too many will simply serve to excite the guardians. Call as few allies as possible.
Hector: Bah... I don't get it, but I'll do as you say.
Athos: ...Be on guard, Hector. Every act of strength you perform has consequences...
Hector: Don't worry. I'll get that axe! Now if we're calling allies, let's call them and get moving!
Athos: Hmph... You are a bold one. That is your strength, but also your weakness. Your recklessness may one day be your undoing...

@Boss 
Kaim: I am Kaim. You who search for power... You...must prove your worth to me...

Kaim: Tremendous...strength... Truly...like...his...

Kaim: …Seal… ….. could not… …protect …Such regret…..

@End 
Hector: All right! This is the throne. Athos Graybeard! I made it!
???: ...Let...
Hector: What was...
???: ...Let me fight... Me... Let me fight...
Hector: Wha-What are you supposed to be?
???: My name is... Durban... I am called... Armads...
Hector: What is going on here?
Durban: I am power. Power without peer. I am the dragonhunter. I am the fleshbiter, the bonecrusher, the skullbreaker, the doombringer.
Hector: ......
Durban: I require no seals. I have no need of this idleness called peace. Power unused is power wasted. Better to lie spent in the grave than to sit in wait. I care not who... I would fight someone...
Hector: This is one dangerous-looking fellow... Hey, Durban... I mean, Armads... Whatever. Doesn't matter. Hey, you, lend me your strength!
Durban: You desire strength? Then prepare yourself. Once you have gained such power... Your life will not end in a comfortable bed. You will die on the battlefield. In the savage garden of war's bloody delights.
Hector: ...I don't care. I will help my friend. That's why I've come this far. Armads! Your power! Lend it to me.
Durban: ...It is yours.
(The scene fades. Hector returns to camp, meeting Eliwood and Lyn.)

Eliwood: Hector!
Lyn: What have you been doing? I'm glad to see that you're well...
Hector: Hey, I told you not to worry. Here, look at this. It's the thunder hammer.
Athos: So, you have acquired Armads, have you, Hector?
Hector: Yep. Okay Eliwood, now it's your turn.
Eliwood: Mm, let's go!

Athos: We will not leave Eliwood to his task, and wait outside.

Lyn: I wonder if Eliwood is all right.
Hector: He is. No need to worry about Eliwood.
Lyn: You're right.
Hector: Aha! Look! He's coming out!
Hector: So this is the legendary blade...
Lyn: Durandal, the sword of sacred fire. ...It's strange, isn't it? I've never seen it before, but it feels so familiar...
Eliwood: I will use this to battle Nergal. Come! To the Dragon's Gate... What?!
