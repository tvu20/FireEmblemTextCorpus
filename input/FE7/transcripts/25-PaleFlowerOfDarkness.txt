@Opening 
They follow the Black Fang due south. Although the trail vanishes, Lyn uses her tracking skills, and the pursuit continues. The path leads up into Bern's impassable mountains. The peaks know no seasons, and the snow covers all in a bright blanket. In this land of blinding reflections, an ancient castle appears.

@Intro 
Sonia: So, in the end, you failed to defeat them, didn't you?
Vaida: ......
Sonia: I only introduced you to Lord Nergal out of respect for your rank. I was mistaken, though, to think that a former royal soldier would be--
Vaida: Next time will be different, I swear it. I beg of you, give me one more chance!
Sonia: Ha ha ha... "One more chance"? Surely you jest.
Vaida: Without Lord Nergal's good word, I'll never fly again! Not as a royal wyvern knight, at least! Please! Another chance!!
Sonia: Ah, but you're quite skilled at begging, at least. Desist. You have fallen from our graces, and nothing will change that. Just be grateful. You are an outsider, so you are spared the Fang's judgement.
Vaida: ......
Sonia: You stink of failure. Leave me to breathe in peace.
Vaida: ......Hm.

Eliwood: That wyvern rider.. That was the same woman we fought earlier. This proves that they took this mountain path.
Hector: Now... What have we here... What a complicated place.
Eliwood: It's little more than whispers, but I can hear human voices.
Lyn: Over there! Let's go take a look.
Eliwood: Marcus! Wait here with Ninian and everyone else. Be ready to escape at any time. I'm counting on you!
Marcus: Yes, sir. I will not fail.

Nino: Really? You're giving me a mission? Really and truly!? Mother!
Sonia: I am. And it's a very big job at that. ...It's for the king of Bern.
Nino: The king!? Such an important job... for me?
Brendan: Sonia? I'm against this!! Giving such a dangerous job to this child...
Nino: Father?
Sonia: ...You're right, this really is a job for your sons. However, we've seen nothing of them since their last report.
Nino: Lloyd... Linus......
Brendan: ......
Sonia: So my daughter will do this. And I will have no complaints from you about it.
Brendan: ......
Nino: Ah! Father......
Sonia: ...You may do as you please!!
Nino: But...
Sonia: First, business! Jaffar! Come!

Nino: Jaffar!
Lyn: Look! That man! He was at the Dragon's Gate.
Hector: Nergal's henchman. No question about it.
Eliwood: ......
Nino: Jaffar! Should you be up? Don't your wounds hurt?
Jaffar: ......
Sonia: Must you be so discourteous? It really is quite irritating. You heard the king's request, did you not?
Jaffar: Prince Zephiel... He wants him assassinated.
Nino: What? The prince? The king wants to kill the prince? Why? He's his son, isn't he?
Sonia: Nino! Be quiet.
Nino: Ah... I'm sorry.
Sonia: Jaffar, this mission is yours... and you're to take Nino.
Jaffar: ......You're not serious?
Sonia: Yes, I'm serious. This girl is my daughter. She must prove herself as soon as possible.
Jaffar: ...Don't do this. This is too much for her.
Sonia: As long as you're with her, there should be no problem. I'll brook no disagreement. We must have the king in our debt. Those are Lord Nergal's explicit orders.
Jaffar: ......
Sonia: Nino! You understand the consequences if you fail, don't you?
Nino: Um... Yes.
Sonia: Then we're off to investigate the prince's manse. I'll provide more details on the way there.

Sonia: Jerme!
Jerme: Yes?
Sonia: Where is Brendan? He just left the room.
Jerme: He went outside with Jan.
Sonia: ......I wonder what he's about... ...I'll deal with it later. Listen, Jerme. You're in charge of the guard while I'm gone. Do not let anything happen to the item.
Jerme: In charge of the guard... Bah! I was top dog until that cretin Jaffar showed up.
Sonia: Jerme!
Jerme: ...I know, I know!

Sonia: Kenneth!
Kenneth: Yes, Lady Sonia.
Sonia: Where is Brendan? He just left the room.
Kenneth: He went outside with Jan.
Sonia: ......I wonder what he's about... ...I'll deal with it later. Listen, Kenneth. You're in charge of the guard while I'm gone. Do not let anything happen to the item.
Kenneth: Understood. I will guard it with my life.

Eliwood: Do they seriously mean to assassinate the prince?
Hector: Aye. On the orders of the king, it would seem. Unbelievable...
Lyn: The Emblem is essential to the prince's ceremony, right? Having the Emblem becomes useless if the prince is dead!
Eliwood: We must stop the assassination! The girl, Nino... If we speak to her she might understand.
Lyn: Jaffar looks like a dangerous man... But we have no other course of action.

Jerme: Oh, here you are! How delicious! My blade shall feast well tonight, won't it?
Eliwood: Oh!!
Jerme: Now, which...one...first? Wait! Hold it! There are some nasty ones mixed in with the rest. Mustn't get one of them. Might ruin my sword's appetite. You don't mind do you? If I do it this way?
Eliwood: That's...
Lyn: Eliwood! There's no reason to treat with that madman!! We must find the exit...
Jerme: You! Woman! You have beautiful skin. If I sliced you into lovely red ribbons with this, would the pieces be as soft and delicate as silk?
Lyn: You...
Nils: It's no good! Something's blocking our way. We can't get out!!
Ninian: I can feel an evil power emanating from every foe here. If we do not defeat them all, the barrier will hold strong.
Jerme: Hyaa ha ha ha haaa! That's Lord Nergal's doing! He knows how I love to slice through people. He lets me do it as often as I want, which really is all the time. He's after something he calls "quintessence"... I care nothing for it, but... as long as he keeps bringing me people to slash and cut! I am Jerme! The finest assassin the Black Fang have ever known! Now come! My blade hungers!!

Eliwood: Gone...
Ninian: ...It's all right. He's still close... In this building...somewhere.
Nils: We've got to defeat him and destroy this barrier! Otherwise, we'll never leave!!
Eliwood: Mark! We have to find that man and escape this place! What are your orders?!

Kenneth: Hello trespassers. I bid you welcome. Imagine, the stronghold of a guild of assassins, infiltrated. Quite amusing, isn't it? Heh heh heh heh.
Eliwood: Oh!!
Jerme: However, you shall not leave. Sonia has given me authority while she is away.
Eliwood: You... You're a holy man. What are you doing in this place?
Kenneth: Are you referring to my relationship with the "gods"? Are you still held in the thrall of such a concept? You've met Lord Nergal, haven't you? Then there is something you must know. Gods are lies created by the weakness in all mankind. ...If a god truly exists, then it is my lord Nergal. Only him.
Eliwood: Insane...
Hector: Eliwood! Waste no time with that madman!! Let's get out of--
Nils: We can't! Something's blocking our way. We can't get out!!
Ninian: ...That man. The one in front of you... A surge of evil...
Kenneth: Nothing is more beautiful than the suffering of men. When I'm watching, I'm afloat in an ocean of pure bliss... I will watch you for a long, long time.

Eliwood: Gone...
Ninian: ...It's all right. He's still close... In this building...somewhere.
Nils: We've got to defeat him and destroy this barrier! Otherwise, we'll never leave!!
Eliwood: Mark! We have to find that man and escape this place! What are your orders?!

@Battle 
Geitz: Come on, Mark! Do you really want me? Oh, bother. I really hate the cold. What? Everyone's counting on me? ... Oh, fine ...

Wallace: Huh huh huh huh. You’ve done well to choose me for this, Mark! Weaklings! Their pathetic attacks mean nothing to me! I’ll cut through this snow like a new-forged blade!

@Recruit-Talk 
%Eliwood,Karel
Eliwood: Who are you?
Karel: Karel.
Eliwood: Are you fighting the Black Fang, too?
Karel: I heard the Black Fang was gathering recruits. I'm here to challenge them.
Eliwood: Do you... Do you have a reason to do so?
Karel: My sword is my life. My sword is my reason. You...
Eliwood: What?
Karel: You are quite good, but you will improve. Very good. I will join you.
Eliwood: You're going to help me and my friends? But...why?
Karel: Someday, you will be a great swordfighter. It would be a waste for that skill to die here. I must have you... stronger. I will wait for that time with much anticipation.
Eliwood: ......
Karel: Shall we continue? The feast awaits...

%Hector,Karel
Hector: Who are you?
Karel: Karel.
Hector: Karel, what are you doing in this place?
Karel: The Black Fang is gathering recruits. I want to hone my blade on them.
Hector: What? Do you have...a reason?
Karel: My sword is my life. My sword is my reason. You...
Hector: What?
Karel: You are unpolished...but powerful. Very well. I will join you.
Hector: You're going to lend us your blade? That's a nice gesture and all, but... Why?
Karel: You will someday be a famed general. It would be a waste for that power to be lost here. I must have you...stronger. I will wait for that time with much anticipation.
Hector: ......
Karel: Shall we continue? The feast awaits...

%Lyn,Karel
Lyn: Oh! Who are you?
Karel: Karel.
Lyn: You're a...swordfighter from Sacae. Are you fighting the Black Fang as well?
Karel: The Black Fang is gathering recruits. I want to hone my blade on them.
Lyn: Why would you... Do you have a reason to?
Karel: My sword is my life. My sword is my reason. You are... So beautiful...
Lyn: Pardon?
Karel: Your blade and mine are different, yet...Your swordplay is truly beautiful. Very well. I will join you.
Lyn: You're going to help us? But...why?
Karel: Someday you will be a renowned swordfighter. Losing you here would be a waste. I must see you... stronger. I will wait for that time with much anticipation.
Lyn: ......
Karel: Shall we continue. The feast awaits...

%Eliwood,Harken
Eliwood: You... Can it really be? Is it you, Harken?
Harken: ......Ah!
Eliwood: Wait, please! You're Harken, a knight of Pherae, aren't you?
Harken: Lord Eliwood?
Eliwood: I heard that all my father's men had fallen defending him. It's good to see you well. Why didn't you return to Pherae?
Harken: I failed in my duty to protect my sworn lord... I am not worthy of the honor of being a knight of Pherae.
Eliwood: Harken...
Harken: Before Nergal's magic, we were annihilated. When Lord Elbert was taken away, I was...powerless...
Eliwood: Nergal...
Harken: I heard he shared some connection to the Black Fang. I searched the continent for signs of them... I intended to strike against them with my final breath.
Eliwood: And that's what brought you here... In that case, Harken, you should come with us.
Harken: Forgive me, Lord Eliwood... I would rather die a knight than live in shame. I will trade my life for many of theirs.
Eliwood: Hold! Harken!! Do you think my father would want that?
Harken: Lord Eliwood, please...
Eliwood: Join me, Harken. Neither my father nor I would condone such a senseless death. Help me fulfill my father's one ambition and restore peace.
Harken: ...I understand. My life is yours. May it serve you better than it served your father.

%Isadora,Harken
Isadora: You! Can it truly be you, Harken?
Harken: Isadora!?
Isadora: Wait! You are Harken, a knight of Pherae, are you not?
Harken: Isadora...
Isadora: You... You're alive. We'd heard that all of you had perished. Thank goodness... Thank goodness you're well. But how is it that you're here?
Harken: I failed in my duty to protect my sword lord... I am not worthy of the honor of being a knight of Pherae.
Isadora: Harken...
Harken: Before that man's magic... we were powerless. When Lord Elbert was taken away, I... I could do nothing...
Isadora: ......
Harken: I learned that the man who took Lord Elbert...Nergal, shared some connection to the Black Fang. I searched the continent for signs of them... I intended to strike against them with my final breath.
Isadora: ...... Lord Eliwood... He's here, too. Come, Harken. You must join us.
Harken: ...I cant, Isadora. I would rather die a knight than live in shame. I will trade my life for many of theirs.
Isadora: Wait! Please, Harken! Don't be foolish!
Harken: Isadora...
Isadora: I've just now found you again when I thought you were lost. If you vanish from my life once more... Please, Harken. Do not waste this chance. I beg of you...
Harken: ...... I understand. Isadora, I'll do as you ask. My life for my dead lord and for his son, Eliwood.

%Marcus,Harken
Marcus: Harken! You are a knight of Pherae! It is you, isn't it, Harken?
Harken: ...... Lord Marcus...
Marcus: I received reports that said the entire elite guard had fallen... It looks like you survived. Tell me, why did you not report to Pherae?
Harken: I failed in my duty to protect my sword lord... I am not worthy of the honor of being a knight of Pherae.
Marcus: Harken...
Harken: Before Nergal's magic... we were annihilated. When Lord Elbert was taken away, I was...powerless...
Marcus: Nergal...
Harken: I learned he shared some connection to the Black Fang. I searched the continent for signs of them... I intended to strike against them with my final breath.
Marcus: ...... Harken, come with me. You must aid Lord Eliwood in this war.
Harken: But...I...
Marcus: Do not waste the life you swore to Pherae. We are knights, Harken. Be mindful of your oath. You must not die here. For the sake of our fallen master ...live now and, fight.
Harken: I understand. My life for my dead lord and for his son, Eliwood.

%Lowen,Harken
Lowen: You... Can it be? Lord Harken?
Harken: ......!
Lowen: Wait, please. It has to be you... Lord Harken, a knight of Pherae!
Harken: You... You're one of Lord Marcus's young men.
Lowen: Yes! I am Lowen. I'm currently traveling with Lord Eliwood. I'd heard that your entire company fell, Lord Harken... And yet, at least you survived! Lord Eliwood will be pleased. Why... Why are you in this place?
Harken: I failed in my duty to protect my sword lord... I am not worthy of the honor of being a knight of Pherae.
Lowen: Lord Harken...
Harken: Before that monster's magic... we were annihilated. When Lord Elbert was taken away, I was...powerless...
Lowen: ......
Harken: I learned that the man who took Lord Elbert...Nergal, shared some connection to the Black Fang. I searched the continent for signs of them... I intended to strike against them with my final breath.
Lowen: What a tale... Come, you can join us, Lord Harken.
Harken: I cant, Lowen. I would rather die a knight than live in shame. I will trade my life for many of theirs.
Lowen: Wait, please! Lord Elbert would not have wanted this!
Harken: Lowen...
Lowen: Please, be prudent. Lord Eliwood, Lord Marcus, and Lady Isabella... I know that none of them would want you to do this.
Harken: ...... You're right. You speak the truth, young Lowen. Let us go and see Lord Eliwood. My life for my dead lord and for his son, Eliwood.

%Hector,Harken
Hector: You-- It can't be... Harken?
Harken: ...Oh!
Hector: Hey, hang on! Wait a moment! Wait! You're one of Pherae's knights! Harken, right?
Harken: ...Lord Hector.
Hector: You were one of Lord Elbert's sworn men, right? I'd heard all his knights died on Valor... Why didn't you return and report to Eliwood.
Harken: I failed in my duty to protect my sword lord... I am not worthy of the honor of being a knight of Pherae.
Hector: ...
Harken: Before Nergal's magic, we were annihilated. When Lord Elbert was taken away, I was...powerless...
Hector: That dog Nergal...
Harken: I learned he shared some connection to the Black Fang. I searched the continent for signs of them... I intended to strike against them with my final breath.
Hector: And now you are here. You can fight with us, Harken. Eliwood is here as well.
Harken: Forgive me, Lord Hector. I would rather die a knight than live in shame. I will trade my life for many of theirs.
Hector: Hold, Harken! Do you think that's what Lord Elbert would ask for?
Harken: ......
Hector: I'm not from Pherae, so it may not be my place to say, but... Eliwood waited for you... for any of you to return.
Harken: ...Lord Eliwood.
Hector: Eliwood is in a war. If you're a true knight of Pherae, you need to be by his side.
Harken: ...I understand. My life is his. May it serve him better than it served his father.

%Isadora,Harken
Isadora: Young sir... Are you not Sir Harken?
Harken: ......Oh!!
Isadora: Hold! Are you not Sir Harken, a knight of Pherae?
Harken: ...Sir Oswin.
Isadora: I'd heard that your entire company had fallen. It is good to see that you are alive and well. Is Lord Eliwood aware that you survived?
Harken: I failed in my duty to protect my sword lord... I am not worthy of the honor of being a knight of Pherae.
Isadora: Sir Harken...
Harken: Before Nergal's magic... we were annihilated. When Lord Elbert was taken away, I was...powerless...
Isadora: Nergal...
Harken: I learned that he shared some connection to the Black Fang. I searched the continent for signs of them... I intended to strike against them with my final breath.
Isadora: I see... Be that as it may, Lord Harken, you may now travel with us. Lord Eliwood is also with us.
Harken: Please, Sir Oswin... I need you to understand. I would rather die a knight than live in shame. I will trade my life for many of theirs.
Isadora: Sir Harken, did you not swear a life of service to Pherae?
Harken: ......
Isadora: As a knight of Ostia, it may not be my place to speak, but... Lord Eliwood waited for you... for any of you to return.
Harken: ...Lord Eliwood.
Isadora: Lord Eliwood waits for you still. We are knights, bound by duty to the houses we serve. You can still be of service to your lord and master.
Harken: ...You are right, Sir Oswin. Forgive my weakness. My life for my dead lord and for his son, Eliwood.

@Boss 
Kenneth: You’re doing much better than I had anticipated. But it’s about time to put an end to this.

Kenneth: Does this…mean… that I…lose…

Jerme: Hyaaa! I’ll chop you all up into tiny, little pieces!

Jerme: G-Gwaah... It hurts... These...cuts...

@End 
Eliwood: Everyone is being driven mad by Nergal...
Lyn: It must be terrifying, to lose yourself entirely... To fall completely under the sway of Nergal's power... ...Hey! What could this be?
Eliwood: It can't be... the Fire Emblem?
Hector: So this madman had it all along? Let's take it and go!
Lyn: We've finally gotten it back... Let's not waste our good fortune.
Hector: Eliwood! There's no reason for us to stay any longer!
Eliwood: I know! Let's make haste for the manse! We must stop the assassination! We cannot let the prince's life be put in jeopardy!

Sonia: You know your role, yes? The plan must be carried out tonight.
Nino: Mother...just once...if only for a little while...may I...hold your hand?
Sonia: Nino, you know how I abhor such displays.
Nino: I... I know. But...I may not get another chance... And I thought...
Sonia: ...Very well.
Nino: Huh?
Sonia: If you complete this mission, I'll hold your hand as often as you like. I will even hug you and stroke your face.
Nino: Oh, really!? Then I must do my best! I will, I will! I will succeed!! Wait for me, Mother!
Sonia: I will. Be careful!
Nino: ...All right!! I'll be back!!

Sonia: Ah, Jaffar, wait here for a moment.
Jaffar: ...
Sonia: It's about tonight's mission...
Jaffar: What is it?
Sonia: Once you've killed the prince, kill Nino, too.
Jaffar: What!?
Sonia: The assassinations... Both come directly by the king's request. The prince is well loved, and his death will trigger much chaos. If the assassin is not caught and hanged immediately, the chaos will engulf Bern. A scapegoat is needed. Do you understand?
Jaffar: Nino is your daughter!!
Sonia: She is trash. Garbage. Human refuse. I'm just happy at last to have found a use for her. She did say she would do anything to please her loving mother, did she not? Her death will please me more than her living ever did.
Jaffar: ......
Sonia: ...What is it? Do you have something to say?
Jaffar: ......This...has nothing to do with me.
Sonia: When Lord Nergal found you as an orphan, he chose you because of your callous heart and your skill with a blade. Lord Nergal does not give second chances. Do not forget.
Jaffar: ...

Hector: ...Oswin.
Oswin: Lord Hector.
Hector: Have you heard anything from my brother?
Oswin: When you say anything ...
Hector: ...Come, you know... About his condition...
Oswin: No, nothing new.
Hector: I see. That’s good.
Oswin: Why do you ask?
Hector: No reason really. I’m simply concerned for my brother. Earlier... When I saw him in Ostia, he didn’t look well. When father took ill and died... I wonder if he looked at all like that. Forget it, I’m worrying about nothing. If something were wrong, I’m sure we would’ve heard.
Oswin: Yes, indeed. Now that you mention it, I did forget something. Lord Uther sent word to you through a messenger.
Hector: Oh! What did he have to say?
Oswin: Don’t trouble Lord Eliwood by being overly obstinate.
Hector: Just like my brother! Always the same thing! How many times have I told him to stop treating me like a child!?
