@Opening 
Hector and his companions defeat Marquess Laus's son, Erik, and seize Castle Laus. After the battle, they rest in the castle and settle their affairs. They diligently prepare for a possible counterattack. They should've spotted anyone attempting to approach the castle. And yet, somehow, they find themselves facing an unforeseen attack...

@Intro 
Oswin: Lord Hector! We're under attack!
Hector: Is it Marquess Laus? He's come back to take the castle? Perfect! We'll catch him easily.
Oswin: No, it's not him... The attackers aren't regular army. Maybe they're mercenaries hired by Laus...
Hector: Mercenaries?
Oswin: Their movements are very rapid... Coordinated. They've already made their way into the castle.
Hector: For mercenaries, they're very, very good. Eliwood, do you have any ideas?
Eliwood: My father told me something once... There's a mercenary group extremely loyal to house Laus. Their leader is named Eubans, but he's called the Hurricane. He's famed for surprise attacks and lightning-swift strikes.
Hector: Hmmm... This could be interesting. Protect the throne! We will not lose this castle!

Heath: Sealen.
Sealen: Is that you, Heath?
Heath: I've secured a retreat path, as Commander Eubans ordered. Just in case something goes wrong...
Sealen: I don't need you to tell me when to retreat. If we lose the element of surprise, we fall back.
Heath: I've heard there are Ostian knights among the enemy forces. Watch yourself, Sealen.

Sealen: Are we friends now? Worrying so about a complete stranger... Heath, you weren't meant to be a mercenary.

@Battle 
Sealen: Our goal is the throne. We’ll attack from the front and send another unit behind. We want to drive the enemy into a state of chaos. The ambush units are concealed as ordered. When the enemy splits its forces, we strike. That’s all. Go.

@Boss
Sealen: I’ll meet any challengers here. Someone else go after the throne.

Sealen: So this is a mercenary’s death…

@End 
Hector: Yes! We survived!
Oswin: The rest of the enemy units have begun to retreat. It must be part of their plan. Half of them are already gone.
Hector: Blast! You have to admire their efficiency, though. Eubans’s mercenaries… I won’t forget this. We’ll likely cross paths again someday. And there’s the assassins I fought in Ostia…..
Oswin: Hector? Is something wrong?
Hector: No, nothing special. We simply have to tighten our belts and prepare. It appears we have more than one enemy. Oswin!
Oswin: We’ll see to the castle defenses at once...
Hector: No. I grow weary of defending things. Let’s get out of here and pursue Marquess Laus. It’s time to put him on the defense!
