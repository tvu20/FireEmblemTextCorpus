@Opening 
With Uhai's dying words still sounding in their ears, they venture deep into the forest's heart. Lyn moves in utmost silence, cautious not to alert any hidden enemy. However, following on her path, a new Black Fang shadow appears.

@Intro 
Eliwood: A great, rotted tree... This would appear to be the place of which Uhai spoke.
Lyn: So if we move west from here, we’ll reach the Dragon’s Gate, right?
Hector: OK, let’s go!
Lyn: Hector, hold a moment.
Hector: What?
Lyn: Walk quietly. Your armor is too noisy.
Hector: Oh! ... How’s this?
Lyn: You’re still clanking.
Hector: Do you see what I’m wearing? This equipment is not light! How do you propose I walk quietly in this!?
Lyn: Stop yelling at me! It’s because of that clattering armor you’re wearing! I’m just saying we have to move cautiously. Nothing more!
Hector: I know! And I’m saying that I’m doing my best!
Eliwood: Quiet, both of you! Armor or no, if you two keep shouting like that, every enemy from here to Pherae itself will hear us!
Lyn: Ah...
Hector: Sorry.
Eliwood: We must proceed with caution.  I can’t believe Uhai was the only Black Fang in these woods.

Black Fang: Lord Aion, we’ve received word from the pegasus unit. Targets are approaching from the far side of that mountain to the east.
Aion: Hmph... Uhai must have failed after all. I’m not surprised. We’re talking about the shallow wisdom of a Sacaen nomad, after all. He possessed a certain rough talent, but no mind for planning. Our units are in place, are they not?
Black Fang: Yes.
Aion: Ha ha... Good. Very good. In confined spaces like this, my thunder magic devastates. The battle has already been won... I cannot lose. Combat is an equation. Those with intelligence have a natural advantage. Those imbeciles will not reach the Dragon’s Gate. Never. I will bury them here in this forest!

Eliwood: I can see ruins. Is that the Dragon’s Gate?
Ninian: ......
Eliwood: Ninian? Are you all right?
Ninian: ...Beware! ......The enemy comes!
Eliwood: Enemy?
Shaman: Eliwood of Pherae! Prepare yourself!
Eliwood: Oof!! We won’t reach the Dragon’s Gate if we stay on the defensive. Hit their commander, and attack the ruins!
Hector: Eliwood. Is their commander the one in the ruins?
Eliwood: I think so. It must be him.
Hector: Looks like he’s a pretty solid magic user. Bah, I’m still not confident against mages and their ilk.
Eliwood: Is that so, Hector? Perhaps you should hold back a little then.
Hector: What nonsense is that? I can’t fight from the rear!
Eliwood: No, I just meant that sometimes it’s advantageous to...
Hector: Why waste good breath on words when there’s fighting to be done! C’mon!
Eliwood: H-Hey! Hector!! ...Why do I even try?!

@Battle 
Fiora: Honored tactician... Your name is Mark, correct? The enemy commander is readying his troops beyond that mountain. I can fly over the mountain and direct you, but... Getting too close could prove to be dangerous. Bear that in mind when you give me my orders.

Kishuna: ...........
Aion: Wha-What?! The magic power of this place... The source is...distorted... I...I can’t use any of my magic!
Black Fang: Lord Aion! Disaster! A magic seal!
Aion: A magic– That good-for-nothing has shown his face?! Curses... I’d not forseen this!!

@Visit 
Eliwood: Who is it? What are you doing there!?
Renault: I’m Renault. I’m on a pilgrimage.
Eliwood: A bishop!? Forgive my rudeness...
Renault: What are you doing here? You don’t appear to be with the black-robed group I saw earlier.
Eliwood: No, we stand opposed to them. ...This is a battleground. You should stay here, Your Excellency. This battle is nothing that need concern you.
Renault: I’m sure that I cannot convince you to lay down your arms. That being the case, I give you this.
Eliwood: This...
Renault: It may help you live longer. Even if you face the misery of defeat in combat, you might yet find another road if you but live.
Eliwood: Thank you.
Renault: May you be watched over and protected in your venture.
Eliwood: Thank you. You as well, Your Excellency.

@Boss 
Aion: Thunder! Thunder, hear my cry!

Aion: This can’t be... happening...

@End 
Eliwood: Is everyone well?
Hector: Yes, somehow.
Lyn: Eliwood, I’m sorry. I said things I shouldn’t have.
Hector: No, I was shouting without thinking. I was wrong. Forgive me.
Lyn: No, it was my fault. If I hadn’t...
Eliwood: It’s no one’s fault. There’s an eerie power here.
Hector: Eerie power?
Eliwood: I don’t feel it any longer, but... It was meant to make us uneasy. Was it connected to that area where magic was nullified?
Lyn: Now that you mention it, I was so irritable... I couldn’t let even the smallest thing go by without complaining. ...What could that have been? The Black Fang couldn’t use magic either. So it wasn’t an ally of theirs...
Eliwood: Who knows?
Hector: It’s gone now, so no sense in worrying about it. We should concentrate on pushing forward.
Eliwood: Hmm. Let’s make haste to the Dragon’s Gate.
