@Intro 
Gotoh: To make it this far, Marth... It is the measure of a true hero.
Marth: Sage Gotoh! Why have you come to this place?
Gotoh: Men are foolish... and I had sworn to let the affairs of the world proceed without me. But watching your struggles, I came to think perhaps I was too hasty in my judgment. I cannot defeat Medeus on my own. But I will happily lay his minions to rest. Go forth, he who has been chosen by the goddess... Altea's prince of light! Cast the Shadow Dragon back into the darkness! Bury him in the earth he crawled out from!

@Boss 
Medeus: Rebels that dare disturb my repose... be consumed by the flames of hell!

Medeus: Me? Defeated? By humans... Mere humans... Take this to heart, Altean prince, inheritor of the light... One day... I will rise anew... Never forget... As long as there is light... the darkness can never be extinguished!
