@Intro 
Morzas: Kee hee hee… So, Marth! You've come crawling back to your homeland… just to die! I am Lord Medeus's most formidable servant… Morzas of Basilisk! You're too late! TOO LATE! Your mother, Liza, has already breathed her last! And your sister, Elice, is in Gharnef's hands now! It's all my doing! If that angers you, why don't you see if you can defeat me? Kee hee hee!

@Visit 
Young man: Psst… If you have a VIP card, you can access a members-only shop. Its location is a secret. Even I don't know it!

@Boss 
Morzas: Basilisk! I call upon your power! Burn these arrogant humans to ash!

@End 
Malledus: Well done, Prince! With this, Altea has been liberated. The people are so happy… Just listen to all that cheering! Do you hear them? "Glory to Marth, the prince of light!"
