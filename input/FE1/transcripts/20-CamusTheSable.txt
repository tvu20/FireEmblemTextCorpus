@Intro
Marth: I wish to avoid a battle with you, General Camus. Fighting you would serve no purpose. Princess Nyna wants to see you too. Forget the quarrel between us and lay down your weapon.
Camus: It is too late for words, Prince. My homeland has joined the cause of Dolhr. As a knight of the glorious land of Grust, duty demands that I fight to the last. By defeating me, you will avenge your father as well. Let our blades meet gallantly!
Nyna: Camus, wait! I beg you, wait! I cannot bear the thought of you and Marth fighting. If you would only lend us your strength... Please...
Camus: I am sorry, Nyna. If it were possible, I would... But my homeland is on the brink of ruin. I cannot betray my people. Though our time together was short, it meant much to me. I hope that you find happiness... Now, farewell.

@Visit 
Old man: It's good to see you, Prince Marth! Is my granddaughter Lena in good health? Please... give her this staff, Hammerne. It has been passed down in our family for generations. It can repair some weapons and items, but not all. Be sure to tell her to be careful when using it.

Lorenz: So Grust's glory ends here... For this, I curse you, my king.

Caeda: General Lorenz, I am Caeda of Talys. My father told me much of you.
Lorenz: Princess Caeda! You have grown into a beautiful young lady. Yes, your father was a great help to me.
Caeda: General... You did not truly want to become an ally of Dolhr, did you? Why then did you not put a stop to the alliance?
Lorenz: Grust's king is a coward. He fears the power of Dolhr.
Caeda: Dolhr's aim is to conquer all of mankind with an army of manaketes. For the sake of all of the innocents, including those in Grust, we must put a stop to that ambition. Stop fighting us. Instead, join us!
Lorenz: My feelings have not changed... I fought only because I was ordered to. But it may be time to act. Very well, Princess. It is painful for me to betray my homeland, but I will join you in this fight!

@Boss 
Camus: I pity you, for as long as I wield Gradivus, you have no hope of defeating me. Retreat and avoid this fate.

Camus: My dear... Nyna... Farewell...

@End 
Marth: Princess Nyna... I am sorry. I could not do what you asked.
Nyna: Marth... It is I who should apologize for putting you through this. In truth, since the moment I entrusted the Fire Emblem to you, I knew this would happen. I saw that once the royal family was restored by the Fire Emblem, I would lose something precious to me. Our land has a legend of the emblem, Artemis's Curse, that foretold this...
