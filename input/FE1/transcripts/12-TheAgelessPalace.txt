@Intro 
Midia: Bishop Boah, do you hear the confusion the palace? Do you think something is afoot?
Boah: Perhaps Princess Nyna was able to recruit an army and has returned...
Midia: Do you really think so? We might be saved!
Boah: Perhaps, but the enemy won't let us go without a fight... And without our weapons, we are helpless.
Midia: But this is the perfect chance to rid Archanea of its foes! I am willing to take that chance, no matter what might happen to me.
Boah: Your fighting spirit is so strong, my dear! But if you perished, Astram would surely weep.
Midia: Yes... I do wish I could see him once more before the end. But if I cannot...
Boah: If that is your wish, Midia, you must fight as hard as you can and never give up!

@End 
Nyna: You have my gratitude, Prince. It is all thanks to you that I was able to return to my home. This shining bow is called Parthia. It is one of three weapons passed down by the royal family. Our enemies have stolen the lance Gradivus and the sword Mercurius. If you can obtain these weapons, their great power will make your fight that much easier...
