@Opening 
The group sets off in search of Grado’s elusive Imperial Prince Lyon. Innes has ordered Frelian troops to aid in the hunt. The troops return with news that Lyon has moved north. The group’s search for Lyon leads them to Mt. Neleras, deep within Darkling Woods. The scorching heat and sulphur stench render the area unfit for human habitation... Endless numbers of gorgon eggs stud the forbidding landscape.

@Intro 
Eirika: L'Arachel... May I ask your advice?
L'Arachel: What is it, Eirika? There's no need to be so formal.
Eirika: It's about Lyon... My brother was right. Lyon's been possessed by the Demon King. He... He's no longer the Lyon I once knew. But I can't help feeling... there must be some way to bring him back.
L'Arachel: ......
Eirika: Please help me, L'Arachel. I want to save him. Rausten is the spiritual heart of Magvel. They keep the ancient lore. You're their princess. You must know something about the demons of legend. Is there anything that can save Lyon?
L'Arachel: I'm so sorry, Eirika. To the best of my knowledge, there is no way to aid him.
Eirika: That can't be! There must be something! Any clue, no matter how slight...
L'Arachel: Our oldest legends tell us just this... Only one person has ever been able to shake off the Demon King's domination. Rausten's founder, Saint Latona the sure-hearted, shattered his fetters. If one possesses a strength of will beyond that of normal men... Only then can one throw off the shackles of the Demon King. But you saw it for yourself, Eirika, with your own two eyes. Your friend Lyon's body has already been claimed by the Demon King. Once it's gone that far, there's nothing that can be done. When the Demon King takes over someone, he devours his spirit, their very soul. Even if his hold on Lyon's body could be released, that body would have no soul. There is no power in Rausten... not even the Sacred Stone... that can perform so great a miracle as to restore a shattered soul.
Eirika: But... Lyon...
L'Arachel: Eirika... I understand how you feel, but the prince is gone. The Lyon you knew no longer exists. It's more important now that you care for yourself. If we pursue the Demon King, we're likely to suffer for it. I want you to return to Rausten Palace and rest yourself.
Eirika: Thank you, L'Arachel. However, I must stay with the company. I have to believe there's something I can do to help him. Lyon was always so kind. He wanted nothing more than to help people. It's too terrible to picture him imprisoned by the Demon King. Imprisoned... with no hope of salvation.

Soldier: This way! The enemy went into the recesses of this valley.
Eirika: Brother. Do you smell something?
Ephraim: Smell?
Eirika: Yes. An unpleasant odor, like sulphur. It's emanating from this valley.
Ephraim: Are those... eggs?
Myrrh: Gorgon eggs... There are so many...
Eirika: Brother! The eggs! They've started to hatch!
Ephraim: No... He's led us into a trap! Watch out! Everyone, steer clear of those eggs!

L'Arachel: E-Ephraim. I must ask that you slow down! If you travel so swiftly, we cannot keep up.
Ephraim: I'm riding ahead. I can't waste any more time. I must catch the Demon King as quickly as possible.
L'Arachel: And when you find him? Tell me, what then?
Ephraim: ...... ...L'Arachel. Rausten is the spiritual heart of Magvel. They keep the ancient lore. You're their princess. You must know something about the demons of legend. I do not need consolation or peace of mind. I need facts. Lyon, as he is now... Can he be saved?
L'Arachel: I'm sorry... To the best of my knowledge, there's nothing to be done.
Ephraim: ......
L'Arachel: Your friend Lyon's body has already been claimed by the Demon King. Once it's gone that far, there's nothing that can be done. When the Demon King takes over someone, he devours his spirit, his very soul. Even if his hold on Lyon's body could be released, that body would have no soul. There is no power in Rausten...not even the Sacred Stone... that can perform so great a miracle as to restore a shattered soul.
Ephraim: Is that so... I understand. Let's go, L'Arachel.
L'Arachel: W-wait a moment. Hmph! Were you listening to me at all? I'm sorry, but the prince...
Ephraim: ...I heard you. There's no hope of saving Lyon. And if I cannot save him... I will bring him peace with my own hands.
L'Arachel: ...... But... Can you do it? Even if you get the chance, can you bring yourself to kill him? It would be best if you and your sister left this to the rest of us.
Ephraim: No...I'm going to do it. Lyon is my friend. The Demon King stole him from me. I will be the one to kill him.
L'Arachel: If your mind's made up, there's not much I can do, is there? Let's go then.
Ephraim: I'm sorry, L'Arachel.
L'Arachel: There's no need for you to apologize. Your words alone have won my forgiveness.

@End 
Lyon: ......

Eirika: Wait!
Ephraim: Hold, Eirika! Don't go anywhere alone!
Eirika: Lyon's back there! I won't abandon him!

Eirika: Lyon! Lyoooon!
Lyon: Ei... Eirika...
Eirika: Lyon? Where are you?
Lyon: I'm... here.

Eirika: Lyon... Hold on. I'll save you!
Lyon: Forgive me... Eirika... It's over... for me... The Demon King has devoured my soul... I'm mad... and I'm going... to die...
Eirika: Lyon... What should I do? How can I help you? Tell me! I'll do anything, but you have to tell me!
Lyon: ...The Sacred Stone... Give me... the stone...
Eirika: What?
Lyon: My body... is being ravaged by the Demon King. If it continues unchecked, nothing can save me. But if I had the power of a Sacred Stone... I could save... my soul...
Eirika: Lyon...
Lyon: Please... Eirika... I don't want to die yet... I want to live... with you... If I had the Sacred Stone... I could... heal myself... Please...
Eirika: Could the Sacred Stone really do that? Could it heal you?
Lyon: Yes... Please... Eirika...
Eirika: I... trust you, Lyon. I have a stone right here.

Lyon: ...... Ah... It's true... A Sacred Stone... Ha ha...... Heh heh heh... An abominable Sacred Stone... Here in my grasp.
Eirika: What? Lyon? No... You're--

Lyon: Ha ha... heh heh heh. How disappointing for you. This body is mine now. Nothing remains of your dear boy's soul.
Eirika: You only pretended to be Lyon... You deceived me. Return him! Return Lyon now!
Lyon: I'm afraid there's no hope of that. You see, I've devoured him. Bite by bite, slowly. How I savored it. Nothing remains but this suit of flesh I wear. There is nothing to heal. Not even the power of a Sacred Stone can craft something from nothing. He cannot be saved.
Eirika: That... can't...
Lyon: Ha ha... Bwah ha ha ha! I love how humans look when they're drowning in despair. Now is the time to be done with this stone.

Ephraim: Eirika!
Lyon: Oh... caught up, have you? Hmm, I've changed my mind. I'll leave the girl alive. Take her. There are memories of you in this flesh I wear. And I hunger to see your face bear more suffering and pain.

Eirika: ......
Ephraim: Eirika! Wake up! Do you know who I am?
Eirika: Brother... Lyon? Lyon's...
Ephraim: Eirika... I know. Don't speak.
Eirika: I... I... Lyon is... He's really...
Ephraim: Let's go back. L'Arachel will be worried. Eirika... You can weep now. As much as you need. Weep for me, as well...

Seth: ...It appears the enemy fled over this cliff.
Eirika: I see no way we can pursue him now...
Ephraim: So he got away, is that it?
L'Arachel: There's no cause to be discouraged. Beyond these mountains lie the heart of Darkling Woods. Before we enter, we must head north to Rausten. After all, we still need the Sacred Stone of Rausten. As long as even one stone remains, all hope is not lost. Come on. We cannot give in to despair when victory draws so near!

Lyon: ......

Ephraim: Hold! Demon King!
Lyon: Hmph... You again?
Ephraim: ...I’ve one thing to ask before I slay you. Where is Lyon now? When I kill you... will Lyon return?
Lyon: Heh heh... How little you understand. Lyon is no longer part of your world. He cannot be restored. I have devoured every last delicious scrap of his small soul.
Ephraim: You monster!!!
Lyon: Why does this upset you? What does it matter what happens to that weakling now? He was a sickly cretin whose trivial dreams were nothing but hopeless–
Ephraim: SHUT UP! He was my friend. We’ll always be friends. I made a promise to him. You stole Lyon’s soul and corrupted his dreams! I’ll crush the life out of you.

Ephraim: Gwaa...ah... What?! My body–!
Lyon: Don’t resist. Soon you will be unable to move at all...

Lyon: So you had the Stone of Renais with you after all. If you’ll just give me a moment to destroy it...
Ephraim: Stop...urgh!

Lyon: And that’s the end of your Sacred Stone... Now then, Prince Ephraim. Are you prepared?
Ephraim: Curse you... Do it!!! Finish me! With my dying breath, I’ll cut you to ribbons.
Lyon: ......
Ephraim: What are you waiting for?! Are you frightened?
Lyon: ...Tell me, Prince Ephraim of Renais. Why do you fight on? Do you think you accomplish your sad desire? Can you restore your homeland from the grave? Overthrow evil? Or protect your sister?
Ephraim: You won’t kill me. I’ll do all these things, fiend... All these things and more. For my friend Lyon... I will avenge his soul. I won’t let his gentle image be defiled...

Lyon: ...... I guess it’s true... You haven’t changed, Ephraim.
Ephraim: Huh? What’s– What did you say?
Lyon: ......
Ephraim: What’s going on? You’re the Demon King... You’re the ancient evil... You told me you’d devoured Lyon’s soul, that nothing remained. So why did you... How do you know about me? It’s not... Could it be...you...
Lyon: ......
Ephraim: Is that you...Lyon?
Lyon: Uh-huh... That’s right. It’s me, Lyon, Prince of Grado. I’m not the Demon King. Sorry, Ephraim. That whole thing about the Demon King eating my soul and me dying? That was all a lie.
Ephraim: Wha– Why?! Why would you say such a thing?!
Lyon: Listen, Ephraim. I’ve always loved you. I’ve always hated you. I’ve always looked up to you. I wanted to be just like you. Then one day I realized... Someone like me could never become someone like you. You and Eirika are...overpowering. You blinded me with your radiance. How could I live in your shadows and not seethe with jealousy?
Ephraim: Lyon...
Lyon: Before I ever touched the Dark Stone... I had a vision. A vision of the future of Magvel. I saw myself standing with two roads stretched out before me. One led to the Demon King, devouring both my body and soul. The other showed me the power to fight the Demon King’s dominion. And I, well.. ...Gaa...urgh.
Ephraim: Lyon!
Lyon: Then I acquired the Dark Stone. The Demon King began to eat my soul and corrupt my flesh. I almost vanished beneath the Demon King’s mantle. The I remembered you... My mind blazed into wakefulness. All at once, my mind shouted out, I will not be devoured! Just as I was about to lose myself to the Demon King. I was able to drive him back. The Demon King’s desires are simple–foul, but uncomplicated. He wants nothing but the destruction, conquest, and subjugation of man. These shallow desires are nothing to the dreams of the human heart. And of the two roads I had seen, I chose the latter.
Ephraim: .....
Lyon: But I didn’t want to appear before you here in the role of Lyon. Lyon, the piteous victim... The Demon King, the fiendish villain... It was all an act–high drama for you all, to suit this grand occasion. That’s right, Ephraim. I’m the Demon King... The Demon King is me.
Ephraim: You lie... It can’t be. It’s not possible. Lyon was... My friend was kind and caring... He was a good person... But you... You are not that person!
Lyon: Ephraim...
Ephraim: You... You’re the Demon King. Lyon is gone, and you are a liar! You’re trying to trick me. You’re trying to confuse me! I’m right, aren’t I?! Tell me I’m right, Lyon! TELL ME!
Lyon: I’m sorry, Ephraim. Ephraim, listen to me. Ten days from now... When the moon is swallowed by shadow... In Darkling Woods, I will perform a ceremony... Through this ceremony, I will gain immense power. Power not change not only Grado, but the entire world.
Ephraim: Change...the world?
Lyon: But after that... I cannot save myself. I’ll become the Demon King of old and try to destroy all of mankind. Ephraim. If you want to stop this, you must come to Darkling Woods. I want you to come. I need you to stop me. You must promise.

Ephraim: ...Lyon... I...
Eirika: Brother! Are you... You look ill.
Ephraim: ...Is that you, Eirika? Don’t worry. It’s nothing.
Eirika: B-but...you’re so pale. What happened?
Ephraim: ...Eirika.
Eirika: Y-yes?
Ephraim: Lyon is... Lyon’s my friend. Forever and always.
Eirika: Brother... Let’s get out of here. L’Arachel and the others are worried.
Seth: ...It appears the enemy fled over this cliff.
Eirika: I see no way we can pursue him now...
Ephraim: So he got away, is that it?
