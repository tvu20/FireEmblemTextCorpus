@Intro
Mist: Are you all right?
Ike: Nn... Yeah, I’ll be fine.
Greil: So, the sleeping prince awakens!
Mist: Father! can’t believe you! I know those are practice swords, but they’re still heavy! You have no right to be so rough on Ike.
Greil: If this is too much for the boy, he’ll never make it as a mercenary.
Mist: But–
Ike: You don’t have to worry. I told you, I’m fine.
Greil: Ha! You’d better be. Now grab your sword and get ready!
Mist: What? Don’t tell me you’re going at it again! But–
Ike: Just until I land a single blow. I’m not giving up until I can get one good hit in on Father.
Greil: I like your resolve, Ike. But it takes more than a strong will to... Hm?
Boyd: Aha! I knew I’d find you here!
Mist: Hi, Boyd. What brings you here?
Boyd: Nothing special. You said you were going to get the boss, but you never came back. I got picked to check up on you.
Mist: Oh! Sorry, I got caught up with Ike and my father.
Boyd: It’s nothing. Besides, I figured I’d get a good laugh watching Ike get worked over by the boss. You...look fine.What happened?
Ike: Nothing at all. I’m sorry to disappoint you.
Mist: You just missed it. Just a minute ago, he was out cold.
Ike: Mist!
Mist: Ha ha! Sorry.
Greil: You came at just the right time, Boyd. You can be Ike’s sparring partner.
Boyd: What? Me?
Greil: I’m beginning to think it would be better if he sparred with someone closer to his own skill.
Ike: ...I understand.
Ike: Thanks for your help, Boyd.
Boyd: Hmph! I don’t know about this to his skill business, but I’m ready!
Boyd: All right. I’m ready for you! Let’s go!

@Battle
Mist: Not that way, Ike!

Mist: Did you hear me? Not that way!

Mist: Hey! Are you even listening to me?

Mist: You can do it! Boyd’s got nothing! Take him out!
Boyd: Nothing!? I don’t have nothing. I mean, I have– I mean...

Boyd: Hey! What’s the holdup? Let’s get started already.
Ike: I’m coming. Wait right there!

Boyd: Hurry up, will you? Or are you afraid of me?

Boyd: Come on! What are you doing? Are you sure you really want to learn how to fight?

Boyd: Yaaaawn... You know, I’m getting sleepy.

Boyd: Ha ha! I’m not done yet. We’re just getting started.

Boyd: Whoa! Come on! What’s that all about? You’re wasting our time!

Mist: Ah!
Mist: I can’t believe this! If you throw your weapon away,how do you expect to fight? Let me help... Here you go, Ike. Here’s your sword.
Ike: Oh...thanks.
Mist: Try to be a little more careful!

Boyd: That–that wasn’t too bad.
Mist: Boyd, you’re such a loser.
Boyd: Shut your trap!
Greil: Good work, Boyd. That’s enough.
Boyd: Oh, all right!
Greil: Your swordsmanship was decent enough, Ike. Don’t forget how it felt. It won’t always be this easy.
Ike: I know.
Greil: Now that you’re done warming up, it’s time for you to face me again.
Ike: I was hoping you’d say that.
Greil: But first...Mist!
Mist: Right here!
Mist: Here you go, Ike! It’s a vulnerary.
Mist: I’d recommend using it now, before you fight Father. Last time, he knocked you silly.
Greil: Always take time to heal your wounds in a battle–even small ones. By the time you think you’re in trouble, it’s probably too late...Don’t get into that situation.

Greil: Give it your all!

Greil: Get ready, Ike–here I come!

Greil: Come on, boy! You going to give me a challenge this time around?
Ike: ...

Greil: Ungh...

@End
Mist: Ike! You were great!
Ike: Father, you were holding back, weren’t you?
Mist: What? Is that true?
Greil: If you could tell the difference, that means you’re improving.
Boyd: You know, I wasn’t really giving it my all either...
Mist: That is such a lie.
Boyd: Bah.
Ike: So, Father, does that mean you finally admit that I’m ready?
Greil: What, to join the company? To take on a job?
Ike: Yeah. I mean, Boyd’s already out there on the battlefield. I’m ready. I’m tired of being a trainee.
Boyd: Listen, the difference between you and me is that I’m a professional.
Mist: A professional who just got beat.
Boyd: That was just random chance. Random chance.
Greil: You’ve got a point, Ike... All right. Tomorrow will be your first day as a full-fledged mercenary.
Ike: Really?
Greil: But! If I think it’s too much, you’re back to trainee status. You’d better work hard.
Ike: No problem. Watch– I’ll catch up to everyone in no time.
Greil: We’ll see. We’d better be heading back to the fort. Everyone’s waiting.
