@Dialogue
Ike: For the past year, I’ve been focused on winning this war. I stand here today as a testament to your fortitude and commitment. I understand this will never suffice, but I wanted to take a moment to say something to you all. Thank you. I hope I may continue to rely on you.

Soren: Of course. I hope that I may continue to be of service.

Soren: There’s only one place for me to be, Ike...and it’s by your side.

Titania: You’ve grown so much... I would like nothing better than if Commander Greil and Elena could see you now...

Titania: You’ve become a great man, Ike. For now and ever more, please continue to be our commander.

Oscar: What a long road we’ve traveled! And yet, in many ways, it seemed to pass so quickly. I’m proud to have fought beside you, Ike.

Mist: We did well, didn’t we? I’m sure Mom and Dad would be proud of us.

Boyd: Great job, Ike! Of course, if I hadn’t been by your side the whole time, victory might have slipped away...

Rolf: Ike! Ike! Er... I mean, Commander Ike! I’m going to keep practicing so I can be better than ever! Thanks for having faith in me!

Rhys: Finally...it’s finally over. At long last, we can return to a life without war. Praise the goddess.

Gatrie: Ike! Are we going to go back to being mercenaries? I’m a great soldier and all, but... The easygoing life of a mercenary is the only life for me. Tee hee! Now let’s go find some good-looking lasses!

Shinon: ...Bah. I suppose you want some kind of congratulations now, right? Well, too bad. You’re a snot-nosed whelp, and I’m still better than you. Don’t ever forget that.

Mia: Heya, Boss! We did it! Whooo-hooo! You know, I am completely in love with your fighting style. If I could train under you, it would be great! So let me stick around for a while. All right?

Volke: I’ve no more work here. I will be leaving you shortly. If you have need of my services, you know how to reach me.

Ike: Elincia. You’ve had to wait a long time, but I finally fulfilled my contract. The mission is complete.
Elincia: My lord Ike... On behalf of all Crimea and my departed father, mother, and uncle, I thank you once again...
Ike: Oh, stop! Come on, will you please stop doing that?
Elincia: Pardon?

Ike: I think I’ve gotten used to a few of these noble customs and whatnot, but I still can’t handle the bowing. It makes me antsy...and itchy, too.
Elincia: Oh, my lord Ike... Hee hee!

Ike: I think I’ve gotten used to a few of these noble customs and whatnot, but I still can’t handle the bowing. It looks painful, and it’s so cold and formal. Just talk to me without all the ceremony.
Elincia: My lord Ike... That’s, um...
Ike: Yeah?
Elincia: N-nothing! It’s nothing...

Bastian: Oh, glorious day of sweet victory! Praises upon the day the goddess did see fit to send Sir Ike to save our land.

Lucia: Thank you, General Ike. Because of you, I believe we better understand how best to serve Princess Elincia.

Geoffrey: Through your strength, the dark clouds that blanketed Crimea have been dispelled. From this day forth, we will give our all to see the restoration of this land and its people.

Kieran: General, you are Crimea’s savior! For your meritorious service, I salute you! Huzzah! Nay, a thousand huzzahs!

Brom: Whew! Am I glad that’s over! When I saw King Daein, I was sure I was done for! Or that he’d torture me... But you were a bull! Thank you! Now I can go home and see my family once more!

Nephenee: When I get back to the countryside, I’m gonna boast to all my family and friends that I fought under you.

Calill: General, I owe you a debt of gratitude. I’m going to stay in Crimea and open a shop in the city. I do hope you’ll come by!
Largo: You know, I owe you a lot. I think I’m going to stick around and open an inn. Hope you’ll come by and visit.
Calill: Largo and I are going to stay here and open up a shop.
Largo: With Crimea undergoing reconstruction, there are going to be a lot of people moving about. We’ll open an inn with good food and drink. And free butter on every table! We’ll be rich in no time!
Calill: We’ll let you know when everything’s all set up. You can drop in anytime.
Largo: We’ll even give you special rates! Hmm... Maybe we should call it General Ike’s Inn!

Tanith: General Ike, I will be taking my leave of you for the time being. I must return to Begnion and present a report on the war’s outcome.
Ike: Aren’t you going to take Begnion’s soldiers with you? You lent us quite a few.
Tanith: Though the war may be over, it will take many weeks to see the country secure. I spoke with the princess earlier, and she asked that we help if possible. So I’ll leave them in your care a while longer.
Ike: We really do owe Begnion a lot, don’t we? In the end, we got not only you, but a whole battalion of reinforcements. General Zelgius and his troops are the reason we were able to minimize casualties during the final battle. He and his men took care of the retreating Daeins and allowed us to focus on the enemies before us.
Tanith: No matter the assistance you had, the victory itself is a result of your strength and leadership. I know two people who will be very pleased to learn of your triumph.
Ike: Please give my thanks to both the apostle and Sephiran. I plan to go and thank them myself someday, but...
Tanith: Understood. Fare well, General Ike. I look forward to seeing you again.
Ike: Fare well.

Zelgius: It was a glorious victory, General.
Ike: General Zelgius! What are you doing here?
Zelgius: Looking at it now, and it all may seem a bit impertinent, but... I came with reinforcements in case things took a turn for the worst. Your opponent was the Mad King Ashnard after all, and if worse had come to worst... well, you might have needed the help. Duke Perseus ordered us to join in the fight and rescue Princess Elincia at the very least.
Ike: Oh, I see.
Zelgius: My apologies.
Ike: No, no... I appreciate the concern. It was a dangerous day.
Zelgius: Your Crimean army proved up to the task. Let me offer you my congratulations. You did well to win the day. I’m certain the troops we lent you, and the apostle herself, are quite pleased.
Ike: Our success was thanks to the Begnion shield protecting our flank. Not the soldiers you lent us, but your reinforcements capturing and holding the retreating Daein soldiers. Because of that, we were able to concentrate on the enemies before us without concern for our rear guard.
Zelgius: I was merely following the orders of my superiors.
Ike: In that case, please express my appreciation to the apostle and Sephiran. One day, I will go and thank them in person.
Zelgius: Understood. Now then, I will return to Daein.
Ike: What about the troops you’ve lent us?
Zelgius: Though the war may be over, it will take many weeks to see the country secure. I spoke with the princess earlier, and she asked that we help if possible. So I’ll leave them in your care a while longer.
Ike: I see. It’s very appreciated.
Zelgius: It’s our pleasure. By your leave.

Marcia: Ike! Hey, handsome! I’ve decided to return to service in the Begnion pegasus knights! Cool beans, huh?! Oh, I owe so much to you, Ike. Thank you so very much! I’ll see ‘ya around!

Makalov: I think I may try to start over in Begnion. Maybe it’s too much, too soon... But I just want to live a more responsible life. Plus I’m tired of men threatening to break my knees... Good-bye, Ike!

Astrid: Good-bye, General Ike. This war has given me the confidence to enter the service of the Begnion knights. Thank you so much!

Devdan: Devdan is glad all the fighting stopped. Devdan prefers the peace and quiet. War is not good for anything.

Tormod: ...Well, we’re going home. All of our desert friends are waiting for us. And wow, do we have some stories to share with them!

Muarim: Laguz and beorc... Perhaps the gap between us has narrowed. War is horrible. Yet, maybe we’ve gained something of value, after all.

Stefan: Find me when you come to the dunes. We can sit and talk, with no fighting.

Ike: Are you leaving already?
Ranulf: Yep! I’m outta here. I’ve got some important guests to convey to the king.
Ike: Guests?
Leanne: (Master Ike! Thank you for everything.)
Reyson: He’s talking about us. We’re taking my father to visit Gallia for a while. We herons prefer to live near the forests, after all. Tibarn spoke with King Caineghis on our behalf.
Ike: You’re not returning to Serenes?
Reyson: While we made our peace with the apostle, we’re not ready to live there again.
Ike: I see. You’ll be able to return someday. Beorc and laguz will come to understand and respect one another.
Reyson: You may be right. I hope you are.
Giffca: Are you ready? We should be leaving soon.
Ike: Giffca, I’m in your debt as well. Gallia’s a very special place to me... I’d like to visit again someday, if I may.

Giffca: Come whenever you are able. The king will be pleased to see you.
Ranulf: Oh, and another thing. You’ll be seeing me again soon. Gallia’s decided not to spare any effort in aiding Crimea’s reconstruction. I’ll be back shortly with a whole army of workers and laborers. Look for us!
Ike: All right, we’ll be waiting.
Mist: Oh, wait! Reyson! Leanne!
Reyson: What is it?
Mist: Um...do you think...I could touch the medallion one last time? For my mom? ...And dad?
Leanne: (Yes. It’s all right, isn’t it, brother?)
Mist: All right. ... Thank you very much.
Reyson: Is that enough?
Mist: Yes. I just wanted to... say good-bye.
Reyson: Thank you.
Mist: Hm?
Reyson: And you, too, Ike.
Ike: What?
Reyson: And I’d also like to give our heartfelt thanks to your parents as well. For fulfilling the hopes of our sister... Thank you.
Leanne: (Thank you, our kind-hearted Beorc friends.)

Mist: Mmm...yes!

Mist: You... You’re welcome!
Reyson: So, Ike, when you come to Gallia, you must visit us as well. Understand?
Ike: Yes, I’ll be there. Take care.
Mordecai: Ike! I will help rebuild Crimea, too. I will lend you much strength!
Lethe: I can’t believe I’m doing this, but... I must admit that you’ve done well. You were a good fighter. Too good to leave with these beorc. We’ll meet again.

Lethe: I don’t know when, but... If that thing we talked about happened...that would be fine. I guess. Not that I care. So...good-bye.

Tibarn: Well, it’s about time for us to take wing.
Ike: We’ve built quite a close bond, haven’t we?
Tibarn: This is true. We’re especially grateful for your help in Serenes Forest. The next time you’re visiting the southern coast, come to Phoenicis. The entire country will celebrate your arrival.
Ike: The country of the hawk tribe, eh? That would be fun. I’m interested in what kinds of food you eat.
Tibarn: We collect berries from trees on peaks that no beorc could climb. The juices and desserts made from it are beyond compare. We have ocean delicacies, mountain treats... We have everything.
Ike: I’ll pass on the desserts... But I’ll take extra helpings of meat!
Tibarn: Ha ha! Leave it to me.
Naesala: I hate to interrupt your gleeful chat, but I thought I should tell you... You don’t have to visit Kilvas. It’s our policy not to invite beorc into our home. Unless they pay well...
Ike: Ah, King Kilvas... Despite all of your posturing, you came to our aid in the end! You turned out to be a better ally than I dared hope for.
Naesala: Pah! Keep your foolish tongue inside your foolish head! ...And don’t tell anyone! I have a reputation to think of.
Tibarn: Fare well. And I’m serious about Phoenicis, too. Come anytime!
Ulki: General, the bird tribes are in your debt. ...We are grateful. Please take care.
Janaff: If you ever have need of the king’s eyes, fire a flaming arrow from a high place. I’ll see it and come flying! Um, that is, if I’m not busy on an errand for the king.

Ike: ...
Jill: ...General Ike. I, I will never, ever forget you. Thank you for showing me the error of my ways.
Haar: I’m just glad that it’s finally over. Maybe now, I can get some sleep. Yaaawwwnn... Zzzzzzz...
Sothe: Things are going to be rough in Daein, too. I don’t know what the future holds, but I’m heading back. It’s my homeland, after all.
Tauroneo: ...I have played my part. All that remains is for me to take my leave of this place. History will judge my actions...
Ilyana: Muston and the others are going to Daein, and I think I’m going to go with them. Thank you for everything, General Ike. Hmm... I hope they packed enough food... I’m pretty hungry...
Zihark: Crimea’s an interesting place, but I’ve decided to travel to Daein. Perhaps fate will bring us together again.

Ike: How odd, Ena. We’ve been both enemies and allies.
Ena: Thanks to you, Rajaion was saved. And...so was I... Thank you.
Ike: So, you were with King Daein because you were trying to save Rajaion?
Ena: Yes.
Nasir: Ena’s fiance went missing many years ago. After Ena finally found him, she came to me for help. She told me that Rajaion was with King Daein, and that he had been warped almost beyond recognition. Long ago, Ena’s parents died, and I was unable to do anything for her. Even so, she still came to me for help. No matter what, I had to help her... It was to that end that I used you...... I am so sorry.
Ike: It’s all in the past now. There’s nothing for you to worry about any longer.
Nasir: Thank you, Ike.
Ike: Will Ena return to Goldoa?
Nasir: Yes. We must take Rajaion back to his hometown.
Ike: We? Are you going, too, Nasir?
Nasir: Yes, I am. For the first time in decades, I will walk on Goldoan soil.
Ike: That’ll be nice. Take care of yourself. And give my regards to Kurthnaga.
Nasir: I will. Until we meet again.
Ike: Nasir!
Nasir: Hm?
Ike: I don’t know what you thought, but I... I always trusted you. Except for that one moment when I learned of your deception, I never thought of you as an enemy.
Nasir: Huh. Even now you defy my prediction.
Ike: Prediction?
Nasir: When we were sailing off the coast of Phoenicis, remember? I said that war would change how you look at things. And yet... Through all that’s happened, you’ve remained the same.
Ike: I just can’t pretend to be anything I’m not. I’ve never been any good at that.
Nasir: Please stay that way, Ike. Don’t change for anyone.
Ike: I’ll see you again, won’t I?
Nasir: Yes, I’m sure of it.

@Narration
Restoration The war is over. The Crimean people, who suffered gravely during the harsh Daein occupation, have at last regained their freedom. These same Crimeans have a saying: No matter how harsh the winter, spring will ever follow. This popular proverb proves true as the warm winds of change begin to blow across the countryside. The war has left the country in ruins, but the people rise from the ashes and take the first steps towards rebuilding their nation. Though once scorned and despised as sub- humans, the laguz put aside past enmity and come to the aid of their neighbors. And the Crimeans never forget it was Gallia that fought beside them and helped free them from the yoke of Daein oppression. Led by the examples of Elincia and her retainers, Crimea begins transforming into the land its king had dreamed of. A land where beorc and laguz live together in harmony and equality. As the reconstruction efforts progress, the administrative government announces the enthronement of Elincia as the new queen. And now, the day of her crowning arrives.

@Dialogue
Mist: Hah...I’m so tired I could fall over! Peace is all well and good, but it sure is busy.
Ike: We’re rebuilding a country that was completely devastated by war. It’s bound to be tough.
Mist: You’re right. I bet Princess Elincia and the people in the palace are twice as busy.
Ike: Speaking of Elincia, what’s she doing?
Mist: She’s in that room over there, surrounded by court officials. They seem really busy. I feel so sorry for her.
Ike: As long as she’s getting at least a little bit of rest, I’m not worried. But she probably isn’t...
Mist: Maybe if I sang her a lullaby... Ah! Oh, no! I forgot!
Ike: You forgot what?
Mist: I gave the medallion to Reyson, but I forgot all about the galdr! Ike, what should we do?!
Ike: Hey, yeah... We never did find out who Altina is, did we? She was the only one who could sing the galdr... Well, when things calm down, we’ll have to head out and search for her.
???: Is that Altina you speak of? One of the three who defeated the dark god?
Mist: Hey!
Ike: Sephiran! So you made it, did you?
Sephiran: I arrived mere moments ago. Let me congratulate you on a successful end to your journey.
Ike: Thank you. Please tell me, do you know who Altina is?
Sephiran: Of course. Altina founded my homeland of Begnion.
Ike: Oh, then it was a mistake... We can’t give a song to someone who died so long ago...
Sephiran: There is one who yet shares both bloodline and name–the true heir of Altina.
Ike: Who is it?
Sephiran: Sanaki Kirsch Altina... None other than the apostle herself.
Ike: The apostle? Is this something everyone in Begnion would be aware of?
Sephiran: No, there are very few who know that name. Why do you ask?
Ike: The apostle is Altina...
Mist: Oh, I’m so relieved! And exhausted, too! Ike, I’m going back to my room. See you later, Sephiran.
Sephiran: That was rather sudden. Did I say something to cause her distress?
Ike: ...No, nothing like that. It’s just that so much has happened between Begnion and Serenes...
Sephiran: Would you tell me about it? I would hear what you have to say on this matter.
Ike: Sure. To tell the truth...
Sephiran: I see... The assassination of the apostle, the Serenes massacre, and the use of the medallion to revive the dark god... All of it was part of Ashnard’s grand scheme.
Ike: That’s the conclusion we came to.
Sephiran: ...You have me at a loss.
Ike: Why is that?
Sephiran: For many years, I have walked these lands. Watching... Listening... And never did I uncover what you have found. Now that you have presented me with this information, I don’t know what to say.
Ike: I merely fulfilled the hopes of my father and mother.
Sephiran: Now you speak from hindsight. Rescuing Princess Crimea, winning the apostle’s trust, and defeating King Daein... With laguz at your side, no less! You have accomplished all of these miraculous things.
Ike: I had trusted and valiant companions at my side. It was only through their support that I was able to do these things.
Sephiran: Ever the humble one, eh? Now then, before I return home, may I hear the galdr of release? I must convey it to the apostle.
Ike: You would do that?
Sephiran: None of you can leave Crimea. The new queen will need your strength.
Ike: ...I suppose that will be the case for a little while, won’t it?
Sephiran: ...A little while? You are the hero of Crimea, General Ike. If you wish it, no post will be beyond your reach.
Ike: I don’t care about any of that. It’s more trouble than it’s worth. And I don’t see the value of being some fancy lord. When the country’s safe, I’m giving up that title and everything and going back to being a simple mercenary.
Sephiran: Ha ha... T-truly...you are a... Wha ha ha ha ha!
Ike: Is something strange?
Sephiran: Yes. It’s very... Haaaa ha ha haaaaa!
Ike: Um, I think that’s enough.
Sephiran: I’m...I’m s-s-sorry. ...Hee! Hee... Ahem...
Ike: Unbelievable. Despite all appearances, you’re really quite rude.
Titania: Commander? May I have a minute?
Ike: Sure. What is it, Titania?
Titania: Princess Elincia... Oops! It’s Queen Elincia, isn’t it? The court ministers want Queen Elincia and you to come out onto the balcony and greet the people.
Ike: What? Greet the people? ...Me?
Titania: Yes, you. I’ve done what I was asked to do! Now hurry up and get going!
Ike: H-hey! Titania! Ah, nuts! Why do I... What’s going on?
Sephiran: The people of Crimea wish to see their hero and to sing his praises–even if the hero himself protests.
Ike: If they want a greeting, surely their new queen, Elincia, would suffice. I’ll go speak to her.

@Cutscene
Ike: What’s wrong?
Ike: Everyone’s waiting to see you.
Elincia: I’m nervous. I’ve spent my whole life in hiding. No one ever taught me how to rule a kingdom. I don’t think I’m ready to be their queen. I don’t think I’m ever really going to be ready.
Ike: What’s the matter with you?
Elincia: Ike, stop it! How can I–
Ike: Did anyone teach you how to hire mercenaries?
Elincia: No, but that’s not the same–
Ike: How to win back lost allies? How to win back your lost kingdom?
Elincia: But that’s… That’s different.
Ike: No, it’s not.
Ike: You’ve done such an amazing job. And I think you always will.
Elincia: I see.
Ike: All right, come on. We’ll do this together.
Elincia: Thank you, my lord Ike. I am… I am so blessed to have met you.

@Narration
And so it was that, in the spring of the year 646, Elincia Ridell Crimea saw peace return to her homeland. In the years to follow, the story of Queen Elincia and her noble hero, Ike, spread across the land and inspired the songs of many a wandering troubadour.
