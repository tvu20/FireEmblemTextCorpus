@Opening 
Roy headed towards the ruins in Sacae, after the Divine Weapon.

However, the remaining forces of the Djute clan were waiting for Roy in the
ruins...

@Intro 
Soldier: The Etrurian Army is here!
Thoril: They won’t stop until they make everything theirs... We will not let that happen. Tell our brothers that we will defend this land to the death. We will avenge our dead comrades!
Soldier: Yes!
 
Roy: The Divine Weapon lies here... Sin, do you know about this place?
Sin: All I know is that the Divine Warrior Hanon’s bow, the Miurgre, or the Bow of the Winds, is kept here.
Roy: Hanon... She and Saint Elimine were the only two women among the Eight Heroes.
Sin: So it seems. ...Watch your back. The Djute will give us everything they’ve got to avenge their clansmen.
Roy: All right, we have to be careful. Let’s go!

@End 
Soldier: It’s here! The bow is hidden in the altar!
Roy: This is the Miurgre... It looks like an ordinary bow, but it must have incredible power.
Merlinus: Master Roy, Bern’s troops are retreating.
Roy: Oh. All right.
Merlinus: All right? We must give chase.
Roy: No, don’t. They’re fleeing. They don’t have any more will to fight.
Merlinus: But...
Roy: They have families as well. There’s no need to fight more than necessary.
 
Roy: Merlinus, I need you to send this letter to Bishop Yoder in Etruria.
Merlinus: A letter? May I ask what it says?
Roy: It’s the story we heard from Niime about the Dragons.
Merlinus: Oh? What did you discuss with her about the Dragons?
Roy: It’ll be long if I tell you. I haven’t sealed the letter yet, so you can look through it if you want.
Merlinus: All right. Let me see...
Guinevere: ...Roy.
Roy: Princess, is something wrong?
Guinevere: ...We enter Bern now.
Roy: Yes. We will attack Bern very soon. So...may I ask the rest of the story now...?
Guinevere: ...Yes. That is why I came to you.
Roy: King Zephiel was an outstanding pupil is his studies, he was skilled in warcraft... He grew to be the perfect heir for the king.
Guinevere: That is correct.
Roy: But still, the former king did not look kindly at him.
Guinevere: In fact... Our father began to hate Zephiel because he grew to become such a brilliant and worthy youth.
Roy: What...is that supposed to mean...?
Guinevere: Our father was a man of ordinary skill and intellect. Therefore, Zephiel’s outstanding skill made our father cold towards him.
Roy: Jealousy...?
Guinevere: And then one day, our father told Zephiel that ‘the next heir to Bern would be Guinevere’s husband.'
Roy: What! That’s awful!
Guinevere: But Zephiel was very patient. He said that he did not mind even if he could not gain the throne. But the people around us, who were looking forward to Zephiel’s ability to be a good king, would not allow anyone else to be the heir. Pressured by the public, our father lost his patience at last, and...
Roy: Decided to kill King Zephiel...?
Guinevere: At a banquet, our father gave Zephiel a poisoned drink from his own hands. And that was the first and last cup that Zephiel took from our father. After returning to his room, Zephiel started to get sick. For ten days and nights, Zephiel lingered between life and death. But Murdock, Zephiel’s teacher and loyal general, saved his life.
Roy: ...The former king never did anything after that?
Guinevere: No... But I have heard that he had plans to get rid of Murdock and Zephiel’s mother as traitors. He was scheming to murder them all along with Zephiel. After hearing that, Zephiel made believe that he was dead. Our father then checked the coffin to confirm Zephiel’s death. At that moment, Zephiel rose up from the coffin and...with his sword...
Roy: ......
Guinevere: I was but a child then, so naturally I could not have understood what was going on. All I knew is that after our father died, Zephiel never smiled again. Until then, he was strict at times, but he was always a kind and loving brother to me. So...
Roy: Princess...
Guinevere: So I... At the bottom of my heart, I trust that Zephiel can change, that he can become that loving brother again. I...had to take action.
Roy: I...see...
Guinevere: ...But now, my brother is in a place where my words cannot reach him. Roy, please... Please stop him. Please stop him from inflicting pain and suffering to the people of Bern...and the rest of Elibe.
Roy: Even if it may resolve to the blade?
Guinevere: ...I have made my resolve when I entrusted this task to you.
Roy: I see. You have my word and loyalty, Princess Guinevere. I swear to the Fire Emblem that I will stop King Zephiel!
