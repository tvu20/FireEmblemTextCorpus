@Opening 
Roy ventured deep inside the Temple of Seals. Apparently, there was something else hidden there other than the Binding Blade.

However, Pereth, one of Murdock’s best lieutenants, was already inside the temple and waiting to ambush Roy.

@Intro 
Pereth: So the battle above the ground was lost...
Soldier: Yes.
Pereth: I would have liked to be at Lord Murdock’s side when he fell.
Soldier: ...We share your feelings.
Pereth: However, we have an important mission from Lord Murdock. We must defend this Divine Weapon. The Silencing Darkness, Apocalypse, must not fall into the enemy’s hands!
 
Roy: There’s a Divine Weapon under here?
Melady: Yes, I believe so. I have only heard rumors within the army, but apparently there is a spell book here that was placed to protect the Temple of Seals from intruders.
Elffin: This place is guarded by Bern’s troops as well. It is highly probable that the spell book that she speaks of is a Divine Weapon.
Roy: Yes. We’re going up against Zephiel soon. ...I want to have as many weapons as possible ready before we enter the castle. We have to get that book.
Melady: I have also heard rumors that there are traps all over the underground level.
Roy: Traps?
Melady: Yes. Apparently, they are crafted so well that we have no chance of finding them before they go off. Perhaps Thieves would be better at spotting the traps... Anyway, please be careful.
Roy: All right. Let’s be wary.
Roy: Princess Guinevere, is this where the Divine Weapon is?
Guinevere: Probably... I have only heard rumors that there is a spell book here that was placed to protect the Temple of Seals from intruders.
Elffin: This place is guarded by Bern’s troops as well. It is highly probable that the spell book that she speaks of is a Divine Weapon.
Roy: Yes. We’re going up against Zephiel soon. ...I want to have as many weapons as possible ready before we enter the castle. We have to get that book.
Guinevere: I also understand that there are numerous traps placed in the underground level.
Roy: Traps?
Guinevere: Yes. They are designed so well that it would be impossible for us to find them. Perhaps Thieves would be better at finding them... Please be careful.
Roy: Yes, Princess. We will be careful.

@Boss 
Pereth: Darkness from an age long forgotten… I will show you its power.

Pereth: Dark… It is getting so…dark…

@End 
Roy: Elffin, do you know what this spell book is?
Elffin: ...It is probably the Apocalypse spell book.
Roy: Apocalypse?
Elffin: Yes, it is also known as the Silencing Darkness. Brammimond... the most mysterious of the Eight Heroes...used it.
Roy: Brammimond... I only know his name.
Elffin: We don’t even know if Brammimond was male or female, old or young. None of the ancient scrolls say anything specific about Brammimond.
Roy: I see...
Elffin: ......
Guinevere: Roy, is something wrong?
Roy: No, I was just thinking.
Guinevere: About what?
Roy: I was wondering why there’s always some kind of trap where a Divine Weapon lies.
Guinevere: ...Perhaps it is to warn people that their power is too great to be dealt with lightly.
Roy: But still... The traps are so carefully set. There must be other reasons.
Guinevere: ......
Elffin: ...I wondered about the same thing. Perhaps I shall look into it.
Roy: Yes... Please.
