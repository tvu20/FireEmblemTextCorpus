@Opening 
Roy couldn't believe Larum's story.  He quickly penned off a letter to Cecilia
letting her know of the horrors happening on the Western Isles.  He also let
her know of the actions that he planned to take from now.

After sending the letter, Roy and company moved towards the mine in Mt Ebrakhm
to try and rescue the people suffering from forced labor.

Etruria had assigned Bishop Oro of the Elimine Church to supervise the mine.
Already a large amount of minerals had been taken, but it seemed that they
ever wanted more and more...

Ebrakhm...known now as the Mine of Death.  The wails of the people forced into
labor there echoed through the mines, like the howling of ghosts...

@Intro 
Melady: I see... So Princess Guinivere is nowhere on the Western Isles?
Oro: We searched all over these islands, and we sent spies in to Lycian League, but we could not find the princess anywhere, I'm sorry.
Melady: I understand. I suppose I will search elsewhere. Bishop Oro, I thank you for your cooperation with Bern.
Oro: I will pray that you will be able to meet Princess Guinivere soon.
Melady: Thank you.

Etruria Soldier: Bishop Oro, who was that?
Oro: A Dragon Knight from Bern. Her name is Melady. She was looking for Princess Guinivere, who is her mistress.
Etruria Soldier: Did you tell her where the princess is?
Oro: Of course not. Princess Guinivere is a valuable hostage. When Advisor Roartz heard the news that Cecilia was hiding with Guinivere in Aquleia, he was as excited as the time when he reported the assassination of Prince Myrddin had been successful.
Etruria Soldier: Bishop Oro! You mustn't say he was assassinated...
Oro: Oh, I must watch my tongue. Anyway, Guinivere has much value.
Etruria Soldier: I see...
Oro: And now, why did you come before me? Did you not have something to say?
Etruria Soldier: Yes, my lord. It is about the village where the resistance leader is hiding. We are now prepared to launch an attack on the village, so I came to report.
Oro: All right, well done. Then start your attack immediately, before we have any unwanted interruptions...

Roy: So the resistance hideout is in one of these villages here?
Larum: Yes. But it's possible the landlord's troops have attacked it already.
Merlinus: I must say, that Oro is a despicable man. A bishop should be preaching the words of God to help the people. But in fact he is torturing his people! That is far from forgivable.
Roy: We should probably wait for General Cecilia's reply, but...
Lycia Solider: Master Roy! Troops from the castle are attacking the villages!
Merlinus: What! Master Roy, should we attack?
Roy: I guess we can't wait for her reply then... But I want to help the people here. Even if it means that we'll be on bad terms with Etruria.
Larum: Roy..
Roy: Let's fight!! So we can be proud of our actions when we return to Lycia!

@Battle 
Galle: Melady, did you find out anything about Princess Guinevere?
Melady: No... It looks like she left the Lycia Alliance Army. Just when I thought I had found her...
Galle: Well, then it’s no use looking here, I suppose.
Melady: Galle...I’m sorry. My squad was the only one assigned to look for the princess because King Zephiel wanted to keep it in secrecy. I’m sorry that I got you into this mess...
Galle: You have enough to worry about already... Don’t fret over things like that.
Melady: But you’re one of the captains working directly under General Murdock...
Galle: Don’t worry about that, General Murdock has agreed to my helping you. Anyway, Princess Guinevere must still be on the mainland. I guess we can ask General Narshen for help.
Melady: ...You’re going to bow down to Narshen?
Galle: ? Of course. He’s one of the Three Dragon Lords, and he’s leading the divisions in Lycia and Etruria.
Melady: Galle, aren’t you...mad?
Galle: About what?
Melady: I mean... You’re the one who should be a Dragon Lord. ...But Narshen accused you of not being a native of Bern, and he snatched the position away. And you’re going to bow down to him and ask him for help?
Galle: Well, what he said was true. I wasn’t born in Bern.
Melady: But...
Galle: Melady, don’t worry. I’m happy with the position I have now. King Zephiel and General Murdock put trust in me, even though I’m not a native of Bern. What more could I ask?
Melady: Galle...

Oro: Hahaha... I’ve got an idea... Someone!
Soldier: Yes, Bishop Oro?
Oro: Tell the bandits that the villagers in chaos. I want them to ransack the villages and collect the valuables.
Soldier: Yes. But... Are you sure? If this becomes public...
Oro: You forget that I speak for God Himself. If anyone tries to accuse me, he would be accusing God. There is no one on this island who can prosecute me! Now hurry. It will be a chance wasted if the crisis in the villages settles down.
Soldier: Yes.

Klein: So that’s the Lycia Alliance Army...
Thea: They’re supposed to be fighting against the bandits...
Klein: I know. But Lord Arcard says that they are working with the bandits to attack innocent villagers. Why are they doing the opposite of what they were told...?
Thea: ......
Klein: Thea, can you take your troops and attack from the north? I’ll start attacking from here.
Thea: Yes, General Klein.
Klein: Thea! Wait.
Thea: Yes?
Klein: I heard that you have some siblings.
Thea: Yes. I have two sisters, one older, one younger.
Klein: Are they both Pegasus Knights like you?
Thea: Yes. Why do you ask?
Klein: Well, you see, I have a younger sister myself...
Thea: You have a sister? She must be very beautiful.
Klein: Thank you. Yes, she is pretty. But I heard that she got tangled up in some, mess and I don’t know where she is now...
Thea: What? Oh my...
Klein: I’ve sent out some people to look for her, but they haven’t had any luck. If I weren’t on this mission, I would go search for her myself...
Thea: ......
Klein: Thea, take care of yourself. For your family’s sake.
Thea: Yes, thank you.

Klein: All right, let’s go.
Soldier: Sir, are you sure?
Klein: About what?
Soldier: Lord Arcard said to leave the fighting to Ilia’s Pegasus Knights so that we Etrurians suffer the least casualties.
Klein: Don’t be ridiculous, they are our companions and trustworthy comrades. We will fight full-force to support them. Understood?
Soldier: Yes, General Klein.
Klein: ...Still, Lord Arcard’s story is strange... The Alliance Army just got here. Would they get tied in with the bandits so quickly...?

Bandit: So you’re sure we can raid the villages as much as we want?
Soldier: Yes. But in return...
Bandit: Yeah, yeah, we’re supposed to take half of the loot to the castle, right? That’s one hell of a bishop you guys got yourselves over there.
Soldier: Thank you for your cooperation.
Bandit: All right, boys! Loot the villages! Grab all the treasure!

Soldier: Master Roy, bandits are appearing from the mountains in the east.
Roy: They’re thinking of attacking the villages during the confusion... We have to stop them!
Thea: Are you ready? We’re moving southward!
Soldier: Captain... Are you sure we’ll be all right?
Thea: Why?
Soldier: Perhaps the Etrurian army means to use us up front as pawns...
Thea: Who says that?
Soldier: One of our group heard rumors like that in the Etrurian army.
Thea: If you take rumors seriously all the time, you won’t be able to do anything in battle.
Soldier: But...
Thea: Besides, even if that were true, General Klein wouldn’t approve of it.
Soldier: Do you think so?
Thea: General Klein’s not like that. I trust him.
Soldier: ...All right. Then we’ll trust him as well, for we trust you, Captain.
Thea: Thanks. All right, let’s go!

Soldier: Echidna! We have surrounded this entire area! We know you’re hiding in there! Drop your weapons come out at once!
Echidna: ......
Soldier: Are you Echidna, the leader of the rebel forces?
Villager: Miss Echidna, I’m sorry! They took my family hostage to make me talk...
Echidna: Don’t worry, I understand. Leave this to me. Hurry home to your family now.
Villager: I’m sorry...really.
Soldier: If you surrender peacefully, perhaps Bishop Oro will have mercy on you.
Echidna: Sorry, but I’m sorta the stubborn type.
Soldier: Do you resist? Then we have no choice. Kill her!
 
Oro: What is taking so long!? Are the rebel forces that much of a problem?
Soldier: It’s the Lycia Alliance Army! They’re helping the rebels!
Oro: What!? The Lycia Alliance would turn against Etruria!?
Soldier: We have just received a message from the capital at Djuto! It says... ‘The Lycia Alliance Army is responsible for the murder of Duke Nord, and is suspected of treachery against Etruria. They may be allied with the bandits. Capture them!'
Oro: So they killed Nord... It looks like they’ve come up with a good excuse to get rid of the Alliance Army. Hahaha... Allied with the bandits. eh? How ironic...
Soldier: Lord Arcard has also provided us with some reinforcements to help us defeat the Lycia Alliance Army. They should be arriving shortly.
Oro: How generous! He said to capture them, but he probably plans on killing them anyway. Let us do the job for him! Kill them all!
Soldier: Yes, Bishop Oro!

@Recruit-Talk 
%Clarine,Klein
Clarine: Klein!
Klein: Clarine!? You were safe! Thank goodness...
Clarine: I’m sorry I left without telling you... But I wanted to see you so badly.
Klein: The things you would do... Well, you’re safe, and that’s what matters. And what brings you out here? Did you find someone trustworthy to hire?
Clarine: No, I joined the Lycia Alliance Army and have been fighting alongside them.
Klein: The Lycia Alliance Army!?
Clarine: Yes, my healing staves have been very useful!
Klein: ..I see. I thought your eyes looked...sharper.
Clarine: I’m now a lady, I am.
Klein: ...Let me ask you this. What kind of an individual is General Roy?
Clarine: Hmm... He lacks a little finesse for a noble... I especially think that he has to take care of his hair a little better...
Klein: ...Let me rephrase the question. Is General Roy working with the bandits and attacking the people living on these islands?
Clarine: No, of course not! We are here to defeat the bandits!
Klein: I see...
Clarine: The Etrurians here are all malicious and evil people...it is so embarrassing! Klein...are you working for them?
Klein: No. At least not any after I heard your story.
Clarine: What?
Klein: I was sent here to protect the villagers. To fulfill my mission, I will hereby join the Lycia Alliance Army.
Clarine: Klein!
Klein: Then let’s go, shall we? Will you introduce me to General Roy?
Clarine: Of course! I love you, Klein.

%Klein,Thea
Klein: Thea!
Thea: General Klein! What is the matter?
Klein: I’ve made up my mind. We’re going to fight alongside General Roy in the Lycia Alliance Army.
Thea: Understood, sir. Then we will as well.
Klein: Aren’t you going to ask why?
Thea: We are mercenaries. We follow our employer’s every order. Besides...
Klein: Besides...?
Thea: I trust your judgment, General Klein.
Klein: Thank you, Thea.

%Larum,Echidna
Larum: Echidna!
Echidna: Larum? You were all right? Good... If something happened to you, I wouldn’t know what to say to Elffin.
Larum: I’m sorry... If I hadn’t been caught, I could have told you about this earlier...
Echidna: It’s okay. Don’t worry.
Larum: But...
Echidna: Don’t cry over spilled milk. That’s not like you. And besides, I’m all in one piece. So everything’s fine, right?
Larum: ...Yeah.
Echidna: So anyway, who’s the army attacking the castle right now?
Larum: Roy and the Lycia Alliance Army! They came here to defeat the bandits.
Echidna: Lycia, eh? They’ve sure come a long ways to get here... And does it look like they’ll help us out?
Larum: Yeah! They helped me, too.
Echidna: All right, then I guess I’ll join, too! That’s okay, isn’t it?
Larum: Really? That would be great! I’m sure Roy would be glad, too.

@Boss 
Oro: Challenging me...is the equivalent of challenging God Himself. Take your punishment from my hands!

Oro: You…you heathen… I…represent God… Gah…!
 
%Elen,Oro
Elen: You are...a priest, are you not?
Oro: What of it? Anything can go unpunished if done in the name of God! Convenient, is it not?
Elen: ...That’s unforgivable.

%Saul,Oro
Saul: Well, we certainly have an evil bishop here, now, don’t we?
Oro: I am simply living life the way I see fit. Anything can go unpunished if done in the name of God. Convenient, is it not?
Saul: You disgrace God... You shall pay for that!

@End 
Merlinus: Master Roy, there is a young man here to see you. He says he is a member of the rebels...
Roy: I’ll see him. Let him pass.
Elffin: Are you Master Roy? Pleased to meet you, my name is Elffin. I am a member of the rebel forces here.
Roy: I am Roy of the Lycia Alliance Army.
Elffin: You have my thanks for saving our village here.
Roy: No, we simply did what we felt was right.
Elffin: But now you have rebelled against Etruria. Certainly you had thought of that before you took action?
Roy: Of course. As I said, we did what we felt was right. Although what we did is a sign of rebellion against Etruria, if the truth about these islands is made public, they will understand. I have sent a letter to a trustworthy member of the Etrurian court. If she takes the appropriate measures, I think we can tip the tables in our favor.
Elffin: I would not be so sure of that...
Roy: What do you mean?
Elffin: Did you ever think it odd...that Etruria sent you, in particular, to get rid of the bandits?
Roy: Yes... Of course we did.
Elffin: This is merely a theory... But I believe that the ones who requested your help are Advisor Roartz and Lord Arcard.
Roy: ...How do you know that?
Elffin: Why did they have to get your army off the mainland? Could there be some some sort of problem if you stayed in Lycia?
Roy: Oh... I never thought of it that way...
Elffin: There are rumors...that Roartz and Arcard are actually tied in with Bern.
Roy: What!? Then Lycia would be in danger!
Merlinus: M-Master Roy!
Elffin: Your country could be peril. Are you sure you want to be wasting your time on a little island like this?
Merlinus: He’s right! If Bern wanted to get us away from Lycia so they could invade, then we must return at once...
Roy: ...I’m not going back.
Merlinus: What!? Why!?
Elffin: ......
Roy: Right now, it’s very difficult to judge what information is true and what is false. The worst thing to do is is to simply jump to information presented in front of you. Sure, I’m worried about Lycia...but my father is there, and General Cecilia also promised to take care of our land. But our army is the only one stationed on these islands.
Merlinus: That’s true, but...
Roy: If we just leave without fully clearing out the bandits, then what we did so far would all be a lie...
Elffin: ...I see you are blessed with a wise leader.
Roy: What?
Elffin: Master Roy, I am sorry that I tried you so.
Merlinus: Tried us? So what you said was a lie!?
Elffin: I have not lied. But, I did present the rumor in such a way that you would easily jump to it. But Master Roy kept his head. I feel that I would like to serve an individual like you. Master Roy, please count me among your ranks.
Roy: ...I don’t like the idea that you were testing us, but if you’re willing to help, then we will welcome you.
Elffin: Then...
Roy: Yes, please fight alongside us. Well, then, back to business. What can we do to help the people on these isles?
Elffin: We must go to Djuto. The Etrurian capital is there. We must crush it to fully liberate the people.
Roy: All right. We’re going to Djuto! We will fight for the people living here, and to defeat our true enemy!
 
Man: Ah, are you General Roy?
Roy: Yes.
Man: You saved our village. Please take this as a token of our gratitude.
 
Soldier: General Klein, we will stay here and restructure the area, as you directed us.
Klein: Good.
Soldier: We wish we could fight alongside you. Oh, and here, here is the arrow that you had us keep. I will give it back to you. Farewell, and good luck, General Klein.
Klein: Thank you.
 
Soldier: Captain! We will return to Ilia to make our report.
Thea: Thanks.
Soldier: Oh, and this... Your sister gave it to me before we left. Please be careful...
Thea: Thank you. You be careful too.
