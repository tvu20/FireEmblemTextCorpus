@Opening 
After obtaining the Binding Blade, Roy led the Etrurian Army to Castle Bern, where King Zephiel was waiting.

Zephiel, the man responsible for starting this war…

Inside the castle, Zephiel awaited with his personal guards by his side.

Roy prepared to charge the castle. To end this war, and to bring peace to Elibe again…

@Intro 
Zephiel: So... Murdock was defeated...
Brunnya: ...I am sorry.
Zephiel: ...How is the Etrurian Army behaving?
Brunnya: They have captured the Temple of Seals. They are currently headed this way.
Zephiel: I see... Then we shall face them inside this castle.
Brunnya: Yes. I will protect you to the death, your Majesty.
Zephiel: No. Brunnya, I have a very important task for you.
Brunnya: What...?
Zephiel: Idunn. Where is Idunn?
Idunn: ...Here, your Majesty.
Zephiel: I will stay here and defend the castle from the Etrurian Army. Idunn, you must escape and hide until this battle is over.
Idunn: If his Majesty wishes.
Zephiel: Brunnya, I want you to escape as well. Protect Idunn.
Brunnya: What!? Please! Let me fight by your side!
Zephiel: No. ...This will be a harsh battle. I cannot afford to lose Idunn now. If Idunn were lost...this whole war would be meaningless.
Brunnya: But! I, I...!
Zephiel: Enough, Brunnya! This is an order. Are you telling me that you cannot follow your king’s commands?
Brunnya: No... I’m not saying that...
Zephiel: Idunn, even if I fall... I trust you understand.
Idunn: Yes... I will free the world, as you commanded.
Zephiel: Right. I will not give up my dream now.
Idunn: Yes.
 
Hero: The Etrurian Army has come... I will not let you invade the throne room!
 
Hero: I shall protect this device with my life!
 
Roy: This is the king’s castle...
Merlinus: Master Roy, Zephiel is residing in the throne room at the center of the castle. However, there seem to be some special devices that protect the throne room when invaders appear.
Roy: What kind of devices?
Merlinus: One of the captives said that at the west end of the castle, there are switches that need to pulled before one can access the throne room.
Roy: It’ll be a long detour...
Merlinus: There is more. After hitting the switches, you must hold the ‘Gem’ in front of the throne room door to make it open.
Roy: Gem? Is it the Fire Emblem?
Merlinus: Most likely.
Roy: I have that with me. So I should head to the throne room while leaving the switches to the others...
Merlinus: That would be the shortest way.
Roy: ...But would the captives leak that kind of information so easily? Perhaps it’s a trap...
Merlinus: I doubt it, Master Roy. The captive also said, ‘The switches and the door are all defended by Bern’s most powerful warriors. You wouldn’t be able to get to the throne room even if you knew how.'
Roy: We need to try, even if we’re going up against powerful enemies. We’ve gotten strong as well. We won’t lose!

@Battle 
Zephiel: So, you have come. Hmph...how ironic. A child, stepping in my path.
Roy: Zephiel...King of Bern... I will ask you this. Why did you start this war?
Zephiel: ...I wish to end the age of men.
Roy: ...What?
Zephiel: Humans... Humans are filthy. They flock to those with power and would not think twice about betraying trusted allies to obtain more power. You must have witnessed numerous traitors in your travels. Am I right?
Roy: ......
Zephiel: Jealousy. Hate. Greed. Friends, even family members are driven to kill by such ludicrous emotions. Such emotions create fathers who try to kill their own sons to save their own flesh. As long as humans control, as long as humans dictate, as long as humans exist...this madness will never end.
Roy: But look at what you are doing! You are one of those humans who control others!
Zephiel: ...You know how the Scouring ended.
Roy: The Dark Dragon was defeated by Hartmut...
Zephiel: That was the mistake.
Roy: Mistake?
Zephiel: Mankind should not have won. Just because the humans came out victorious, this world came under their control, and transformed into a world of madness and evil, driven by accursed emotions!
Roy: ......
Zephiel: Mistakes must be fixed with haste. I will give the world back to the Dragons. I will free the world from the evil grasp of men. History must be redone from the beginning to save this world from everlasting evil!
Roy: Then...it is true that you resurrected the Dark Dragon.
Zephiel: You may see that for yourself.
Roy: You said you would give the world to the Dragons. Then rule by humans would just be replaced by similar rule by Dragons!
Zephiel: The Dragons you see now are weapons for battle. They have no ‘self.’ They have no cruel emotions to be driven by, unlike foolish humans. The world under the Dragons’ control would be fair and peaceful.
Roy: I cannot agree that such a world would be for the better good! It is true that humans have many evil emotions and do terrible things, but it has always been us humans who have corrected such wrongdoings!
Zephiel: Hmph...you are indeed naive.
Roy: I have faith in mankind. I will not lose to a man who has lost faith in his people and even in himself!

@Boss 
Zephiel: You shall not bar my path!

Zephiel: …So, you have defeated me… But remember… My dream shall never die… As long as…humans retain control…madness will persist…

@End 
Guinevere: Zephiel...
Roy: ...Princess Guinevere.
Guinevere: I’m sorry... Please leave me alone for a while...
Roy: Princess...!
Merlinus: Master Roy... We should let her be.
Elffin: ...Allow me.
Roy: Elffin!
Elffin: Yes?
Roy: ...Thank you. I knew you had your own problems with your own nation... But you helped us. I must thank you...
Elffin: ...I don’t quite understand what you mean...but if I have been helpful, then you are most welcome.
Roy: Yes.
Roy: ...Control over humans by humans...
Merlinus: Zephiel’s words? Perhaps he was right...in a way.
Roy: ...Has the Dark Priestess been found?
Merlinus: No... Apparently she disappeared before the battle.
Roy: I see... Do you think she’s really the Dark Dragon?
Merlinus: I wouldn’t know unless I actually saw her. It’s going to be difficult to find her because she is said to clad in a black robe, and no one has ever seen her up close.
Roy: Oh... But the battle is now over.
Merlinus: What are you saying, Master Roy! The hard part has yet to come. We must help the land recover from the war. There are people out there who need our assistance.
Roy: Right! We have work to do. The real battle may be just beginning.
Merlinus: Yes. We are alive, so we must think about the future.
Roy: No matter what hardships are to come, I will never give up. We have to show that even humans can construct a beautiful and peaceful world!
Merlinus: Master Roy, you will have me at your side, always. Now, let us leave the castle for now. We must spread the word of victory!

^locked
Roy: The king of Bern is finished...
Merlinus: We’ve done it, Master Roy.
Elffin: ...Perhaps it is a bit early to rejoice.
Merlinus: What?
Roy: What do you mean?
Elffin: We still haven’t found the Dark Priestess yet.
Merlinus: Hm, perchance she escaped?
Roy: ......
Merlinus: Wh-What is happening!?
Roy: Zephiel’s sword just flashed! What was its name...
Elffin: Exaccus... A sword that can only be used by the heirs to Bern’s throne...
Merlinus: W-Wait! One of the legends of the Scouring said... When all of the Divine Weapons meet in one place, thus appears the Dragon Temple...
Roy: Dragon Temple...
Merlinus: It was the Dragons’ headquarters during the Scouring, I believe.
Elffin: Yes, that is what the legends say.
Roy: Then the Exaccus was the last Divine Weapon? I thought Hartmut’s sword was the Binding Blade.
Elffin: ...The Binding Blade may be different. Perhaps it is even more powerful than the Divine Weapons...
Roy: More powerful...? What kind of power does this blade possess...?
Merlinus: Master Roy! The sword is glowing again! Look, a beam of light is pointing to the south!
Roy: Does this mean that the Dragon Temple is located where this light is pointing?
Merlinus: If the legends are true, then I would assume that as well.
Elffin: ...If the Dark Priestess is indeed the Dark Dragon... There is a high chance that she is there.
Roy: All right! Let’s go to the Dragon Temple!

@Narration 
And thus, the battle known later as the Great Movement of Bern was resolved.

With Zephiel’s death, Bern surrendered to Etruria. Etruria dismantled its government, but after careful consideration, avoided directly administering its reconstruction.

With Roy’s help, Guinevere took the throne and the New Kingdom of Bern was established. Many of the nobles of Bern expressed their discontent at Guinevere handing over the Fire Emblem to the former enemy, but with her efforts and hard work, she cut open a new path of recovery for Bern.

While the Dark Priestess was never found, peace was restored, and Elibe was set for a new age of prosperity led by Etruria.

Elibe regained its former peace and balance. Centuries after Roy’s time, the nations in Elibe were united under a single flag, but that is another story for another time…
