@Opening 
The coup d’etat at Aquleia quickly spread out to the rest of Etruria. Calling themselves the Revolutionaries, the coup d’etat forces sought to ally with Bern and divide rulership of Elibe.

Cecilia escaped from Aquleia with Guinevere. Forming an anti-coup d’etat militia called the Loyalists, she traveled around Etruria, fighting the Revolutionaries.

However, the Revolutionaries had Bern on their side. With King Mordred taken hostage, Great General Douglas and Knight General Percival were also forced to join the Revolutionaries. With these powerful allies, the Revolutionaries slowly began to push the Loyalists out of Etruria. Eventually, the Loyalists were driven into an old castle on Misul Peninsula.

After locating Cecilia, Roy headed for Misul. Meanwhile, the Loyalists were under joint attack by the Revolutionaries and Bern’s troops. It would only be a matter of time before the Loyalists were defeated…

@Intro 
Narcian: Flaer! Hasn’t the castle gone down yet!?
Flaer: General Narcian, the Loyalists led by General Cecilia are fighting harder than we had anticipated...
Narcian: Cecilia...! That bitch again! Always interfering with my plans...!
Zephiel: I see you are having trouble, Narcian.
Idunn: ......
Narcian: Y-Your Majesty!? When...did you arrive?
Zephiel: Just now. The general from Etruria fights well, I see.
Narcian: Y-Yes... But fear not, I shall force her into submission...
Zephiel: No, let me. I will fight her myself.
Idunn: Your Majesty, there is no reason for you to fight...
Zephiel: No matter, I need the exercise. Narcian, show me to her.
 
Roy: What’s the story?
Merlinus: The castle hasn’t fallen yet, Master Roy.
Roy: Good! But we still have to hurry.

@Battle
Zephiel: So... You are Cecilia, the Sorcery General.
Cecilia: !! ...King Zephiel...
Zephiel: For your prowess in battle, you have the honor to fight me one on one.
Cecilia: ... !!
Cecilia: Too...powerful...
Zephiel: Down already? I would have expected more.
Narcian: Your Majesty! Invincible as always.
Zephiel: I suppose this is all one can expect from an Etrurian General.
Narcian: Your Majesty... If you would allow it, may I have her?
Zephiel: Hm?
Narcian: I have some certain...bad memories with this woman. I want to punish her for them.
Zephiel: Hmph, very well. Do with her as you wish.
Narcian: Thank you very much, Your Majesty. You there, make one of the prison cells ready.
Soldier: Yes, General Narcian.

Percival: What? Bern is attacking the castle?
Soldier: Yes, General Percival.
Percival: ...This isn’t what they promised. They said that they would leave Etrurian matters to us Etrurians.
Soldier: What should we do?
Percival: Was it General Narcian who commanded the attack?
Soldier: No, sir. It was King Zephiel himself.
Percival: ! The king himself... So, Bern had no intention of entrusting anything to us in the first place... We aren’t going to move right now. Tell everyone to remain at their posts.
Soldier: Yes, sir.
 
Roy: The castle fell?
Merlinus: Yes... We were too late.
Roy: Is General Cecilia all right?
Merlinus: There is no report that she was killed, but probably...
Roy: Well, if there’s still a possibility that she’s alive, then I won’t give up. We have to hurry!

Narcian: Your Majesty! We have found Princess Guinevere.
Zephiel: Bring her to me.
Guinevere: Zephiel...
Zephiel: Guinevere. So good to see you.
Guinevere: Zephiel, why? Why did you start this war... Why are you killing innocent people?
Zephiel: Innocent, you say? Hmph, jealousy, vanity, greed... People have been fighting over such rubbish in any nation. And you call them innocent?
Guinevere: Well...
Zephiel: The world must liberated from such pointless things that men fight over. That is the purpose of this war.
Guinevere: But...people are being brutally killed in the process.
Zephiel: No radical change can come about without sacrifice.
Guinevere: Zephiel...!
Zephiel: Guinevere, you are my only sister. Therefore, I will forgive you this time. But not the next. Do you understand?
Guinevere: ......
Zephiel: Narcian! Wasn’t the leader of Guinevere’s guards here?
Narcian: Yes. Her name is Melady.
Zephiel: Very well. Tell her to escort Guinevere back to Bern. Also tell her to make sure that the Fire Emblem is returned to the Temple of Seals.
Narcian: Yes, Your Majesty.
Guinevere: Zephiel...

Guinevere: Melady...
Melady: Princess Guinevere, I am glad to see you safe. Now, let us return to Bern on my mount... ...Princess?
Guinevere: Melady!
Melady: Wh-What are you doing!? Please put down that sword before you are hurt!
Guinevere: Melady, please! Let me go.
Melady: ! ...Should I oblige, what would you do next?
Guinevere: ...I understand that Roy of the Lycia Alliance Army is near here...
Melady: !? You would join the enemy!?
Guinevere: If we don’t do something, Elibe will be overrun by Bern’s forces... No matter what kind of reasoning my brother gives, what he is doing is obvious. He is forcing others into submission through power. I cannot agree that that will lead to anything good...
Melady: ......
Guinevere: Melady... Please. Let me go.
Melady: ...There is one thing...
Guinevere: ?
Melady: There is one thing that I cannot forgive you for, Princess. When you left Bern earlier, why did you not come to consult me...?
Guinevere: Well... I thought that your reputation would be damaged, so...
Melady: ! Did you think that I would prioritize my reputation above you? I am your loyal knight more than I am a knight of Bern. That has not changed ever since I was knighted.
Guinevere: Melady...
Melady: If you told me to let you go, then I would follow your order with pleasure.
Guinevere: Melady... Thank you.
 
Melady: Please, halt your attacks! I am not an enemy!
Roy: What? Everyone, lower your weapons!
Merlinus: Master Roy, she may be lying...
Roy: She may be a messenger. Killing a messenger goes against the knight’s code.
Merlinus: ......
Melady: Are you General Roy?
Roy: ...Yes. And you are?
Guinevere: Roy!
Roy: Princess Guinevere!? You were safe.
Guinevere: Yes... I escaped with her assistance.
Melady: My name is Melady.
Guinevere: Roy, General Cecilia is alive.
Roy: R-Really?
Guinevere: Yes, she is alive, although she is severely wounded. She is being held captive in the castle.
Roy: Thank you! We have to rescue her!

Zephiel: Are they ready?
Idunn: Yes. The Dragons are prepared to fight at your command.
Zephiel: Narcian, I will give you some Dragons to fortify your militia. I want you to send some of your forces to Nabata.
Narcian: Nabata? The desert lands located at the center of this peninsula?
Zephiel: Right. I hear that there is a hidden village in which Dragons have been staying ever since the Scouring.
Narcian: I see... Then there is a high chance that a Divine Weapon is hidden there.
Zephiel: Exactly. It must not fall into the hands of the enemy. I already sent some troops to start the attack, but they are outnumbered.
Narcian: Understood, Your Majesty. I shall send some mercenaries and Dragons there at once.
Zephiel: Good. You can also take the girl we captured in Nabata. She’s a Shaman from the hidden village. You can pry more information out of her if you need to.
Narcian: Yes, Your Majesty. I shall have the village taken in no time.
Zephiel: ...I shall remember those words.
Narcian: Of course!
 
Cecilia: ...Oh... Where am I... ...!
Sophia: You’re still not well... You shouldn’t move...
Cecilia: Did you treat my wounds?
Sophia: ...Yes... But I’m not...used to treating wounds... Perhaps...I didn’t do a good job...
Cecilia: Yes, you did. Thank you. We must find a way out of here... ...Ow...!
Sophia: You shouldn’t move... The wound...will open again...
Cecilia: But I must do something...
Sophia: It will be all right... I can see...a light...that will soon be here to help us...
Cecilia: Light?
Sophia: Yes... That light...will aid us both... We must wait for it...
Cecilia: Who are you...?
Sophia: I am Sophia... A priestess of Arcadia...
Cecilia: Arcadia?
Sophia: I shall tell you more about it...later... For now...please trust me...
 
Soldier: Yes, what is it, General Percival?
Percival: We’re leaving.
Soldier: What? Are you sure?
Percival: Bern’s behavior is clearly an act of insult to Etruria. I cannot aid Bern any further. We will return to Aquleia and inform Lord Douglas of this matter. Retreat at once!
Soldier: Yes, sir!

Flaer: General Narcian! It’s them! The Lycia Alliance Army!
Narcian: What!? Flaer! I thought you had taken care of them at Djuto!
Flaer: I did! Well...I left a Dragon to deal with them, so... I never thought that they had survived!
Narcian: What!? You fool, then my reputation as your officer is also in jeopardy! If I let the Lycia Alliance Army live here, people will start to suspect my ability... I must do something... ...But, they defeated a Dragon. They seem to be tougher than I expected.
Flaer: General Narcian... What should we do...?
Narcian: I have no choice... Flaer, I will return to Aquleia and plan an attack on the Alliance Army. You stay here.
Flaer: ! M-Me... Stay here?
Narcian: You don’t have to defeat them. I just want you to hit them as hard as you can and decrease their numbers.
Flaer: General Narcian! You would use me as a cannon-fodder!?
Narcian: Flaer... To tell you the truth, you would have been executed a long time ago when you failed to defend Djuto. I’m giving you a chance to prove your worth again. You should be grateful. Hehehe...
Flaer: But!
Narcian: Or do you want me to carry out your execution right here?
Flaer: ...! ...Yes...sir... Understood.
Narcian: Good. Then I’ll leave the rest to you.

@Recruit-Talk 
%Elffin,Percival
Elffin: Percival. It is good to see you again.
Percival: !! You...
Elffin: Have you forgotten my face?
Percival: No...it cannot be. The prince...is dead.
Elffin: ...I understand your confusion. After all, a man who was pronounced dead is now standing before your very eyes.
Percival: Prince Mildain! You were alive...?
Elffin: I have troubled you for a long time now. ...It has been over a year since I was assassinated.
Percival: Assassinated!? Your Majesty, did you not fall off your horse in an accident?
Elffin: No. I was shot with a poisoned arrow. First to my horse...and then to me.
Percival: No...
Elffin: Douglas noticed first and made it public that I had been killed. A different corpse was placed in the coffin, and everything was set up as if the assassination had been successful. Douglas then entrusted me to his adopted daughter and let me escape to the Western Isles.
Percival: Lord Douglas did that...
Elffin: Even after I escaped to the west, I suffered from a high fever caused by the poison for many months. I was hovering between life and death so long that Douglas’ daughter gave up hope countless times.
Percival: ......
Elffin: The rebel forces helped me by giving me medicine. Ironic, isn’t it? The very rebels who were fighting against the Etrurian court had saved the life the prince himself!
Percival: ......
Elffin: I recovered...slowly. And then I saw the horrors being committed by the Etrurian nobles on the Isles. I was ashamed that I had not noticed when I was still residing on the throne.
Percival: Your Majesty...
Elffin: While aiding the rebels, I was looking for a chance to return to the mainland. Then General Roy came along, and I saw my chance. And that is how I ended up here.
Percival: Prince... I am truly thankful that you returned alive.
Elffin: I am with the Lycia Alliance Army right now, but I still must hide my true identity. And if I still have the loyalty that you pledged to me in the past...
Percival: I am at your service, Your Majesty. My master is only one, and he is you, Prince Mildain.

%Larum,Percival
Larum: General Percival! It is you, isn’t it? I was looking for you! I am...
Larum: Wait! Wait! Stop your horse! Listen to me!
Percival: Who are you?
Larum: Don’t you know!? I thought we’d met before.
Percival: ...I sort of recall seeing you at Lord Douglas’ manor...
Larum: Yes! That’s me. You do know me, then!
Percival: But the girl I saw there was a little more...ordinary.
Larum: What’s that supposed to mean? Ah, no matter. Anyway, my name is Larum. I’m here under the command of Prince Mildain.
Percival: Prince Mildain...? Don’t be daft. The prince was killed in an accident the year before.
Larum: Well... Look at this!
Percival: !! That emblem... It belongs to the prince...!
Larum: Now do I have your attention? Then take a look at this letter, too. The prince told me to give it to you.
Percival: ...... This is the prince’s handwriting... So he is alive! Then I hesitate no more. If the prince has joined the Lycia Alliance Army, then I must do the same.
Larum: Wha-? That was quick... I was hoping things to get more dramatic... Like, ‘If you’re still going to stand against us, then you’re going to cut me down first!’ or something like that...

@Boss 
Flaer: Damn…! But I am a knight of Bern! I shall never surrender!

Flaer: Remember this… There are…plenty of warriors greater than I… Bern’s army shall annihilate you…for sure…

@End 
Roy: General Cecilia!
Cecilia: Roy... I have made a fool out of myself in front of you.
Roy: No, of course not! I am relieved that you are alive... But what of your wounds? Are you all right?
Cecilia: Yes. This girl treated them for me.
Roy: And you are?
Sophia: I am Sophia... A priestess of Arcadia...
Cecilia: She prophesized that you would be coming. Now, you said you would tell us more once we were safe...
Sophia: Yes... Arcadia...our home...lies to the east...in the Nabata Desert... We tried to stay hidden...but Bern found us... And...
Roy: They attacked you?
Sophia: Yes... I was too slow...so I was captured...
Roy: I see... But why would Bern be interested in a little hidden village like yours?
Sophia: I...do not know... Perhaps...they found out...about the Dragons that live in Arcadia...
Roy: Dragons!?
Sophia: Yes... Arcadia...was built a long time ago...by Dragons and people who wished to live together...
Roy: Such a place existed...?
Sophia: Master Roy... Please, save our village...!
Merlinus: But the story does seem a bit unbelievable...
Sophia: ......
Roy: ...In any case, it’s probably true that her village is under attack by Bern. We should help them. We owe Sophia anyway because she helped General Cecilia.
Sophia: ...Thank you...
Roy: Then, can you tell us more about your village and the Dragons?
Sophia: Yes... I will gladly tell you what I know...
 
Soldier: General Percival, until further instructions are given, we will station ourselves in this castle and prepare for further attacks from the Revolutionaries.
Percival: Good.
Soldier: Here, we found this in the castle. Please take it. General Percival, please take care...of Etruria.
Percival: I know. Leave it to me.
Soldier: Yes!
