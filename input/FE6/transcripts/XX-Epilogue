Lilina: Princess Guinevere is to be crowned today.
Roy: I haven’t see her in her royal garments yet. She must be beautiful beyond words. Even when I first saw her, I couldn’t believe that such a beautiful woman could exist.
Lilina: Yes.
Roy: But the Princess’ hardships are still to come.
Lilina: What?
Roy: Even if she becomes queen of Bern with Etruria’s help, I’m sure that there’ll be a lot of rebellion and unrest.
Lilina: Do you think so?
Roy: I think that there might be people who’ll say that Princess Guinevere joined Etruria just to seize the throne. She’ll have to face them.
Lilina: ...But I think Princess Guinevere will be fine. And then Bern will become a much better nation than before... She’s just so smart...and strong.
Roy: Yeah... I think so, too.
Lilina: ...What are you going to do now?
Roy: Me? I’ll return to Pherae. I’m worried about my father’s illness, and we’ll have to start rebuilding the lands that were trampled upon by the war.
Lilina: Um...I...
Roy: What?
Lilina: Uh... Nothing. So you’re returning to Pherae...
Roy: What about you? You’re going back to Ostia, right?
Lilina: ...Yes. I must take my father’s place.
Roy: I’m glad to hear that you’ll be staying is Ostia.
Lilina: ...Why?
Roy: Because if you’re Ostia, then I can go meet you any time I want.
Lilina: What...
Roy: Lilina... I don’t know when, but some day... I’ll go pick you up.
Lilina: ...I... I have to prepare, too... But... Roy... I always...
Roy: Oh! The ceremony’s starting. Come on, Lilina, we have to go see Princess... I mean, Queen Guinevere and pay our respects!
Lilina: So...I always... ...What!? R-Roy, wait for me!

Roy: Princess Guinevere, congratulations on your crowning.
Guinevere: Yes... But my battle is only about to begin.
Roy: I’m sorry... I had to rely on Etruria to fulfill my task.
Guinevere: No, I am grateful. However, I think that there will be people who will that I joined Etruria just to seize the throne.
Roy: Princess...
Guinevere: But the most important thing now is to rebuild Bern. I will try my best to gain the people’s trust by bringing Bern back to life. No matter how long it takes...
Roy: If there is anything I can do to help, please don’t hesitate to ask.
Guinevere: Thank you. Some day, I might. Roy, are you...
Roy: Yes?
Guinevere: What are you going to do? Will you remain in the Etrurian Army?
Roy: No, I will return to Pherae. I’m worried about my father’s illness, and we will have to start rebuilding the lands that were trampled upon by the war.
Guinevere: You are returning to your homeland? That is just like you. Still... Someone of your ability could easily aim for high power in the Etrurian Court.
Roy: M-Me!? No no no, I have no such ability!
Guinevere: Pherae’s people are fortunate to have such a gifted leader as you.
Soldier: Princess... I mean, your Majesty...
Guinevere: Guinevere is fine. What is the matter?
Soldier: Yes, Lady Guinevere. The ceremony is about to begin!
Guinevere: Thank you. I will be there shortly.
Guinevere: Roy, will you come with me?
Roy: Me?
Guinevere: Ever since I left Bern with the Fire Emblem, you have helped me tremendously. So I want you to see me crowned... I want you to see with your own eyes what path Bern will take under my leadership.
Roy: Of course. I shall be glad to accompany you.
Guinevere: Then...
Roy: Let us go see a new Bern...and a new age.

@Narration
And thus, the battle known as the Great Movement of Bern was resolved.

After Bern’s surrender, Etruria dismantled its government, but after careful consideration, avoided directly
administering its reconstruction. With Roy’s help, Guinevere took the throne and the New Kingdom of Bern was established. And on the day of her crowning…the long months of war came to a close…

Thus regaining its former peace and balance, Elibe was blessed with a new Golden Age of prosperity. Filled with sorrow, hatred, and revenge…the epic battle which determined the fate of Elibe was finally about to end…

Elibe regained its former peace and balance. Centuries after Roy’s time, the nations in Elibe were united under a single flag, but that is another story for another time…

Elder: Ah, Master Roy. It has been a long time.
Roy: I had business in these areas, so I decided to stop by on the way.
Elder: Fa will be glad to see you.
Roy: I saw her earlier. She is as energetic as ever.
Elder: She is being allowed outside more often these days. Perhaps that is why.
Roy: How is the girl that I sent here doing?
Elder: We succeeded in restoring her soul, but...
Roy: ...She still won’t go back to normal?
Elder: Fa sometimes takes her outside, but she won’t try to do anything on her own.
Roy: I see...
Elder: Master Roy... We knew that the girl you sent here was captured by the Dragons. Still, we did not try and rescue her. We feared that our kind would be in danger if we showed ourselves in front of the other Dragons again. But now, I wonder whether my judgment was correct.
Roy: ......
Elder: Perhaps it is because we have begun to live with humans. I will make my best efforts to bring back the girl’s heart fully.
Roy: ...Thank you.
Elder: As a first, I would like to see some kind of sign that her emotions are working... Perhaps laughing or crying...anything...

Fa: And that is called a tree!
Idunn: Tree...
Fa: Right! And that tree gives yummy fruit!
Idunn: Fruit?
Fa: Yes. Can you see? It’s up at the top. And if you shake the tree like this...
Fa: Oww! It fell on Fa’s head...
Idunn: Hahaha!
Fa: ...? Did you just laugh?
Idunn: ...Laugh? Me?
Fa: Yeah! You just laughed! Yes! You laughed!
Idunn: Laugh...? This is to laugh?
Fa: Where’s Roy? Roy! Fa has to tell Roy that Idunn laughed!
Idunn: A warm...breeze...
