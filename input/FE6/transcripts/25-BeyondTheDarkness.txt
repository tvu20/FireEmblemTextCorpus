@Intro 
Roy: You’re the Dark Priestess... No, the Dark Dragon.
Idunn: ...Why do you hinder my path?
Roy: What...?
Idunn: I have been commanded to lead this world. I shall make the world a better place. Why do you stand in my way?
Roy: ...You’re wrong. You were only told that the world would become a better place. The person who ordered you is already dead. So stop! You no longer have any reason to fight!
Idunn: ......
Roy: You... No, we... We have no reason to fight.
Idunn: ...A long time ago... I have a feeling that I heard those same words. Soft words, like a warm breeze... But that was long ago... I have been asleep for too long. In the darkness, I was dreaming... An empty dream, white, colorless... But now I am awake. His Majesty willed me so.
Roy: Majesty... Zephiel!
Idunn: I have woken. I am no longer who I used to be. I now clearly understand what I must do.
Roy: ......
Idunn: I must lead this world... No matter how many days or nights pass, I must. I must...
Roy: You insist on fighting us?
Idunn: If you stand in my path...
Roy: Such strong...will...
Idunn: His Majesty wishes it to be. And I was woken to answer his Majesty’s calls.

@Boss 
Idunn: I...I... Gah... I...alone... Dark... Alone... in... darkness...

@End 
Roy: What’s happening... The temple is starting to collapse! Everyone! Hurry outside!
Merlinus: Master Roy! Are you all right!?
Roy: Yes... But the temple is gone.
Merlinus: It is over a thousand years old, and a lot of energy was released in the battles that we just fought. Probably the building couldn’t withstand it.
Roy: I see...
Merlinus: Well, Master Roy, this is the end.
Roy: No, it’s not over yet. This is just the beginning. We have to help the land and the people recover from the war. We have much work to do. The real battle is just starting!

Fa: Ah!
Roy: What’s happening... The temple is starting to collapse! Everyone! Hurry outside!
Fa: Roy...
Roy: I know. Leave the rest to me. Now go!
Merlinus: Master Roy! Are you all right!?
Roy: Yes... But the temple is gone.
Merlinus: It is over a thousand years old, and a lot of energy was released in the battles that we just fought. Probably the building couldn’t withstand it.
Roy: I see...
Merlinus: So, times are changing again. And... Who is that you are carrying on your back?
Roy: Her? Oh, right. Merlinus, I need to ask you something...
