@Opening
In the hidden village Arcadia stands an ancient temple.  One of the Divine
Weapons is said to be hidden in it.

Roy and company were quick to follow Bern's troops, who had already found their
way into the temple...

@Intro 
Ohtz: Haven’t you found the Divine Weapon yet!?
Soldier: We think it is inside this altar, but it won’t open...
Ohtz: Break it open, then! We don’t have much time.
Soldier: But we must also deal with the enemies that have entered the temple! We don’t have enough manpower to use force on the altar.
Ohtz: Very well, defeat the enemy first! Then we shall examine the altar with leisure.
 
Roy: This is the underground of the desert? There’s so much...water.
Sophia: This is close...to a large source of groundwater... That is why...plants and animals can live near here...
Roy: I see, so that’s why you were able to build a village here. Still, how did you find such a convenient place like this?
Sophia: Athos... Archsage Athos is the one...who led us here...
Roy: What? Do you mean Athos of the Eight Heroes?
Sophia: Yes... After the Scouring...Athos traveled around Elibe... At the end of his journey, he arrived at our village...in which men and Dragons were living in harmony... But he said that...it would only be a matter of time before we were found...
Roy: So he led you here...
Sophia: Yes... And he hid his Divine Weapon...inside this temple...
Roy: Can we use his Divine Weapon?
Sophia: Yes... Athos told us...to use his weapon to protect Arcadia... And your fight against Bern...will lead to our safety...
Roy: All right. Thanks.
Sophia: Some of the temple’s passages...may suddenly sink into the water... Please be careful...

@Boss 
Ohtz: I…wasn’t expecting you to fight so well against all of us.

Ohtz: Where…did you learn to fight…like this…

@End 
Sophia: The Divine Weapon is here...inside this altar...
Roy: ... It won’t open.
Sophia: This altar is made...so that only those of the village may open it... Please allow me...
Roy: Okay.
Sophia: ...... Here... This is the Divine Weapon...
Roy: Athos’ Divine Weapon? Then...
Sophia: Yes... The Infernal Element...Foreblaze...
 
Elder of Arcadia: Who are you? How did you enter here?
Roy: My name is Roy. I came with Sophia to protect this village.
Elder: With Sophia...? Then it was you who drove off Bern’s soldiers? Oh... Please forgive my impudence. I am the Elder of Arcadia.
Roy: Elder... Then are you the Dragon?
Elder: Dragon... They once called me that. But that is a story of a time long since past.
Roy: ......
Elder: Let me see... The only real Dragon we have is Fa right here.
Fa: Hi...
Roy: This little girl is a Dragon?
Elder: Yes, although she is far from her mature form.
Roy: Elder, do you know anything about the Dragons in Bern?
Elder: What! There are Dragons in Bern?
Roy: Yes, we have seen them.
Elder: Why...? Dragons do not exist anywhere except here.
Igrene: Elder, if I may.
Elder: What is it, Igrene?
Igrene: Sophia said that she could detect evil energy coming from Bern’s troops. That may have something to do with the Dragons Master Roy says he saw in Bern’s army.
Elder: Perhaps... But I am too old to detect such energy now.
Roy: Energy? What is that?
Elder: Sophia is half Dragon, half human. That gives her the ability to detect the pulses emitted from other Dragons. But because she can’t detect them clearly, she only said that she felt a force...twisted and unnatural.
Igrene: I think that we should look into it. Elder, if you would allow it, I would like to join Master Roy and look at Bern’s Dragons myself.
Elder: I really do not want to deal with matters of the outside... But this is a time of emergency. Well then, Roy, will you take her?
Roy: Certainly.
Igrene: I am Igrene, the Guardian of Nabata. I have confidence in my skills with the bow. I believe I may be of some help in battle.
Roy: Thank you.
Fa: Fa’s going, too!
Elder: What are you saying? Of course you may not. There is no telling what could happen if your existence were exposed to the world!
Fa: ......
Roy: Well then, let’s go.
Igrene: Yes.
Fa: ...Fine... Fa will just follow them anyway!
