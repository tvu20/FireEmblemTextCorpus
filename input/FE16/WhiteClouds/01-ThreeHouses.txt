@Opening 
The icy winds of the Oghma Mountains have begun to scatter, and the verdant fields once again spring to life across Fódlan, heralding the start of a new year. As they celebrate the dawning year, the people pray that they may realize their full potential, just as a tiny sprout hopes to one day grow into a great tree.

The continent of Fódlan, said to be protected by a revered goddess, has existed since time immemorial. Three ruling powers now control the land. In the south lies a region long held by a more than one-thousand-year-old dynasty–the Adrestian Empire. Beyond its borders, to the frigid north, is the home of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, ruled by the royal family and its knights. To the east, a league of nobles that heeds no king nor emperor rules what is called the Leicester Alliance. Once consumed by a tempest of war and turmoil, Fódlan and these three mighty powers now exist in relative harmony.

@Cutscene 
Dimitri: This will be your first time at the monastery. I’d be happy to show you around.
Claude: It really is Fódlan in a nutshell. The good and the bad.
Edelgard: Like it or not, we’ll be there soon enough.

Edelgard: There it is. Garreg Mach Monastery.

Jeralt: Rhea's here.

Rhea: I wonder... Did the flow of time bring you here?

@Dialogue 
Jeralt: It's been years since I've last set eyes on this place. To be forced to see her now...
Byleth: Her?
Jeralt: You saw her in the courtyard earlier, didn't you? The archbishop...Lady Rhea.
Byleth: You've been here before?
Jeralt: I've never spoken of this to you before, but...many years ago, I was a knight here. I reported to the archbishop...Lady Rhea.
Byleth: The archbishop?
Byleth: Lady Rhea?
Jeralt: As you know, the majority of folks in Fódlan are devout followers of the teachings of Seiros. The leader of that ridiculously large religious organization is the archbishop, Lady Rhea.

Seteth: Thank you for your patience, Jeralt. My name is Seteth. I am an advisor to the archbishop.
Jeralt: Right. Hello.
Rhea: It has been a long time, Jeralt. I wonder…was it the will of the goddess that we have another chance meeting like this?
Jeralt: Forgive my silence all these years. Much has happened since we last spoke.
Rhea: So I see. The miracle of fatherhood has blessed you. That is your child, is it not?
Jeralt: Yes...born many years after I left this place. I wish I could introduce you to the mother of my child...but I’m afraid we lost her to illness.
Rhea: I see. My condolences. As for you…I heard of your valiant efforts from Alois. What is your name?

Byleth: My name is... 
Rhea: A fine name indeed.
Byleth: ...
Seteth: You must at least show the basic courtesy of telling us your name! Do you not think you are being a bit rude to the archbishop?
Rhea: It is all right, Seteth. My dear, I am called Rhea. I am the archbishop of the Church of Seiros. In truth, I was only being polite. I already know your name. And a fine name it is.
Rhea: From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for saving those students of the Officers Academy.
Jeralt: Hmph.
Rhea: Jeralt. You already know what it is I wish to say, do you not?
Jeralt: You want me to rejoin the Knights of Seiros, don’t you. I won’t say no, but…
Rhea: Your apprehension stings. I had expected that Alois would have already asked this of you. I must step away for now, but I expect they will desire a word with you soon. Please listen carefully to what they have to say. Until tomorrow… Farewell.

@Dialogue 
Jeralt: I can’t believe it. Forced back into the Knights of Seiros. I’m sorry I dragged you into this. Looks like I’ll be stuck here for a while…and I’m afraid your services are requested as well.
 
Byleth: As a mercenary?
Byleth: As a servant?
Jeralt: Nothing like that. They want you to teach, by the sound of it. You heard those brats earlier talking about the Officers Academy, right? Well, the academy just happens to be short a professor. And apparently that damned Alois went and recommended you to Lady Rhea.

Manuela: So. You must be the new professor. My, how stern and handsome you are!
Jeralt: Er, no. I’m not the one you’re looking for. You can handle things from here. Good luck.  And…watch out for Lady Rhea. I don’t know what she’s thinking, making you a professor like this. She may be up to something. Stay on your guard.

Manuela: Oh. It's you, then? So young...
Hanneman: Competence and age are not necessarily correlated, as you well know. I am Hanneman, a Crest scholar and professor at the Officers Academy. I wonder if you bear a Crest of your own. When next you have a moment to spare, I insist that you pay me a visit so we can delve into the subject further.
Manuela: I’m Manuela. I’m a professor, a physician, a songstress, and available. It’s nice to meet you.

Byleth: You're a physician?
Manuela: I look too pretty for that line of work, do I? But yes, when I’m not teaching, I can be found in the infirmary. If you’re ever lonely, please do come and pay me a visit. I would love to–
Byleth: "You're a songstress?" 
Manuela: Of course. Before I came here, I belonged to a renowned opera company. Perhaps you've heard of me? The Mittelfrank Opera Company's beautiful, peerless–
Hanneman: Spare our colleague the needless chatter, Manuela. Now then, it seems you’ll be taking charge of one of the academy’s three houses. I expect you haven’t yet been briefed on the nature of each, have you?
Manuela: Do you really not know? Fine, I’ll do you a favor and explain. The Officers Academy is comprised of three houses of students, each of which is closely affiliated with its region of origin. The Black Eagle House is for students from the Adrestian Empire. Their house leader this year is Edelgard, the Imperial princess, who is in line to be the next emperor.
Hanneman: The Blue Lion House is for students from the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus. Their house leader this year is Prince Dimitri. He is to be the next king of Faerghus.
Manuela: Lastly, there is the Golden Deer House, which is for students of the Leicester Alliance. Their house leader is Claude, grandson to Duke Riegan, the leader of the Alliance.
Hanneman: To think that the next emperor, king and sovereign duke are all here. It certainly is a promising year for the academy.
Manuela: I’ll say. I just hope none of those little treasures cause any trouble.
Hanneman: Hm, quite. For now, I suggest taking a stroll around the academy to get your bearings. And when you’ve a moment, please stop by my research laboratory.
Manuela: The old man has a point. Oh, and keep in mind that I’ve only notified the house leaders that you’re our new professor. It’s more fun that way. I suggest you try spending time with the students. Some odd ducks in that bunch, but they’re good kids. I’m sure Lady Rhea will have more information for you tomorrow, but that should get you going. Good luck. You’ll need it.

Seteth: Have you no intention of changing your mind, Rhea? Appointing a stranger–a child no less!–as a professor at our esteemed academy is–
Rhea: I have made my decision, Seteth. I know worrying comes naturally to you, but there is truly no need. That “stranger” is Jeralt’s flesh and blood, after all.
Seteth: I can’t say that’s all too comforting. How trustworthy is this Jeralt character? Is he not the man who went missing after the great fire 21 years ago? I would remind you that Flayn is now here with us as well. I beg of you…please consider whether this is an unnecessary risk.
Rhea: Seteth. They have my trust. Let that be enough for you as well. More importantly, I have received a report from Shamir. I am increasingly concerned about a matter regarding our suspicious individual. We cannot ignore those who harbor ill will towards the church, especially if they are frequenting Garreg Mach.
Seteth: Yes, that matter is of great importance as well. I shall continue my investigation. Rhea… For now, I will have faith that you are placing your trust with the utmost care. I pray that nothing occurs to shake that confidence.

@Conversation
Rhea: I assume you are already aware that you will be teaching here at the Officers Academy. Correct? To start, please speak with the three house leaders. You should also take a look around the academy and acquaint yourself with your new home. That is your first task here at the monastery. Please let me know if you accept it. Once you have finished, come and speak with me.

Rhea: You should speak with every student you can. This might be your only chance to see what they're really like before you become a professor...
Rhea:  You are responsible for choosing which house to lead. If there are still students you have yet to speak with, try visiting each house's homeroom.

Alois: Ha! I imagine you were a bit surprised that I recommended you as a professor here. Frankly, we had someone else in mind for the role, but they ran off during our dustup with the bandits. Can't entrust students to someone who's abandoned them once before, huh?

Seteth: You saved the lives of the students you came across. That, at least, was admirable. Now, you should make the rounds. Go around the monastery and see that you greet everyone.

Edelgard: So you've accepted a teaching position here... Pity. I was hoping you would lend your strength to the Empire. I never properly introduced myself, did I? My name is Edelgard von Hresvelg. I am the princess and heir apparent to the Adrestian Empire. I wonder if you'll be tasked with leading the Black Eagles... I hope you've had a chance to meet everyone. Would you like to know more about any of the Black Eagles?
Byleth: Yes.
Edelgard: Me? Well...some think I'm a bit distant. Arrogant, even. But there's little to be done. One day, I must rise to become Adrestia's next emperor. What else... Well, it seems to me that we may have similar personalities.
Edelgard: Hubert is the heir of Marquis Vestra. He has served me since I was a child. You may think his blood runs a bit cold, but... Heh, actually, that's rather accurate. Still, if you can get past that, you'll see he's quite astute and reasonable.
Edelgard: For some reason, he thinks of me as a bitter rival and is always trying to challenge me. It's terribly irritating. His house is that of Duke Aegir, which produces Adrestia's Prime Ministers. That family is...perhaps too pleased with its own status.
Edelgard: He's remarkably intelligent, but he only wishes to apply himself to tasks that particularly interest him and nothing else. He's also fond of...well, napping. If he had any work ethic or sense of duty to speak of, I suppose he would be destined to become an official of the Empire.
Edelgard: He's the second son of Count Bergliez. He has no inheritance in his future, which is perhaps why he's always so eager to prove himself. He's overly energetic and rushes headfirst into any battle. If he ends up in your care, be sure to keep a close eye on him.
Edelgard: She's Count Varley's only daughter. I suppose you could say she's a bit eccentric, but she seems like a gentle soul. I believe she's shut herself away in her quarters and doesn't care to leave, but...don't worry. I'll make sure she finds her way to class.
Edelgard: Few commoners have joined the Black Eagle House, but Dorothea is an exception. She's a songstress from a famous opera company in the Empire. I'm not entirely sure what brought her to the Officers Academy.
Edelgard: To the west of Fódlan is an archipelago called Brigid. Petra is the granddaughter of their king. Brigid is a vassal state of the Empire, which is how she came to be enrolled here. She's incredibly smart and studious.

Dimitri: Please accept my apologies for the other day. You came to our aid, yet I hadn't even the courtesy to properly introduce myself. I am Dimitri Alexandre Blaiddyd, crown prince of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus. Of course, at the academy I am simply a student. And I've heard word that you are to become a professor here. Delightful news. I still have much to learn, but I'm confident I could benefit greatly from your guidance. In any case, welcome to the monastery. I hear you're investigating the different houses. Did any of the Blue Lions catch your attention?
Byleth: Yes. 
Dimitri: Me? Oh. Um. Please forgive me... It's difficult to open up on the spot, don't you think? I'm afraid my story has not been a pleasant one... I do hope that doesn't color your view of me, but I understand if that can't be helped.
Dimitri: Dedue was born in Duscur, and has been loyally working in my service for the past four years. He's rather taciturn, but once you get to know him, you'll see he's a kind and good-natured young man.
Dimitri: Felix is the heir to House Fraldarius. He has a bit of a sharp tongue, but don't let that fool you. Deep down, he's a good guy. He gravitates towards people who are skilled. Perhaps you would enjoy a friendly competition with him sometime.
Dimitri: He's the adoptive son of Lord Lonato of Castle Gaspard, but I hear he was born a commoner. He has an extremely earnest personality, so I'm certain he will approach your lectures with great enthusiasm.
Dimitri: Sylvain is the heir to House Gautier. He is a capable person who highly values his friends. That said... Well, he's always been a bit of a...ahem, skirt chaser, so to speak. Pardon my bluntness. I speak with him about it often, but it doesn't seem to help.
Dimitri: I hear she was born to Imperial nobility, but a twist of fate brought her to the Kingdom. She may seem carefree on the surface, but she's actually a kind soul who pays careful attention to everyone around her.
Dimitri: Annette is Baron Dominic's niece. She is a talented student who scored extremely high marks at the Royal School of Sorcery. She's cheerful and hardworking. Brilliant, really. Though she can be a bit oblivious at times. I hear she caused an explosion in the kitchen last night...
Dimitri: Ingrid is Count Galatea's daughter. She is also a childhood friend of Felix, Sylvain and myself. She is diligent, industrious, and principled. In truth, she is more knightly than most knights you will ever meet.

Claude: Well, well. Scored a teaching gig here, did ya? Talk about a great first impression. I guess that means I'd better introduce myself properly. I'm Claude von Riegan. I'm from the ruling house of the Leicester Alliance, but don't worry too much about all that madness. I'm guessing you don't know which class you'll be teaching yet, do you? I bet you'd like ours. We're not as...difficult as the other two. Have you met the folks from the Golden Deer House yet? Care to know more about anyone?
Byleth: Yes. 
Claude: (laughs) Piqued your interest, have I? As luck would have it, I'm pretty curious about you as well. But what's life without a bit of mystery? Let's just spend the next year or so learning about each other, little by little.
Claude: He's the heir of Gloucester territory. If you haven't already picked up on it, he's a bit arrogant and fancies himself a lady's man. That said, deep down he's really devoted and honest... Though I wouldn't mind never hearing him talk about his noble obligations ever again.
Claude: He comes from a merchant family, but his parents died in an accident. Seems like he's had a rough life. Despite all that, he's just about the most cheerful guy you'll ever meet. His passions are training, eating, and... Actually, that's about it.
Claude: He's the second son of a merchant family. Since his brother will inherit the business, he's training to become a knight. If you ask me, doesn't seem like he truly wants to be a knight... He's probably just doing it to please his parents...
Claude: Lysithea is the daughter of Count Ordelia, and is probably the youngest student here. But watch out! She gets angry if you treat her like a child. As for me, I do it on purpose. You have to make your own fun in this place, you know?
Claude: Marianne is Margrave Edmund's daughter...and that's pretty much all I know about her. She doesn't interact much with other students, so I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of folks here have never even heard her speak.
Claude: Hilda is the only daughter of Duke Goneril. It seems her father and brother coddle her quite a bit. If you look up "lazy" in the dictionary...her picture won't be there because she never got around to submitting it. Not too unusual for a noble, I guess.
Claude: Leonie enrolled because she wants to be a mercenary. I think she said that her father is a hunter. She's pretty blunt and as stingy as they come. A habitual saver, too. I think she's hoping to repay her village for helping to send her here.

@Dialogue 
Byleth: (I suppose I should return to Rhea...)

@Conversation 
Student: This is the classroom of the Black Eagle House, which is for students from the Adrestian Empire. Our house leader is Princess Edelgard. There are many other nobles among our ranks as well.

Hubert: I am Hubert. A humble servant of Lady Edelgard. I heard you came to the aid of Her Highness. You have my most sincere thanks. This is Petra. She has come all the way from Brigid to study in the Empire. Back on her archipelago, she is actually a princess. In Fódlan terms, she would be called heir to the throne.
Petra: Hello. I am called Petra. I am pleased to be meeting with-- No, I am pleased to have met you.

Caspar: Is it true that you saved Edelgard? That's incredible! The name's Caspar, by the way. Pleased to meet ya!
Linhardt: Linhardt. Good-bye.
Caspar: Yeesh, Linhardt. How'd you get into the academy with those manners? So, are you a student here too? Maybe we'll be in the same class!

Bernadetta: Ah! What?! I don't talk to strangers!
Ferdinand: Bernadetta, this is no stranger! Our house leader owes this person a great debt. Is that not right? (To Byleth) I am Ferdinand von Aegir, legitimate son of the Aegir family, the Empire's foremost house. Are you going to join our class? I look forward to getting better acquainted with you.

Dorothea: Well, aren't you just lovely. Is this your first time in the monastery? Shall I show you around? Oh, my name is Dorothea. Before I joined the academy, I was a member of an opera company in the Empire. You should hear me sing sometime.

Student: This classroom belongs to the Blue Lion House. Our house leader is Prince Dimitri. All of us here hail from the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus.

Sylvain: Well, well! It must be my lucky day today, being approached by such a beauty. I'm Sylvain Jose Gautier. Feel free to say hi whenever you like.

Mercedes: And who's this? You don't look familiar at all. Do you work here at the monastery?
Annette: Oh, Mercie! Do you think this is that mercenary people have been talking about?
Mercedes: Now that I think about it, that does sound like something Dimitri may have said... I suppose you'll be enrolling at the Officers Academy too, then? Well, it's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Mercedes, and this is my best friend–
Annette: I'm Annette! It's nice to meet you.

Ingrid: I have heard all about what you did from Prince Dimitri. As a citizen of Faerghus, I thank you.
Felix: He also said you're quite skilled. And he doesn't just say things like that. I look forward to sparring with you and beating you.
Ingrid: Felix, must you always speak of fighting right away? Oh! And, uh...you may call me Ingrid. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

Ashe: Hi, there! You must be the one everyone's talking about. I'm Ashe. Great to meet you. This here is Dedue. He serves Prince Dimitri.
Dedue: I have heard that you rescued His Highness. Words cannot express my gratitude. Should you ever require my strength, please know that I will hasten to repay this debt.

Student: The Golden Deer House is for students of the Leicester Alliance. Our house leader is heir to the Alliance's leadership, House Riegan. We have plenty of other prominent nobles as well!

Raphael: Are you someone's guest? The dining hall's that way if that's what you're looking for.
Leonie: No, Raphael. That's Captain Jeralt's kid. Hi, I'm Leonie Pinelli–Captain Jeralt's first and greatest apprentice! I'm sure he's told you about me?
Raphael: Nice to meet you! I'm Raphael Kirsten. Who are you again?

Hilda: Hey, are you that mercenary? Everyone's been talking about you. I'm Hilda Valentine Goneril. And her name is...
Marianne: M-Marianne von Edmund...
Hilda: Are you joining the Knights of Seiros or something? Well, I look forward to seeing more of you!

Lysithea: So you're the skilled mercenary who saved Claude, are you?
Ignatz: Oh, you are? It's such an honor to meet you! Ignatz Victor. My parents are Alliance merchants.
Lysithea: And I am Lysithea von Ordelia. Please do not forget it.

Lorenz: Ah. You must be the renowned mercenary who rescued Claude. Honestly, you should not have troubled yourself over the likes of him. My name is Lorenz Hellman Gloucester. You will want to remember it.

Jeritza:  What do you want?  I am Jeritza. I teach here. Weapon instruction. These are the training grounds. Good-bye.

Gatekeeper:  Greetings! You must be the new professor. What a pleasure!  As for me, my job is to stand here at this glorious entrance and leisurely watch over the comings and goings of everyone. Make folks smile, you know?  Er...and by that, I mean...to vigilantly guard this entrance with my very life! No levity whatsoever. As of now, nothing to report.

Jeralt: Here I am again, the office of the captain of the knights. That said, I'm merely here to assist. Apparently the current captain is getting on in years. I hear the captain has a hard time keeping up with the responsibilities of the job.  That's where I come in.

Hanneman: This is my research laboratory. I've worked hard to furnish it with the rare materials and purpose-built equipment required for my work.

Manuela: Oh, Professor! Dropping by so soon? I expected we'd take some time. Exchange a few smiles as we passed in the hall, flirt a bit, you know... Well, you're here now, and I do like a man who knows what he wants. Lock the door. Huh. That welcome didn't faze you at all, did it? What's the matter? Don't you like me? Or...are you just so innocent you don't understand me?

Cyril: I'm real busy, so could you please move along now? Thanks. OK now, what else did Lady Rhea need doing today?

Tomas:  Welcome to the library. Here you may find literature from the far reaches of Fódlan.  I am Tomas, the librarian. If you have need of me, do not hesitate to ask. I have worked here for...hm. I have lost track of the decades, it seems.

@Dialogue 
Rhea: How are you enjoying your time at the academy thus far? I hope you have found our halls brimming with the vitality of well-intentioned souls.
Seteth: Hm. I suppose it is time for you to take charge of one of our three houses of students. I must note that I am personally against entrusting someone as lacking in trackable history as yourself with such a task, but it is as the archbishop desires.
Manuela: The Black Eagles, the Blue Lions, and the Golden Deer… All so different. I hope you’ve made it a point to get to know each of them.
Hanneman: Since you are new here, we have decided to allow you first pick. Manuela and I will take charge of the remaining two houses.
Byleth: (Which house will I choose...)
Rhea: Are you having trouble deciding? Please, open your heart to the will of the goddess and choose carefully.

^start 
Rhea: So, you have chosen the Black Eagles, led by Edelgard, correct?

Rhea: So, you have chosen the Blue Lions, led by Dimitri, correct?

Rhea: So, you have chosen the Golden Deer, led by Claude, correct?
^end

Rhea: Your heart has made its choice, then. All I ask is that you guide these open minds with virtue, care, and sincerity.
Seteth: They are all promising youths who bear the weight of Fódlan’s future upon their shoulders. I hope you appreciate what an honor it is to lead them.
Flayn: Brother? Oh! I am so sincerely sorry! I did not mean to interrupt.
Seteth: I am in the middle of something, Flayn. Is it urgent?
Flayn: No, no, it’s nothing. More importantly... Who is this?
Seteth: This is our newest professor at the academy.
Flayn: Oh my! A new addition to the Officers Academy! I am so very pleased to meet you, Professor. I am Seteth’s little sister, Flayn. I am so happy to make your acquaintance.
Seteth: Let us focus on the topic at hand. There is something you should be aware of. In a few days’ time, there will be a mock battle between the three houses, intended to gauge the current progress of the students. We will be using this battle as an opportunity to ascertain your own abilities as well. Please do not disappoint the archbishop. That is all.

@Dialogue 
^start
Caspar: Wait. So our new professor is...you?! I didn't see that one coming.
Dorothea: Easy, Caspar. Aren't you being a bit rude?
Linhardt: You know it's a waste of time to expect politeness from him.  It will be a pleasure learning from you, Professor. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to take a nap. 
Bernadetta: Ah! Don't look at me like that! Oh, and...please don't talk to me too much either.
Dorothea:  I'm sorry for the chaos you've walked into...
Ferdinand: I hear we are rather close in age, Professor. I hope you do not mind if we treat you like one of us. In our class, we try to treat each other as equals, despite any differences in age or status. Personally, I would love to include you in that inner circle.
 I don't mind at all.
Petra: You have a gut, Professor. I will take great joy from your teachings.
Dorothea: Petra, I believe you mean to say that our professor has guts. That's a bit different from having a gut. You can't go around saying someone so slim and attractive has a gut!
Petra: Oh! Please take my apologies. I have not yet mastered this language.
Edelgard: Professor, I want you to know that it's perfectly acceptable for you to treat me as you do the others. I may be the Imperial Princess, but here at the academy, I'm just another student. That said, know that I have high expectations of you. And high hopes. But I'm certain you can lead the Black Eagle House to greatness.
Caspar: Sure, sure. Now, let's break the ice with a training session! I want to see our new teacher in action.
Petra: Why will the ice be broken? Is this a custom I have missed in my studies?
Caspar: Not real ice, just the ice of...um--- Well, it just means let's get to know each other.
Bernadetta: I don't wanna train! Let's stay in the classroom and...learn from a book.
Dorothea: Let's all calm down and have a nice cup of tea, how about? Doesn't that sound lovely, Professor?
Linhardt: 
Ferdinand: I know we all agreed to treat each other as equals, but there is a limit to what I can tolerate. The esteemed Black Eagle House requires order.
Hubert:  Looks like your first job will be to quiet down this racket. I don't envy you.
Edelgard: Ugh, they're not normally this...rowdy. I do hope you can manage, Professor.

Annette: Wait, does this mean our new professor is-- No! I really can't believe it! But I was speaking to you so casually, as though we were companions! Oh, I am so sorry, Professor; you just look the same age as the rest of us, and-- Oh, and I’m sorry I just said that too! I really must watch my tongue…
Byleth: I don't mind if you treat me as a friend.
Annette: You say that, but...I just don't know about all of this.
Dimitri: I'll admit, it doesn't sit well with me either. After all, we wish to show you due respect.
Sylvain: Sure, but if the professor says it OK, shouldn’t that be enough? That is, if Your Highness can consent to such a thing. After all, we’re already speaking this way to our future king, so we may as well relax our speech with our professor too, right?
Dimitri: Well, we’re not in the Kingdom, so it only goes to follow that we should all speak companionably.  I concede. If the professor says it’s fine, we ought to accept that kindness gratefully.
Ingrid: As for me, I'm not sure I can manage.
Mercedes: You don’t have to force yourself if it’s too difficult. You’re fine with that too, right, Professor?
Sylvain: Such benevolence is a sight to behold! I don't suppose you would care to join me for tea? We could discuss education...and marriage.
Felix: Control yourself, Sylvain. I have more important matters to discuss with our new professor.
Felix: Having heard of your skills, I'm eager to meet you in battle. Come to the training ground later. There, you will show me what you’re capable of.
Dimitri: You aren't wasting any time, are you, Felix? As it were, count me in for any such battle.
Felix: Hmph.
Ashe: Pardon me, but I would also love to observe you in battle, for future reference. If that’s OK with you.
Dimitri: Ashe, I don’t have you speak of merely watching. You should join us as well.
Mercedes:  If you get injured, simply say the word, and I’ll patch you up straight away!
Dedue: Your Highness, do take care not to go overboard.
Dimitri: You worry too much, Dedue. I'll be fine, I promise.
Sylvain: My companions, is there not something inherently wrong with crossing blades, as a way to bond with each other?
Ingrid: Huh, I never thought of it that way. Well, if that’s how you feel, I suppose you’ll just stay behind while the rest of us are at the training ground?
Sylvain: Ingrid, my dearest friend! You really are too hard on me.
Dimitri: Well then, Professor, what do you think? As you can see, the Blue Lion House is a lively bunch, but you’ll fine none who work harder. I’m certain we’ll cause our fair share of trouble, but I’m very much looking forward to the year ahead.

Hilda: Wait, what?! Are you really our new homeroom professor?
Ignatz: Is that true? You aren't quite what I pictured. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
Hilda: I was sure you'd be roped into joining the knights!
Claude: Don't tell me, you chose this class just to get to know me better, right? I'm flattered, really.  Whoops. Now that you're our professor, maybe I should choose my words more carefully.
Byleth: I don't mind.
Claude: Oh? Well, then. Since we're pretty close in age and all, I suppose formalities aren't all that necessary.
Lorenz: One must truly marvel at the exceptionality of this appointment. Becoming a teacher to students almost the same age as yourself. How...unusual. I've heard you are a skilled mercenary, but I cannot shake my discomfort at your new position.
Raphael: Are you really as strong as they say? Let's see your biceps! I bet I've packed on more muscle than you!
Ignatz: I doubt that. Apparently our new professor was personally recommended by Alois, one of the knights.
Claude: As far as skill goes, I saw it with my own eyes. What's more, Teach here is the child of the most renowned former captain of the Knights of Seiros.
Leonie: I heard. There's no way a child of the captain isn't worthy. It's simply not possible.
Lysithea: "The Captain"? Who are you talking about?
Leonie: Captain Jeralt, of course, the most notable captain of the Knights of Seiros and a peerless mercenary.
Byleth: He's not that well known...
Byleth: You're exaggerating a bit.
Leonie: Hmph! It doesn't matter what you think of him. Captain Jeralt deserves nothing but respect.
Lysithea: Hm. Well, after working as a mercenary alongside a father figure such as he, I have high hopes for our professor.
Hilda: Just because someone is special... doesn't mean their children are special too, Lysithea. Assuming that a child is going to be exceptional just because of their lineage is a bad idea.  Don't you agree, Marianne?
Marianne: Huh? Oh, um, yes, I suppose so.
Leonie: Well, we can find out for ourselves in battle. I can't wait to see what tactics you've learned from the captain.
Raphael: A battle? Shouldn't we have a welcome party or something first? I'll get the meat.
Lorenz: How savage. I propose a nice conversation over tea instead. I am more than willing to procure some high-quality leaves.
Raphael: Tea? You can't get to know someone over tea. If there's no meat involved, it's not a party.
Lorenz: Your common sensibilities are grating to my noble ears. Please quiet yourself.
Claude: Sorry for the bickering, Teach. As you can see, the Golden Deer is a rowdy bunch. We're not especially unified. You'll find nobles and commoners alike here-- those who are dedicated to their studies alongside slackers. But hey, that just makes your life more exciting, right? I really hope you're looking forward to the year ahead as much as I am.

@Dialogue 
Hanneman: Say, while you're here...I'd like to use this device I designed to determine whether the power of a Crest resides within you. Won't hurt a bit. Promise. You don’t know about Crests? Well, allow me to tell you everything–absolutely everything–about them. Is your calendar clear? This will take a while. Crests are a fascinating topic, but before one can dive deeply into said topic, one must first understand what Crests are. They are power incarnate. They are said to have been bestowed upon humans by the goddess countless ages ago. They exist within the flesh, and are passed down through bloodlines. Those who carry crests may excel at magic, display exceptional strength, or any number of boons. Each Crest has its own power, the nature of which is beyond mortal understanding. For now.
Byleth: And you believe I have a Crest?
Hanneman: I suspect as much, yes. But we won’t know for sure unless I look into the matter. As I said, Crests are passed down through the blood. However, just because someone carries a Crest does not necessarily mean their descendants will inherit it as well. Only a scarce few descendants of a Crest’s bloodline end up inheriting that Crest’s power. Perhaps one of your ancestors bore a Crest, and you just happened to inherit it. That is how a Crest usually presents itself, after all.
Byleth: Do what you can to find out. 
Hanneman: Yes, of course. I'll get to the bottom of it straight away.
Byleth: There's no need to look into it.
Hanneman: I most strongly disagree! There absolutely is a need. My Crest research is of critical importance to the church, I'll have you know. Since you are now a professor here, I must insist that you aid in my research. Of course...there are those who lack the foresight to aid in my endeavors, such as that stubborn Seteth. But such individuals are the rare exception.
Hanneman: Now then, please go ahead and hold out your arm over this device here.

Hanneman: What is this?! A pattern I’ve never seen before…Is it possible an as-yet undiscovered Crest has been detected? To think there are still Crests out there that even I am unaware of! How thrilling! Ahem… Pardon my unrestrained jubilation. I have much to consider. You may leave now. I have more research to do in regard to this Crest. Yes, so very much more research. But for now, your work here is done.  Hmm… What could this line here be indicating? Perhaps it represents a lack of symmetry… or perhaps… What in the world? Oh, I see… It may be connected to that, but to a greater degree than usual…
Byleth: ...

Rhea: With each moon, professors of the Officers Academy receive a schedule for the month ahead. It notes the days on which events and missions will take place that month. Pay careful attention to your schedule so that you may thoughtfully plan what you intend to do each month, and when.

Byleth: (So, this is my room... I thought I heard a girl's voice...but I must have been imagining things.)

@Conversation 
Edelgard: Some believe the dignity of the Empire rests on the results of the mock battle. That's an overstatement, of course. Still, we must do our best to prevail. You should take the time to learn each student's abilities. Perhaps some extra lessons and training sessions are in order? You look as if you have no idea what's going on here. I know my way around, so I'm happy to help you find your footing.
Edelgard: The monastery has some exceptional facilities that everyone who lives at the Officers Academy is welcome to make use of. For example, you can enjoy a meal with your students at the dining hall or take part in some one-on-one sparring at the training grounds. I suggest visiting the various facilities whenever you have the time to spare. It's a great way to get to know the students, faculty, and various workers here.
Edelgard: Have you noticed the bulletin boards placed around the monastery? Those contain requests people have posted, as well as helpful information from the market. If you prove yourself by helping people with their requests, certain facilities here will become available for your use. The bulletin board is updated frequently, so I suggest checking it at least once a month.
Edelgard: You should take your time when speaking with everyone, but when it comes to using the facilities... Well, you need to be more careful with that. If you use them without planning ahead, your free time will be gone before you know it.
Edelgard: A great deal is expected from professors of the Officers Academy, so it's important to hone your skills. To put it plainly, you'll need to keep expanding your knowledge of all disciplines, not just battle.

Edelgard: I trust you're eager to face the Black Eagles in battle. Enjoy the thrill of anticipation while it lasts. Soon you'll wish you had chosen to lead our house instead.

Dimitri: I hear there will be a mock battle soon. We must not neglect our training. I trust that you will carefully study the strengths and weaknesses of each of your students, that you may provide effective guidance. Regardless of the results, this battle will be a great learning experience. Even so... What is the point of competition if the aim isn't to win? As this is your first time at the monastery, please allow me to show you the ropes.
Dimitri: Both students and teachers of the Officers Academy are free to use the facilities within the monastery. For example, you can dine with others at the dining hall or partake in one-on-one combat in the training grounds. I encourage you to wander around the monastery and lend an ear to the people living here.
Dimitri: There are bulletin boards in various places around the monastery. Have you seen them, Professor? There you can find requests from various sources, as well as information about the market. If you fulfill these requests, you should eventually be able to use even more of the facilities here. The bulletin board gets updated frequently. You would do well to check it once a month.
Dimitri: This probably goes without saying, but no matter which facility you use, it will take up a considerable amount of your time. It's helpful to plan out activities in advance so that you don't mistakenly squander your time here.
Dimitri: Professors at the Officers Academy are expected to have exceptional leadership skills. Students and teachers alike must devote themselves to their studies and strive to acquire great wisdom, even outside their respective Fields.

Dimitri: I heard about the upcoming mock battle. I want you to know, Professor, that I do not intend to lose. I hereby declare my intention to prevail at... Goodness, listen to me. The thrill of competition has carried me away. I won't speak so formally of a class assignment in the future.

Claude: Did you hear the news, Teach? Looks like we're gonna have a good ol' mock battle between the houses! The Golden Deer House isn't exactly what you'd call an elite group just yet, so you may want to whip everyone into shape with some extra training. After all, competition is only fun if you win. To that end, I'd better prepare as well. You know, I was researching what it's like to live here long before I even enrolled. Want me to fill you in, Teach?
Claude: Students and teachers of the Officers Academy are all free to use the facilities within the monastery. That means you can chow down with students in the dining hall, or get in some one-on-one sparring at the training grounds. As you explore the monastery, try visiting the various facilities and talking to the people who live here.
Claude: If you haven't noticed, there are bulletin boards in various places around here. You can check them out to see posted requests or to find more information about the market. I hear that fulfilling requests can even earn you the right to use more facilities. The bulletin board gets updated frequently, so it's probably a good idea to check it once a month.
Claude: Far be it from me to tell you how to use the facilities, but it's a good idea to be mindful of how you're using your time. If you don't think about how you're spending your free time, it'll be over before you know it.
Claude: Here at the Officers Academy, even professors are expected to study often to help maintain their strong leadership skills. In other words, students and teachers alike have to strive to grow in every possible field.

Claude: Hey, Teach! I hear there's gonna be a mock battle between the houses. I'm not gonna lie, I'm a bit concerned about facing an elite mercenary like you. Maybe take it easy on us, what do you say?

Hubert: Dimitri and Claude are the leaders of the other two houses. Do not underestimate them. When we take the field, it would be best not to engage the both of them at once.

Hubert: If you continue to insist on distracting me, I will have no choice but to get rid of you. Joking, of course. 

Ferdinand: Let me tell you the provenance of our class name. The eagle, that refers to the twin-headed eagle on the Adrestian Empire's coat of arms. And black is the traditional color of the Empire's armor, hence, "Black Eagles."

Linhardt:  The Great Tree Moon is the best time of the year for naps. I could just forget all about my assignment...
Byleth: That's not a good idea.
Byleth: Now I'm feeling sleepy too... 
Linhardt: Yeah... 

Caspar: Who, Jeritza sure seems strong. I kinda thought he was gonna be the new professor assigned to our class. After that teacher ran away during our outdoor training, I figured Jeritza was a natural replacement. I was surprised when you were suddenly appointed professor instead. I don't think I could hold my own against Jeritza in battle. I could probably take you though.
Byleth: Not a chance. 
Caspar: You really think so? With enough training, I'm sure I'll beat you someday!
Byleth: Probably.
Caspar: Hah! Seriously? You should really work on your self-confidence if you're planning on becoming a professor.

Bernadetta: Um. I, ah, was just heading back to my room–bye!
Byleth: ...
Bernadetta: I don't like to come out unless I really have to. Hope you're OK with that, Professor!

Dorothea: Hi, Professor. How're you doing? If you're not busy, would you like to join me on a little trip into town? If I'm cooped up in this dusty old monastery for too long, it drives me absolutely crazy.

Dorothea: Yes, it's true that I'm the only commoner in the Black Eagle House. I knew that before the first day of class. Those people are simply exhausting.

Petra: Professor. I hope you know I am having great abilities for reading and writing. With sadness, I still have struggles with speaking. If my ways of speak...of speech are causing a burden, I hope you will have forgiveness.

Petra: Here at the monastery, I have had many great learnings from many great people. I am hopeful to have learnings from you too. As forever, I will do my best trying!

Dedue: His Highness has said that he trusts you, and I have no cause for doubt. But if you mistreat him in any way, I will take action.

Dedue: Let me know when you are hungry. I will make you a quality meal, as thanks for your service to His Highness.

Felix: I'm busy. Do you want something?
Byleth: I was hoping to spar with you. 
Felix: I can't right now, but let's fight soon. I look forward to beating you.
Byleth: Nothing in particular.
Felix: Then get out of my way.

Ashe: Oh, did you come to look at the plants too? The greenhouse here is really incredible. There are so many rare flowers I'd never seen back home. And herbs I never even knew existed!
Byleth: I've never had much interest in plants.
Ashe: That's normal. They all looked the same to me before I really studied them.
Byleth: You seem well-informed on the subject. 
Ashe: My adoptive father is the real expert. He taught me everything I know about herbs, including how to tell them apart and how to make medicines.
Ashe: You should try looking around the greenhouse sometime, if the mood strikes you. Maybe something will catch your eye!

Sylvain: Hey, Professor. If you've got spare time, want to join me for a trip into town? We could try to pick up beautiful girls... Or not. I'm kidding! Don't look at me like that.

Sylvain: Well, there's Dorothea, Hilda, and Mercedes. Lady Rhea's quite the beauty too. And I must admit, I've even checked out Professor Manuela once or twice. You know, Professor, I think I'm going to like it at the Officer's Academy. There are beautiful girls as far as the eye can see...

Mercedes: Before I came to the Officers Academy, I attended a school of magic in the Kingdom capital. That's where I met Annie! That's what I call Annette. Oh, I guess Lorenz was at the school of magic too? But Annie was always just so nice to me, even though I was older. She's my best friend in the world.

Annette: Hello, Professor! Uh, I have a teeny tiny question for you, if that's all right... You haven't seen a man with hair the same color as mine, a scowling face, and a generally gloomy demeanour...have you?
Byleth: Looking for someone? 
Annette: Well, yes. It's a bit difficult to explain... Please just let me know if you do see him, OK?
Byleth: Can't say that I have.
Annette: I suppose it was silly to ask. Sorry for wasting your time!

Ingrid: The Blue Lion House derived its names from the honorary title of the first king of Faerghus. Loog, the King of Lions, wore brilliantly blue garments. His chivalric exploits are recorded in multiple legends. The library holds various historical accounts regarding him and the Blue Lions. If you find time, you should read them. They're filled with insights.

Lorenz: Our house is that of the Golden Deer. Do you know the significance of that name, Professor? Golden Deer are sacred creatures said to have protected Leicester since time immemorial. All three of the houses have a meaning behind their name. You should feel free to ask around, if that sort of knowledge interests you.

Raphael: Ugh. I really need to eat. I can't hold out until the next meal! Why can't the dining hall stay open all the time? I need to keep eating if I want to get stronger!

Ignatz: Have you memorized everyone's names yet? I'm Ignatz, in case you forgot. I'm looking forward to learning from you.

Ignatz: This is the Golden Deer House. You're in charge of a different house, right? Too bad we won't see more of each other. I'm happy to learn from you, if the opportunity comes up!

Lysithea: Hi, Professor. Have you gotten around to visiting the library yet? It's absolutely loaded with valuable information. I only wish I wasn't burdened with the necessity of sleep, so I could spend all my hours there.
Byleth: You like reading? 
Lysithea: In a manner, yes. But it's more that I want to learn as much as I possibly can.
Byleth: You ought to get some rest.
Lysithea: Please don't treat me like a child. I may be a bit younger than the others, but that really shouldn't factor in.

Marianne: Goddess, I pray to thee... Please protect us... ...

Hilda: So, about the mock battle that's coming up...you don't mind me sitting it out, do you? As a fragile maiden, I'm useless in battle. I'll just cheer everyone on instead!

Hilda: Oh, Professor! Have you adjusted to life at the academy yet? Me, I'm still not used to it. I'm not one for all this studying and training.

Leonie: I'm Captain Jeralt's first and best apprentice. I can beat anyone, Professor. Even you, if I have to! It may have been only for a short time, but I learned from the absolute best.

Rhea: Do bear in mind that even as you are appraising your students, they are appraising you as well. I hope that you will do your best to form lasting bonds with your flock. Oh, and I look forward to witnessing your prowess in the mock battle.

Seteth: These are the students' quarters. To better help you supervise them, you also have a room here. Your room is here at the end. Commoner students also reside on the first floor, while the second is primarily for students of noble birth. As a rule, we try to avoid discrimination based on social status here. But the nobility can be quite insistent when it comes to matters of propriety. Speaking of, it would be best for you to avoid improper conduct. I expect you to set a good example for the students.

Flayn: Hello there, Professor. Well, I call you that, but I am afraid that I am not a student here myself...
Byleth: That's a shame. 
Flayn: Should the opportunity arise, I would love to become a student and begin my studies in earnest.
Byleth: Where can I visit you, then?
Flayn: My brother would not be pleased if he heard you saying such things.
Flayn: The monastery is kind enough to provide a sanctuary for my brother and I. He's the only family I have.

Alois: Captain Jeralt has hardly changed since 20 years ago. I've aged at least three times as much as he has! Why am I talking about this? Oh, right, it was because I just overheard Tomas remarking on the subject. The leader of a legendary group of knights, returned. People are bound to be talking about the ol' captain!

Jeritza: I care nothing of friendship. If you have no business here, leave.

Jeralt: The church has changed a lot since my time. Seteth, Hanneman, Manuela, Jeritza, and many of the knights... None of them were around 20 years ago. Have you met Leonie yet? Apparently it was my influence that inspired her to leave her village. Sorry to burden you, but could you watch over her for me? She's the only apprentice I've ever had.

Hanneman: Apparently there is to be a mock battle between the houses. Interesting, but I hope you understand that I have far more important things on my mind. My research is proceeding slower than I would like. Your Crest is something of a challenge. Frustrating. Yet, also, quite intriguing. I was wondering if I might get a sample of your flesh. A couple square inches would do. No? Perhaps some blood? A couple of drops on the device are all I need.

Byleth: (It's some kind of experimental apparatus...)
Byleth: I might as well assist by providing a blood sample... 
Hanneman: Oh, thank you, Professor. Those few drops of blood are invaluable to my research! Oh, so much more to learn!
Byleth: I had better keep my distance.

Manuela: A mock battle? This early? Wow, Professor. They're not giving you any time to settle in, are they? Don't you worry though! Should you get injured, I will care for you all through your recuperation. I will see to you oh-so very, very, personally. 

Tomas: Professor, I hear you are lacking in knowledge of the Church of Seiros. The library contains countless documents about the teaching and history of the church. I encourage you to make good use of them.



Cyril: I'm a little busy.
Byleth: Oh, sorry.
Cyril: If you're looking for the greenhouse, it's right there. See it? Looks like a greenhouse? That's it.
Byleth: Can't we talk just a little? 
Cyril: I really can't right now, I got a lot of things to do. Work and stuff like that. Why don't you look at the flowers in the greenhouse instead? They're pretty.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! By the by, have you ever regretted a decision and wished you could go back and undo it? It's too bad there's no lesson for how to turn back the ol' clock, huh? But I suppose a bad decision isn't worth all that fuss anyhow!



Student: I'm not too keen on the professor of my class. I really hoped to focus more on strategy. Hmm, maybe I should talk to my professor about transferring to a different class.



Monk: There are two types of Crests. Major Crests manifest their power most effectively, while Minor Crests are slightly weaker. It is said that the closer a person's blood relation is to various saints and Heroes, the higher their chance of bearing a major Crest. Of course, there are also examples of Major Crests manifesting in children whose parents bear no Crest whatsoever. The exact nature of how and why Crests are inherited is still a mystery.



Priest: I hear a member of House Hresvelg, the ruling family of the Empire, has entered the Officers Academy for the first time in ages. It is said that the Adrestian Empire's very founding was aided by none other than Saint Seiros. That is why the Crest of Seiros is on the Imperial flag. In recent years, a rift has developed between the Empire and the church... Let us hope that this will be a good opportunity for both parties to reforge their close relationship of years past.



Knight of Seiros: As part of our commitment to the goddess, the knights undertake various missions across all of Fódlan. Assisting with the education of young nobles is also a part of our sacred duty.



Knight of Seiros: The Imperial princess, the crown prince, and the heir to the Alliance's leading house... This is one exceptional year, that's for sure. If you're a teacher here, you'd better watch your step. If anything were to happen to those kids... Well, suffice to say that it could harm the reputation of the Church of Seiros, which we've spent almost a millennium establishing.



Monk: Tomas has served as the monastery's librarian for decades. Actually, he was away from Garreg Mach for a spell, but he returned to his post last year. There is no one as familiar with the monastery archives as he is.

@Intro 
^start 
Edelgard: It's finally time for the mock battle. This is my chance to measure your worth as an instructor. Do you think you can rise to the challenge?
Byleth: "Leave it to me." 
Edelgard: So confident. This will be interesting.
Byleth: "I'm concerned..."
Edelgard: That doesn't inspire much confidence, does it?
Edelgard: Each of us has undergone strict training. We're prepared for anything that comes our way. That means there's no need to hold back. Show us what you're capable of.
Claude: Hey there! Did we miss our invite to this strategy meeting? Oh, no worries–we'll just join in now.
Edelgard: Simply tell me your weaknesses, and you're welcome to stay. But is there enough time to cover them all?
Claude: Ah, so you can't win unless you know my weakness? Poor princess. You really should believe in yourself more.
Edelgard: I spare no effort when pursuing victory. As a master of schemes, I should think you would understand.
Claude: Schemes? Me? I have no idea what you're talking about! I plan to fight fair and square, as ever.
Dimitri: Hearing the words "fair and square" from Claude can only be a bad omen.
Claude: Your Highnesses haven't known me for very long, but you already have me figured out, don't you?
Dimitri: No need to poke fun. I will fight with honor. That said, I will fight to win.
Edelgard: Yes, and the same is true of us. Right, Professor?
Byleth: "Don't go too hard on us."
Claude: No use trying to hide how you really feel, Teach. I can see it in your eyes–you don't intend to lose.
Byleth: "I don't intend to lose."
Dimitri: If that is how you feel, then I will not hold back.
Manuela: Aw, how precious. Looks like you and the students have become fast friends.
Hanneman: While I am pleased that you are taking the initiative to acquaint yourself with the students, I'm afraid it's about time for the faculty strategy meeting.
Claude: Ah, how time flies! In that case, I'll see you later.
Dimitri: Edelgard, Professor, be careful out there.

Dimitri: Ah, it's finally time for the mock battle. I'm eager to put my skills to use. And you, Professor?
Byleth: I'm looking forward to it. 
Dimitri: Excellent. I have high expectations for your command. That said, I've no doubt it will take everything we've got to pull a victory.
Byleth: I hope we can win.
Dimitri: I wouldn't worry too much about it. If you command use as you did back in the village, I have no doubt we'll be fine.
Dimitri: Our opponents are mighty, that much is certain, but I'm positive we can win.
Claude: Hey there! Did we miss our invite to this strategy meeting? Oh, no worries–we'll just join in now.
Dimitri: Nice try, Claude, but I do not intent to let slip our strategies. Especially when we are up against such strong opponents as you two.
Claude: Well now! Kind words from his kingliness. If that's the case, we'd better come up with some clever schemes so as not to disappoint. Right, Princess?
Edelgard: Right. No matter the tactics you devise, we will destroy you. The best you can hope for is to learn a thing or two.
Dimitri: Haha, there's nothing wrong with a friendly rivalry, but let's not get carried away. A rash attitude could be your undoing, after all.
Edelgard: Hmm... Perhaps your time would be better spent preparing instead of worrying about the competition's mindset.
Claude: Hey, now! If you two are getting this fired up before the battle even starts...it'll make it that much easier for my class to sweep up a win. So please, carry on.
Dimitri: A good point, Claude. I apologize–that wasn't my intention. At any rate, let's vow to make this a productive battle, shall we?
Byleth: Don't go too hard on us.
Claude: No use trying to hide how you really feel, Teach. I can see it in your eyes–you don't intend to lose.
Byleth: I don't intend to lose.
Edelgard: Oh? In that case, I won't hold back.
Manuela: Aw, how precious. Looks like you and the students have become fast friends.
Hanneman: While I am pleased that you are taking the initiative to acquaint yourself with the students, I'm afraid it's about time for the faculty strategy meeting.
Claude: Ah, how time flies! In that case, I'll see you later.
Edelgard: I look forward to assessing your abilities. I hope you don't disappoint.

Claude: Time for a mock battle, eh? Hmm, how should we go about this... Well, you'll be our commander, that much is for sure. Just don't screw it up and everything'll be great. Got it, Teach?
Byleth: I'm not concerned.
Byleth: Leave it to me.
Claude: Right. I'll do whatever I can to help too. I mean, I'm kind of obligated to. For example! If I add a little something to their food to upset their stomachs...
Byleth: Don't even think about it.
Claude: Yeah, yeah, wink, wink. I read you. You can't officially condone that sort of thing, right? But say, hypothetically speaking, students from the other houses started racing to the infirmary... As far as anyone knows, it could just be a harmless little stomach bug making the rounds.
Edelgard: Well, well. What a fascinating conversation you two are having. May we join?
Dimitri: Claude, I can't believe you would stoop to such crooked schemes to gain the advantage. Have you no honor?
Claude: If that was really my scheme, I wouldn't be talking about it out in the open. I'm afraid you'll have to wait until our battle to see what's really in store.
Edelgard: It's irrelevant anyhow. Whatever you have planned won't save you from a crushing defeat.
Dimitri: She has a point. Still, I'm rather eager to see what sort of scheme that mind of yours conjures up.
Claude: You heard 'em, Teach. We can't let these fine folks down.
Byleth: It will be a fair fight.
Claude: Heh, of course. A fair fight, as all fights are. Good one, Teach. Play innocent now so they won't see it coming.
Byleth: If they insist. 
Claude: Are you serious, Teach? Well, if a crooked scheme is really what you're after, I've got more than a few of those up my sleeve.
Manuela: Aw, how precious. Looks like you and the students have become fast friends.
Hanneman: While I am pleased that you are taking the initiative to acquaint yourself with the students, I'm afraid it's about time for the faculty strategy meeting.
Dimitri: I'm sorry, Professors. It's about time I returned to my training anyhow. Claude, Edelgard, until we meet again on the battlefield, farewell.
Edelgard: I look forward to assessing your abilities. I hope you don't disappoint.

@Opening 
Formerly a promising young mercenary, you are now the newest professor at the prestigious Officers Academy. Students and faculty alike look on with curiosity as you engage in a mock battle between the school's three houses.

@Battle 
Edelgard: The mock battle is finally here. Will you lead us to victory?

Jeralt: I'm sure you already understand, but the house that defeats the other two is declared the winner. Incidentally, I'll be overseeing this mock battle. So listen well if you want to win.

Lorenz: None of your shallow tactics are required, Claude. Ignatz and I will dismantle the opposition.
Ignatz: Me?! But I'm not ready!
Claude: Are you making light of our new professor? If you drop your guard, you're going to get hurt...
Dimitri: Ashe, can you move to the front lines? I want to lure the enemy this way.
Ashe: Got it, Your Highness! Leave it to me!
Dimitri: Once you've finished preparing, make your move. Dedue, Mercedes. Keep our enemy occupied until then.
Dedue: I'm on it.
Mercedes: Oh my! We'll try our best!

Claude: Well done, Teach! I may have to take this seriously after all!

Claude: Let's use the forest to set up an ambush. I'm counting on your support, everyone!
Jeralt: If they're waiting in the forest, we'd do well to take a detour.

Claude: Welp, we're surrounded. All we can do is fight back with all our might!

Claude: Are you really gonna fight two houses at once? Heh, an impressive display of confidence.
Dimitri: This is a good opportunity for us. Let's forge ahead!

Dimitri: Beautiful work, Professor. But the true challenge starts now!

@Boss 
%Byleth,Dimitri
Dimitri: You're a tough opponent, but I refuse to yield. Do not fool yourself into believing I will hold back!

%Edelgard,Dimitri
Edelgard: Dimitri... It's time! We can finally settle the question of who's stronger.
Dimitri: Very well. I accept your challenge. With you as my opponent, I won't hold anything back.
Edelgard: I would expect no less!

%Byleth,Claude
Claude: Coming up with brilliant schemes, I can handle. No problem. But I'm not much for fighting. Go easy on me!
Byleth: ...
Claude: You know that was a joke, right? Jeez, not so much as a smile...

%Edelgard,Claude
Claude: Look at that, a real life princess! I'll have to be careful not to scar that little face of yours.
Edelgard: Careful, Claude. I'll win no matter what, but you're only making things harder for yourself.
Claude: Losing hasn't even crossed your mind, has it? Ooh, this'll be a bit of a shock, then.
Edelgard: To shock was your intention to begin with, was it not?

@Character-Falls 
Lorenz: I've lost?! Oh! Unthinkable!

Ignatz: I've lost. The new professor is quite a commander.

Hilda: Ouch! Was that really necessary?

Claude: Argh, I hate losing! I guess I'll just have to settle for cheering the others on.

Claude: I must have let my guard down. I guess that's a loss for the Golden Deer House.

Manuela: Well done. I nearly wound up a patient in my own infirmary.

Ashe: Ah–so strong! Have to do better next time...

Dedue: Ngh. Apologies, Your Highness. I can go no further.

Mercedes: Oh no... This is as far as I can go...

Dimitri: My training was insufficient... I am so sorry, everyone. The rest is up to you.

Dimitri: I suppose that does it for the Blue Lion House...

Hanneman: My goodness. The leadership of someone with actual battle experience is... Well! I was as good as useless.

Ferdinand: I am the son of House Aegir! How did I fail? I must need to train harder...

Hubert: Hmm. The new professor's rather strong. Suppose I'll have to call it a day.

Dorothea: My, my... The new professor seems very capable.

Edelgard: Forced to retreat... Well, things will only get tougher from here on out.

Edelgard: To think that the Black Eagles could lose so readily...

@End 
Jeralt: All right, that's that! The winner of this mock battle is... The Black Eagle House!

Edelgard: Even though it was just a mock battle, we defeated both houses masterfully. Take pride in this victory, everyone!

Dimitri: This victory is the result of everyone's hard work. Thank you, my friends. You did well.

@Battle 
Dimitri: It is about time for the battle to begin. Our victory depends on your leadership. Do not let us down.

Lorenz: None of your shallow tactics are required, Claude. Ignatz and I will dismantle the opposition.
Ignatz: Me?! But I'm not ready!
Claude: Are you making light of our new professor? If you drop your guard, you're going to get hurt...
Edelgard: Dorothea, will you head towards the front lines? I wish to draw the enemy towards us.
Dorothea: You got it, Edie. Leave it to me.
Edelgard: Ferdinand. Hubert. If the enemy comes, stop them.
Ferdinand: Leave it to us, although I could do this on my own.
Hubert: Heh. Clearly not, or Her Highness would not ask me to watch your back.

Claude: Well done, Teach! I may have to take this seriously after all!

Claude: Let's use the forest to set up an ambush. I'm counting on your support, everyone!
Jeralt: If they're waiting in the forest, we'd do well to take a detour.

Claude: Welp, we're surrounded. All we can do is fight back with all our might!


Claude: Are you really gonna fight two houses at once? Heh, an impressive display of confidence.
Edelgard: Victory is in sight, Black Eagles. Do not let up!

Edelgard: Flawless tactics, Professor. Our only choice in this situation is a head-on attack!

@Boss 
%Dimitri,Claude
Claude: Psst, Your Princliness. You've got a thing for Edelgard, right? Come on, fess up. You'll feel better.
Dimitri: Claude, please. This is no time for idle banter. Your defenses are wide open.
Claude: That didn't get to him, huh? What a shame. I'll find a better way to ruffle him up next time.

%Byleth,Edelgard 
Edelgard: There can be no victory unless I defeat you. So be it!

@Battle 
Claude: So this is the stage for the mock battle... The command's all yours, Teach!

Ferdinand: I will fight on the front lines! I can stop the enemy's advance with grace!
Hubert: Do you have Lady Edelgard's permission to--hmph. I suppose I've no choice but to provide cover.
Edelgard: Thank you Hubert. We are off to a terrible start.
Dimitri: Ashe, can you move to the front lines? I want to lure the enemy this way.
Ashe: Got it, Your Highness! Leave it to me!
Dimitri: Once you've finished preparing, make your move. Dedue, Mercedes. Keep our enemy occupied until then.
Dedue: I'm on it.
Mercedes: Oh my! We'll try our best!

Edelgard: Hm, you are performing as expected, Professor. We will have to face you with our full might!

Edelgard: We will use the forest to ambush our enemy. Everyone, I am counting on your support!
Jeralt: If they're waiting in the forest, we'd do well to take a detour.

Edelgard: It seems we're surrounded... At a time like this, our only option is to cut a path through!

Edelgard: Are you planning on fighting two houses at once? I will admit, that is favorable for us.
Dimitri: This is a good opportunity for us. Let's forge ahead!

Dimitri: Beautiful work, Professor. But the true challenge starts now!

@End 
Claude: Great work, everyone! Even if it's just a mock battle, the taste of victory is sugary sweet!

^start 
Edelgard: Excellent work today, Professor. Though our victory should come as no surprise.
Byleth: It was a close call.
Edelgard: Was it? I'm not sure I agree with that.
Byleth: It was easy.
Edelgard: Yes, it was. Further proof that you're well qualified to guide the Black Eagles.
Petra: That was impressing, Professor! I mean...impressive. We gained a victory because of your great leadership.
Dorothea: We certainly did. We all tried our best, of course, but we couldn't have won without you.
Ferdinand: I was curious what it would look like if you did not hold back. And you did not disappoint!
Hubert: Hmph. I daresay we owe our victory to Lady Edelgard.
Linhardt: How so? For that battle, she was only a soldier following our professor's command. Sure, she was an incredibly powerful soldier...
Caspar: Don't worry about it too much, Linhardt. All that matters is that we won!
Bernadetta: I'm all done with being on the battlefield, OK? I'd rather stay back than pursue victory out there.
Edelgard: You are all as ridiculous as always. We only managed to win because we worked together.
Edelgard: Was it something I said? Is it so odd, me talking about togetherness? If so, that perception must change. In fact, I'm canceling the festivities so we can discuss this topic further. I'm kidding, of course. Come on, everyone! We've earned this celebration.

Dimitri: Professor! I've been looking for you.
Dimitri: I was hoping we could all share a meal together. It could serve as both a victory celebration and a post-battle analysis. What do you think?
Byleth: A victory celebration?
Dimitri: Of course. After all, we fought hard out there. Such exertion is bound to make anyone hungry for respite, don't you agree?
Byleth: I'm invited?
Dimitri: Of course. Why wouldn't you be?
Sylvain: Come now, Professor! We can't very well celebrate without the key to our victory present.
Annette: He's right! He really is! We were only able to win because we had your help, Professor!
Felix: Yes. Compared with that boar who knows nothing save frontal attacks, your tactics were nearly decent.
Ingrid: Felix! You really ought to stop picking fights with His Highness.
Dimitri: Don't worry, Ingrid. I encourage all to speak freely. And I must agree that the professor's tactics were truly extraordinary. I have much to learn.
Mercedes: Oh, sure, but today was exhausting, I'm so hungry I can barely stand...
Ashe: To be honest, so am I. Let's head to the dining hall. Together.
Byleth: ...
Dimitri: Professor. I'm sorry to intrude, but...you don't look too happy for someone who just won.
Byleth: You're mistaken.
Dimitri: You say that, but your eyes tell a different story.
Byleth: Is that so...
Dimitri: Hm. Well, I understand how difficult it can be to accept joy sometimes. I'm sorry for prying.
Dimitri: I know we only just met, so this may be difficult for you, but... I'd love nothing more than to share our happiness with you. Joy can be so fleeting, after all. We're all in this together...so I hope you will consent. I'm sure the rest of the class feels the very same. Well...come along, Professor. Let's enjoy the fruits of our labor!

Claude: Great work, Teach! That was a brilliant win.
Byleth: I'm glad we won.
Claude: I've been anticipating that magic moment when your tactics and my schemes entwined, and you did not disappoint. That composed expression you always sport like a permanent mask is a perfect complement to my ruthless scheme. That's a joke, of course. Mostly.
Byleth: Everyone did well.
Claude: Huh. Playing ignorant as to the quality of you command and deflecting the praise to your students. You really are a model professor, Teach.
Claude: To be honest, I had a bunch of other schemes planned as well, just in case the situation called for it. But I didn't have to resort to any of them. I suppose our opponents lucked out.
Lorenz: Well met, Professor! The breadth of your skill was on full display today. I must admit that your tactics were masterful. I shudder to think what may have transpired had it been Claude leading us into battle.
Raphael: I noticed that too! We just did what you told us, and we won! I love it!
Lysithea: As expected from a child of the former captain of the knights. Thank you for today, Professor. I have much to consider.
Hilda: I never doubted that our professor would be amazing! It was way too obvious. Don't you agree, Marianne?
Marianne: Huh? Me? Oh, um, yes. Of course. Well done, Professor.
Leonie: Captain Jeralt taught his child well. It would have been more of a surprise had our professor proved lacking.
Ignatz: Don't you think it's a bit hard to give Jeralt all of the credit, Leonie? In any case, it's clear that we only won because of our new mentor's guidance.
Claude: A mercenary's wisdom and techniques are forged in battle. Those are the sorts of things you can only learn through experience. Right, Teach? But more importantly, it's time to celebration our victory! Teach here has yet to try my well renowned home cooking.
Claude: I really do hope you'll join us. After all, I swiped some finely aged cheese from the dining hall for just this occasion.

@Dialogue 
Rhea: Your work with the students was remarkable. I can see Jeralt trained you well. I do hope you were able to use the occasion to bond with the students.
Byleth: I did.
Rhea: I am so happy to hear it. Nothing would please me more than if you would use this coming year to grow closer still.
Byleth: Not really.
Rhea: Oh? Well, you have only just met them, so I suppose that should come as no surprise.
Seteth: Of course, the mock battle was mere practice. The real fight is the Battle of the Eagle and Lion, which will take place during the Wyvern Moon. You are expected to properly train your students so as not to humiliate the academy during the long-held tradition that is the coming battle.

Rhea: As for today, I have called you here to tell you of your mission for the month ahead. Your class is to dispose of some bandits causing trouble nearby.
Byleth: My mission?
Byleth: Bandits?
Seteth: Those affiliated with Garreg Mach Monastery have a moral obligation to help those in need, regardless of social standing. Students are no exception. Each month, before the newly birthed moon departs, each house of students must complete their assigned mission. You shall work to complete the task at hand alongside your students and report back to the archbishop before the deadline. Understood? I will soon provide you with the necessary details for your first mission. If I told you now, I expect you would only forget, and I despise repeating myself.
Rhea: I can sense something special within your heart... I have high hopes for you.

Sothis: Bandits, they say…
Byleth: ?!
Sothis: Do you recall when we first met? You shall not fall so shamelessly again, correct?
Byleth: ...
Sothis: Have you no words for me? Do not tell me that you are shocked to hear from me! You ought to know that I am always with you now. To hear my voice should not come as a shock.
Byleth: Right.
Byleth: I don't understand.
Sothis: Whatever shall I do with you? I am alive within the confines of your heart. I am unknown to all but you. But through your eyes and ears, I see and hear. Just listen to your heart, as you are doing now, and we may speak like this. That is all that I know.
Byleth: ...

Kostas: What is this nonsense?! All I was told was to kill as many noble pipsqueaks as possible! No one said anything about the Knights of damned Seiros being on our trail!

Flame Emperor: You have proven yourself worthless. Distracted by something so trivial. I had hoped you would achieve your goal despite the setback. But now a child of the Knights’ former captain is in play. How interesting.
Kostas: Hey, this isn't what I agreed to!
Flame Emperor: Hiring a mercenary as a professor. What was that woman thinking?
Kostas: Are you listening to me?! How do we finish this?!
Flame Emperor: You die.
Kostas: Wh– What?
Flame Emperor: Underestimating the Knights was an amateur mistake. One you will pay for. The road to eternal torment awaits you all. Now I must locate your replacements...

Kostas: Wait! Get back here! Damn you!
