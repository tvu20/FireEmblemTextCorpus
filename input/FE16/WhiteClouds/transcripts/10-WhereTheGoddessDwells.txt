@Opening 
Long ago, the guardian Seiros made an appearance during this moon. She had been summoned by the goddess, whose soul was suffering as the flames of war raged across Fódlan. Some believe that high in the sky above Seiros, the Immaculate One's mighty wings are what powered the strong winds carrying the guardian and her forces into battle.

@Dialogue 
Edelgard: You're here again... Professor... You've been crying. So even you cry sometimes. Oh... I suppose that was thoughtless of me to say.
Byleth: Yes, it was.
Edelgard: Long ago, someone said the same to me.
Byleth: It's fine. 
Edelgard: My teacher. You're so blinded by grief that you can't see what's going on right in front of you.
Edelgard: Are you waiting for time to heal your wounds? Or have you curled up in a corner and lost the will to carry on?
Byleth: Does it matter?
Edelgard: It does. You've lost yourself.
Byleth: How could you ask me something like that?
Edelgard: It's not like you to speak to me like that. You know I'd never ask you a question without purpose.
Edelgard: Only you can truly understand your own sadness. Others can sympathize or even empathize, but all anyone else can offer are the tears of an outsider looking in. So I have no intention of crying for you, or of standing still with you. All I can do is promise to reach out my hand when the time comes for me to move forward.
Byleth: What do you mean?
Edelgard: The mysterious organization that was carrying out experiments in Remire Village and the chapel... They're up to something near Garreg Mach. The archbishop has sent the knights to undertake a large-scale investigation. No information has surfaced yet, but our enemies will soon be discovered. When they are, will you lead us into battle? Or will you just sit here with no thought for the future that is fast approaching? My teacher... There is a choice to be made. I hope you make the right one.

Sothis: My, my. She really is quite arrogant. She spoke her mind without an ounce of reservation! But she is right. The time has come to stand again. You already know what your answer is.

Monica: Oh, thank you. You saved me!
Thales: If you were to die, then the mystery of our bodies would be revealed. Preventing that was my only aim. I'm afraid you must remain, Kronya. There is something I need you to do.
Monica: Oh, of course. I am always happy to cooperate with Solon. Leave it to me.
Flame Emperor: How annoying.
Thales: Flame Emperor... Is she offending you? Unfortunately, we cannot take our eyes off her, so there is nothing to be done. You are our greatest creation. We used the defiled beast's blood as the fuel to your flame, that you may burn even the gods. Now is the time to cleanse Fódlan of that power, and bring forth our salvation.
Flame Emperor: There will be no salvation for you and your kind. Those responsible for such gruesome deeds in Duscur and Enbarr.
Thales: All so that you may acquire the strength you need. All for a purpose...

Sothis: What are you going at this hour? Ooh, I know... You are eavesdropping! I must admit that I approve.

Dimitri: Professor? We must remain quiet...
Sothis: I see... The Flame Emperor and Monica...and the mage who rescued Monica.
Byleth: It's time for revenge. 
Dimitri: Not yet, Professor.
Byleth: What is that guy's name?
Dimitri: I don't know, but if we keep listening, we might be able to find out.
Sothis: An unexpected change to hear their plans! Patience, patience!

Monica: Oh, thank you. You saved me!
Thales: If you were to die, then the mystery of our bodies would be revealed. Preventing that was my only aim. I'm afraid you must remain, Kronya. There is something I need you to do.
Monica: Oh, of course. I am always happy to cooperate with Solon. Leave it to me.
Flame Emperor: How annoying.
Thales: Flame Emperor... Is she offending you? Unfortunately, we cannot take our eyes off her, so there is nothing to be done. You are our greatest creation. We used the defiled beast's blood as the fuel to your flame, that you may burn even the gods. Now is the time to cleanse Fódlan of that power, and bring forth our salvation.
Flame Emperor: There will be no salvation for you and your kind. Those responsible for such gruesome deeds in Duscur and Enbarr.
Thales: All so that you may acquire the strength you need. All for a purpose...
Dimitri: I've got you... Finally...
Byleth: Wait.
Byleth: Don't go out there.
Byleth: Let's keep listening.
Dimitri: If we don't act now, we'll miss our chance!
Flame Emperor:  Hmm...
Thales: Hmph. Even if someone has overhead us, there is nothing they can do. There have always been rats in the walls, and there always will be.
Flame Emperor: ...

Dimitri: No... The dagger...
Byleth: What's wrong?
Byleth: What about the dagger?
Dimitri: It...no. Never mind. It couldn't possibly be so. Professor, those are the ones we must destroy. They're the bastards who killed my family and Jeralt. For now, let's return to the monastery and regroup. As for the Flame Emperor's dagger...I'll hold on to it for the time being.

Sothis: Day 5 of the Garland Moon. I picked some flowers for her and returned home. The look of joy on her face at the sight of these flowers will be even more beautiful than the flowers themselves… Yeesh! That is enough. His entries from before your birth are full of such romantic blatherings as that. Oh… It must be deeply moving you to hear such things, but now is not the time for whimsy. Someone is here. You do not wish for them to see you in this state. So pull yourself together!

Claude: I thought I might find you here, Teach. Not the type to wallow in solitude, eh? That's a relief, let me tell you. So… What were you reading? Is that Jeralt's…
Byleth: Diary.
Claude: So it is.
Byleth: Love letter.
Claude: The contents are certainly bittersweet… But I think it's Jeralt's diary.
Claude: Hey, maybe this has some entries from when Jeralt left the monastery.
Claude: Is that so… He was the captain of the knights, but something made him leave the monastery in a hurry. If it has something to do with your birth, knowing what happened may get us closer to knowing what secrets the church is hiding… Teach… Would you mind letting me read that diary? I know how important it is to you, but I'm not asking lightly. Please, allow me to borrow it.
Byleth: You may borrow it.
Claude: I'm forever in your debt, Teach. If you'd refused, I would've had to sneak in here in the dead of night. I wasn't looking forward to that prospect. Anyway, let me fill you in on what's been going on lately, and not just as thanks for pointing me to that diary.
Byleth: I can't allow it.
Claude: Wait, are you really saying I'm going to have to sneak in here in the dead of night to read it? I know how important it is to you, but I'm not asking lightly. Please, allow me to borrow it. 
Claude: Rhea dispatched the knights to various locations in a frantic search for the enemy. There's a rumor that she's already secured some information. Something big is gonna happen soon. That has me wondering… If you find out where the enemy is, what will you do about it? If you ask, I… No, scratch that. All of us students would gladly lend a hand. Even if it means going against Rhea's wishes. Don't forget it. Now go. Everyone's worried about you. You'd better show them you're in good spirits.

@Conversation 
Sothis: If you must weep, then weep. I shall be here for you.
Byleth: Thank you.
Sothis: Well, it would be ridiculous not to feel anything after something like that. Go on and let it out. I am here. 
Byleth: That won't be necessary.
Sothis: Are you already past it? You are unflappable. I will give you that much. In that case, I will remain silently supportive. You are right that we must keep moving ever onward.

Edelgard: Professor, I'm so happy to see you. You're finally returning to your old self. To see the light in your eyes again is a gift. It inspires me to carry on as well. As you know, the knights are searching furiously for any trace of the enemies who escaped. I'll inform you immediately if I learn anything relevant.



Edelgard: What happened to Jeralt... It's terrible. If there's anything I can do, simply ask. Even if what you desire is revenge...I'll gladly lend you my power. We can't let them get away with this.




Dimitri: Professor! Welcome back... I was... We all were...  You've been on our minds. Know that your enemies are my enemies. I will do all I can to help you find justice. There is no one else I can... My strength is yours alone. I will fight as you command... I will kill anyone should you ask it of me.



Dimitri: I'm so sorry about what happened to Jeralt... No...of course my sorrow is nothing compared to yours. The knights are even now searching for our enemies' whereabouts. They are to report back the moment they find something. If you desire revenge, Professor...you can count me in.




Claude: Hi, Teach. I see the storm in your eyes has passed… You're looking much better. I've been reading Jeralt's diary. The baby he mentions… That's you, isn't it? I can't understand about half of what's written on here… But Jeralt really cherished you. That much is clear.



Claude: I haven't lost a parent yet, so I can't even begin to understand how you must be feeling... But even while you're standing still, the world keeps on moving. I always find that oddly comforting.




Hubert: I've never been much for condolences. How about a little logic, instead? The knights have spread out around Garreg Mach in search of Jeralt's murderers. Thus, the monastery's fighting strength is, for the moment at least, depleted. Perhaps that was the enemy's real objective. We should be prepared for further confrontation.

Hubert: I've never been much for condolences.

Petra: Professor, please lend us your ears. Ferdinand is saying impossible things.
Ferdinand: I do not see what is impossible about it. All I said was that if you want to go back to Brigid, you probably can. You are...the Empire's guest, so to speak. They cannot afford for something bad to happen to you. There would be a diplomatic incident. Someone close to us has turned up dead, so one could argue that you're not safe here anymore.
Petra: You were already told! I am learning here, from the academy. What are you thinking, Professor?
Byleth: You do not have to leave if you do not wish it. 
Byleth: You may return home if you please. 
Petra: I am not returning to home until I have grabbed my goal! I will not be listening to the words of Ferdinand.
Ferdinand: No, look, I did not mean to pressure you. Apologies for the misunderstanding.



Linhardt: I slipped quietly into the vault and rummaged about, looking for anything we might find useful. There is a group of people who want to kill us, after all. What? This is no time for asking permission. I learned long ago that one can ask permission or forgiveness. It is rarely useful to request the former. Still, it appears that the knights have already taken everything useful. There were Crest-related objects I thought might be worth studying, so– There you go again with that stern look. Of course I'll put them back when I'm done. Assuming they bear no additional use.



Caspar: I'm not even close to being strong enough. I mean, Jeralt was so much stronger than me, but even he... That's enough. I can't dwell on the past. There's no way to know what my future holds but I do know one thing. Whatever happens, I have to make my own way in this world. I have to keep pushing so I can grow even stronger!



Bernadetta: Professor? I, um, I brought some flowers for Jeralt.
Byleth: Thank you. 
Bernadetta: It's the least I can do. Sometimes I feel like all I do is run away...
Byleth: You're out of your room...
Bernadetta: Hey! Sometimes I go out for, uh...walks...
Bernadetta: Anyway, I'll go lay them out.



Dorothea: I've sung lyrics lamenting death many times on stage... But when something like this happens in real life... I'm lost. I don't know what to say. But I do know this much... Sir Jeralt must have been very proud to have you as his child.



Dedue: It is a shame what happened to Jeralt. I am sorry. There are no words. Leave some flowers on his grave for me.

Sylvain: Dark expressions don't suit you, Professor. But I'm... Well, I'm glad to see you out in the world again. It seems this month will be a quiet one around here. There aren't many knights around to liven things up.
Felix: Most of the knights are gone, seeking out the enemy.
Sylvain: Isn't that a bit much? I agree it's important, but is it a good idea to neglect the safety of the monastery?
Felix: What do you think, Professor?
Byleth: It would be a shame if we were invaded. 
Felix: I agree. We can send some knights after our enemies, but so many? It makes the church seem reckless.
Byleth: You're worrying too much.
Sylvain: Hopefully the knights finish their business and hurry back. I wouldn't mind having a few extra lances around.



Ashe: Not just Tomas, but Monica too. We can't be sure who to trust anymore, can we? Who are these people, really? What do they want?

Mercedes: I'm so glad you're OK, Professor. I was so worried!
Annette: Oh, Professor! You must be starving. Mercie and I made some sweets for you. We were thinking that if you were to eat something sweet, it might help you feel better.
Byleth: Thank you for the thought. 
Mercedes: Baking sweets is my specialty. I'm sure they'll do the trick.
Byleth: I'm fine. 
Annette: Well, of course you are! And if you have sweets you'll be even more fine.



Ingrid: I'm so sorry... I never quite know what to say at times like these... Just...don't push yourself too hard too soon. It's OK to allow yourself to be sad right now. Losing someone dear to you... Well, each loss is unique, but it's a feeling I know very well. That said... Professor, I...



Lorenz: There is no one here who has not heard tales of Jeralt's valor. We have suffered a most dear loss. I do not know what the enemy's aim was, but I do know this–after what they have done, we cannot suffer them to live. If there is anything I can do to ensure that justice is brought swiftly, you need only give the word.



Raphael: You've gotta keep yourself active during tough times, Professor. Even if it seems impossible. That's how I got through when I lost my parents. If you need help with anything, just come and see me. Eating and training are my specialties.



Ignatz: I'm scared. I feel that I don't understand the world. How could something like that happen to Jeralt? He was so strong.
Byleth: Even though you're scared, push through. 
Ignatz: You're inspiring, Professor. Ill do my best.
Byleth: What happens, happens.
Ignatz: I suppose, but... Please, take care, Professor! We can't afford to lose you too.



Lysithea: I'm sure you will pull through this because you're so strong, Professor. Best to stay calm during such tumultuous and upsetting times. We don't know the nature of our enemies. If we underestimate them, anything could happen.
Byleth: But if we don't defeat them…
Lysithea: I agree they must be defeated, but I also feel we must approach this with prudence.
Byleth: We should be careful. 
Lysithea: Yes, I agree. I…don't want to lose you too, Professor.

Hilda: Professor! People are saying horrible things about Marianne. They're saying she's friends with the bad guys. If I hear someone say that, I'll…
Marianne: Leave it alone, Hilda. It doesn't matter.
Byleth: Just ignore it. 
Marianne: Of course. Thank you, Professor.
Byleth: We'll defeat the bad guys. We'll show them. 
Hilda: That would be the quickest way to resolve this. Come on Marianne, let's give it our all.




Marianne: I'll say a prayer for Jeralt's soul. There's not much else I can do…




Hilda: Professor, it seems like you're holding up OK, but… I'm worried about Leonie. She really loved Jeralt. I hope she can bounce back…



Leonie: Captain Jeralt's gone. He's gone. And we'd only just reunited... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sure this is even harder on you. But I just can't– I can't believe...



Rhea: Professor... How are you holding up? I know how heavily grief weighs upon one's heart... I lost my mother some time ago. It was... Forgive me my moment of weakness. Even all these years later, I cannot recall that time without feeling the pain as if it were brand new. Just know that I am praying for your mind and your heart to find peace.



Seteth: First Tomas, and now Monica. I do have a theory, though I admit it is nothing more than speculation. Both Tomas and Monica have each gone missing at one time or another. It was reported that when Monica returned from her disappearance, she began to act like a completely different person. As if, perhaps, the real Monica had been killed and replaced by an impostor. Thinking of it like that, it is possible that this Solon had been impersonating Tomas for some time. How they managed such a convincing change of appearance, though, I still do not understand.



Flayn: You have lost your father... Now more than ever do I understand how very lucky I am that you were able to save me. Professor, I deeply appreciate what you have done. Thank you. If there is anything at all I can do in return, please tell me, OK?



Hanneman: You've lost someone very dear to you... I'm so... You have my sympathy. Manuela and I can take on some of your workload this month. We can't do all the teaching, but at least we can lighten the load for you. I've always seen strength in your eyes. I know you'll recover. You're a very strong person.



Manuela: I have something rather uncomfortable to discuss. It's about the weapon that killed Jeralt. Will you listen?
Byleth: I'll listen. 
Manuela: It was a dagger, but I know enough to know it wasn't an ordinary dagger. It wasn't made of iron or steel because... Well, because whatever it was, the wound it left wasn't normal. Who could make a blade like that, do you figure?
Byleth: I won't listen.
Manuela: I see... That's probably for the best.


Manuela: I wonder who they were...



Cyril: Oh Goddess, hear my prayer. Please receive this beloved person. When the cold rain washes the body, when the bird and wolf announce the dawn... Receive them into your blue blood. Receive them into a twinkling star. That's a mourning scripture from the Church of Seiros. Lady Rhea taught it to me. I pray that Jeralt is happy in the next world.



Anna: I heard Jeralt passed away... My deepest condolences. I knew him long before I ever even met you... He was always so much fun to be around... It's such a loss...

Gatekeeper: Professor... Thank you for all you have done for us. Nothing to report today. *sobs*

@Intro 
^start
Edelgard: Professor! I know where the enemy is... Where Solon is. They're in a place called the Sealed Forest, close to the monastery. The archbishop is gathering the knights to begin a search. She's doing so in secret, behind our backs.
Byleth: Why in secret?
Edelgard: She must be afraid that a thirst for revenge will compel you to seek them out. Now that you know, will you give us the order?
Rhea: No. I will not allow it.
Seteth: This discovery comes just when the knights are at their busiest. It is all too likely that our foes revealed themselves to lure you out there. They are the ones who took Jeralt from you… I know how you must despise them, but I must ask you to rein in your personal feelings for now.
Byleth: You can't stop me.
Rhea: Please, Professor. Do not act carelessly. I ask that you leave this to us. Losing you so soon after losing Jeralt would be unbearable.
Edelgard: Lady Rhea, our professor is not acting out of revenge. Sending us out there is the most strategic move we can make. You can't deny it. Most of the knights are still far away. Not only does our professor wield a Hero's Relic, but there is no one here who is more powerful. Seteth and the few remaining knights can't leave the monastery unattended. We have fought under our teacher's command countless times. We are the most effective army here, and we are already prepared for battle. We have no idea what the enemy is plotting. We must act now!
Rhea: Professor… Do you agree with this strategy?
Rhea: Understood. I will give you the order. Destroy the enemy that is hiding in the Sealed Forest… You have the protection of the goddess on your side. Whatever happens, you shall overcome.
Edelgard: Let's go, my teacher. Whatever happens, do not lose your conviction out there.

Dimitri: Professor, have you heard? They say we've finally located the enemy. It seems they're hiding in the sealed forest, right near the monastery. Lady Rhea has summoned all of the knights to return and take them down. And all of this is being done in secret. Why? To keep us...no, to keep you in the dark.
Byleth: Why the secrecy?
Dimitri: Lady Rhea likely assumed you wouldn't be able to stop yourself from confronting the enemy if you knew their location. But that is not how this story ends, is it? Professor... We're at the ready. Order us to depart, and we'll fight at your side.
Rhea: No. I will not allow it.
Seteth: This discovery comes just when the knights are at their busiest. It is all too likely that our foes revealed themselves to lure you out there. They are the ones who took Jeralt from you… I know how you must despise them, but I must ask you to rein in your personal feelings for now.
Byleth: You can't stop me.
Rhea: Please, Professor. Do not act carelessly. I ask that you leave this to us. Losing you so soon after losing Jeralt would be unbearable.
Dimitri: Lady Rhea, Seteth. Please, try to understand our reasoning before you refuse. With most of the knights still far away, we cannot afford for you two to leave the monastery undefended. The enemy's strength is yet unknown. The only warriors who likely stand a chance are those who wield Relics. With all that in mind, it's obvious who should be dispatched, is it not? If the professor leaves, we will go as well. We've already made preparations and are ready to depart at a moment's notice. Surely you must see that we cannot wait any longer for the knights to gather. Please... Do what must be done and give us the order.
Rhea: Professor… Do you agree with this strategy?
Rhea: Understood. I will give you the order. Destroy the enemy that is hiding in the Sealed Forest… You have the protection of the goddess on your side. Whatever happens, you shall overcome.
Dimitri: No matter what enemy we face, we will not fail. I promise you that.

Claude: Teach! Tomas… I mean…Solon and his lackeys. Their whereabouts have been discovered. Apparently they're lurking in the Sealed Forest, not too far from the monastery. Rhea has called back all of the knights who were out searching to round them up. Seems like it could take some time for them to make it back here…but she didn't ask for our help.
Byleth: Why keep it a secret?
Claude: Perhaps to prevent you from running headfirst toward revenge? It's only natural that you would leap at the chance for it. Anyone would.
Rhea: No. I will not allow it.
Seteth: This discovery comes just when the knights are at their busiest. It is all too likely that our foes revealed themselves to lure you out there. They are the ones who took Jeralt from you… I know how you must despise them, but I must ask you to rein in your personal feelings for now.
Byleth: You can't stop me.
Rhea: Please, Professor. Do not act carelessly. I ask that you leave this to us. Losing you so soon after losing Jeralt would be unbearable.
Claude: Listen, Rhea. Erm, Lady Rhea. This move is the most strategic. The military strategy I'm devising will soon echo across Fódlan's history. I'm sure of it. Just think about it. Most of the knights are still far away, and we can't afford to have Seteth and friends abandon the monastery. So the only person who can take action now also happens to be our best commander. It's Teach, and wherever Teach leads, we'll follow. And since you've taught us that this sort of thing is always a possibility, we're already prepared for battle. We can buy the knights more time. Not for revenge, but for a defensive attack on behalf of the monastery.
Rhea: Professor… Do you agree with this strategy?
Rhea: Understood. I will give you the order. Destroy the enemy that is hiding in the Sealed Forest… You have the protection of the goddess on your side. Whatever happens, you shall overcome.
Claude: We have our orders, Teach. Now all that's left is to pull out a miracle.

Hubert: We are now within the Sealed Forest. We must not let our guard down.
Bernadetta: Professor... We'll avenge Jeralt for you, no matter what!
Ferdinand: Remember--it is a bad idea to get distracted by revenge.
Petra: I have readiness. Our enemies will be taking...we will take our enemies down!
Linhardt: Well, it's not like we have any other missions this month. I suppose this is as good a way as any to spend our energy.
Caspar: Linhardt spending energy? We had better finish this fast before the pigs start flying everywhere.
Dorothea: Lower your voice. The enemy could be close!
Flayn: It is time to repay the kindness of the professor who saved my life!
Edelgard: Professor, I know I'm the one who insisted we come here, but don't doubt for a moment that the enemy is waiting for you.
Hubert: Lady Edelgard! What are you saying?
Edelgard: What other objective could they possibly have? We have no clue what kind of trap is waiting for us. Please be careful, my teacher. We can't afford to lose you...
Hubert: The enemy is strong, but you will prevail. You must.

Dedue: The Sealed Forest is up ahead. Stay alert.
Ingrid: This is for Captain Jeralt. I will not falter.
Flayn: It is time to repay the kindness of the professor who saved my life!
Ashe: Leave it to us, Professor. I'll give it my all.
Sylvain: Fighting Tomas... It will be difficult, that's for certain.
Mercedes: I don't really love the idea of fighting people I know...
Annette: We don't have a choice. Even if it's difficult, an enemy is an enemy. We've just got to get it over with!
Felix: Just kill them from behind. As long as you don't see their faces, you won't know if you know them.
Dimitri: We won't know unless we see their face... Yes, I suppose that is true. Professor... I hope you know I meant what I told you before. Your enemy is my enemy. And I will follow you until the end, whatever that end may be.
Byleth: That's reassuring.
Byleth: Let's do our best.
Dimitri: Yes...right. We'll fulfill our duty together. We've come this far. We can't stop now. I hope you know that you can rely on us. No matter who the enemy is, we are prepared to cut them down.
Dimitri: Yes... No matter who they may be...

Claude: The Sealed Forest is up ahead. Visibility is awful there, so everyone needs to be extra cautious.
Hilda: You seem to know a lot about it. It is just a forest, isn't it?
Claude: Have you been there too? Oh… Never mind. Listen, just like I told the archbishop, this is not a war of vengeance. It's a riddle, so to speak. Those guys are undoubtedly planning something terrible. We need some kind of clue as to what. The attack on the Holy Mausoleum. That foul business in Remire. The Demonic Beasts at the chapel… It can't go on. We need to figure out their objective and stop them from achieving it. That's our mission.
Lorenz: So, we have our mission now. We had better not fail.
Lysithea: It is a difficult task, but we will succeed.
Flayn: It is time to repay the kindness of the professor who saved my life!
Ignatz: An enemy whose objective you don't understand is a frightening prospect.
Raphael: We're gonna destroy 'em! It's our mission!
Leonie: I will have my revenge, whatever it takes. On that, I will never budge.
Marianne: Leonie… You will have what you seek.
Claude: I'll admit, vengeance sounds pretty nice. But don't forget that we're here for information. Luckily, we can easily find what we're looking for while getting revenge for Jeralt. Right, Teach?

@Opening 
In the pursuit of justice for Jeralt, you and your students find yourselves deep in the Sealed Forest.

@Battle
Edelgard: Look there! Demonic Beasts! I suppose they aren't holding back.

Dimitri: Demonic Beasts! The enemy was always intending to lure us here...

Claude: How kind of them to welcome us with Demonic Beasts. They're not playing around.

Monica: Hello! You're here! Welcome to the forest of death! My name is Kronya. This weakling girl was just a borrowed look for me.

Kronya: This is what I really look like! Now, you vermin... I'll take down every last one of you!


Kronya: If this takes too long, I might be forced to escape. Oh, or do you simply intend to let me go? How accommodating of you! As for me, I intend to kill you all. 

@Boss 
Kronya: How cute, you're trying so hard! But now it's time to die!

%Byleth,Kronya
Kronya: You're a fool to be so brazen. You'll never avenge your father at this rate. I'll have to kill you too! With my own hands!

%Edelgard,Kronya
Kronya: Huh? What are you-- Are you here to kill me?
Edelgard: I am. Prepare yourself for death while you still can.

%Leonie,Kronya
Leonie: Monica. You'll pay for what you've done.
Kronya: I told you! I am not Monica, I am Kronya! Do not call me by that fake name!
Leonie: I don't care what you're called. I don't care if it takes my last breath. I'll kill you.
Kronya: Please! My powers are beyond your comprehension. You're just a filthy worm!

@Cutscene 
Kronya: But how? How could I really lose...to a lowly creature like you?
Solon: Well.
Kronya: Solon! Don't just stand there and stare! I need your help!
Solon: Yes. You most certainly do.
Kronya: Huh?
Solon: Have no fear, Kronya. Your sacrifice will help to rid of this world of the filthy vermin that have long infested it.
Kronya: Solon... Stop this!
Solon: The time has finally come...to unleash the Forbidden Spell of Zahras upon our enemies!
Kronya: Please...help me...
Solon: Begone with you...Fell Star.

@Battle
^start
Edelgard: That could only have been magic! What happened to our professor?
Solon: They were swallowed by the mystical darkness of the forbidden spell. An eternity wandering in a void of darkness, never to return to this world... To think we almost had the Sword of the Creator...
Caspar: You're lying! Our professor is alive, I know it!
Flayn: That's right! Our professor is no ordinary human!
Hubert: It is hard to fathom that our professor would die in a place like this.
Solon: It is possible that death has yet to find your friend. But there are worse things than death. Drifting through the darkness with no chance to escape... Overwhelmed with hopelessness... It must be torturous.
Edelgard: You're already boasting a victory, but know this--if you did use such devious tricks to stop our professor... I swear that you will regret it.
Ferdinand: I cannot help but agree with her this once. Even if our professor is trapped in darkness, that is not the end of their story.
Solon: I will not forgive such arrogance. If you prefer it so, you shall also be added to the ranks of the dead!

Dimitri: What was that sorcery? What happened to our professor?!
Solon: They were swallowed by the mystical darkness of the forbidden spell. An eternity wandering in a void of darkness, never to return to this world… To think we almost had the Sword of the Creator…
Annette: That's a lie! There's no way the professor is really dead!
Flayn: That's right! Our professor is no ordinary human!
Dedue: I do not believe our professor has fallen.
Solon: It is possible that death has yet to find your friend. But there are worse things than death. Drifting through the darkness with no chance to escape…Overwhelmed with hopelessness… It must be torturous.
Dedue: We cannot abandon hope, Your Highness. Our professor lives. I know it.
Dimitri: You're right. We will save the professor. But first, let's destroy this fiend! I'll slice you into a thousand pieces as we watch with horror... You will know true pain before I finally allow you to die!
Solon: How trite. But if you wish for pain, I shall oblige. If you prefer it so, you shall also be added to the ranks of the dead!

Hilda: Wh-what was that? Where did you go, Professor?!
Solon: They were swallowed by the mystical darkness of the forbidden spell. An eternity wandering in a void of darkness, never to return to this world… To think we almost had the Sword of the Creator…
Lysithea: I don't believe anything you say! Our professor is still alive!
Flayn: That's right! Our professor is no ordinary human!
Claude: I refuse to believe that Teach would die in a place like this!
Solon: It is possible that death has yet to find your friend. But there are worse things than death. Drifting through the darkness with no chance to escape…Overwhelmed with hopelessness… It must be torturous.
Claude: Hey, all I hear is good news. Teach is still alive. And if that's true, then there's only one thing to do. Defeat you while we wait for Teach's triumphant return!
Leonie: Prepare yourself. We will avenge our leader here and now!
Solon: How trite. But if you wish for pain, I shall oblige. If you prefer it so, you shall also be added to the ranks of the dead!

@Battle 
Byleth: ...
Sothis: You fool!
Sothis: What were you thinking, charging right into an enemy's trap? Are you just a boulder that rolls down whatever hill it's on? No, even a boulder has more sense!
Byleth: I'm sorry.
Sothis: Apologizing won't make things right! This darkness is terrifying!
Byleth: I can explain...
Sothis: Excuses won't help us! This darkness is terrifying!
Sothis: As you and I are one... I, too, am trapped within this void. But please consider this... This realm of darkness we are in is seperate from the world from which you came. I mean that it would take a god to leave this place. In time, our hearts and minds will cease to be. Are you prepared to die?
Byleth: I am.
Sothis: How very brave of you, to joke at times like these...
Byleth: I am not.
Sothis: I thought as much. I also do not wish to die. And yet...
Sothis: There is no other choice...
Byleth: What choice?
Sothis: Do you recall your father's diary? He said you were a child who never cried nor laughed. I think I am the one to blame. I must have been asleep, but even then, I feel I was a part of you. I do not know how Rhea managed it, but she allowed me to exist inside of you. The truth is I have always been with you. It is within you that I found my power yet again. The power of a goddess. The power of the progenitor god.
Byleth: ...
Sothis: My name is Sothis. By now you must be well aware of what that means. I am the one who watches over Fódlan and the creatures dwelling there. I am Sothis, she who died then returned.
Byleth: I can't believe it.
Byleth: Somehow, I know it to be true.
Sothis: There is only one thing left to do to save us from this darkness of eternity. I must now use the power of a god. However, I lack a body of my own. And so, I must relinquish all the power that I have...to you. The time has come for you and I to join as one. And when that comes to pass...then I shall disappear.
Byleth: Disappear?!
Byleth: I won't allow it.
Sothis: When I say disappear, I do not mean that all I am will be no more. My soul will join with yours, and you and I will never be apart. But...I will no longer have a chance to speak with you. I shall miss it. So long have I been on this path with you. Through you, I got to see and hear this world. I even got to chastise you from time to time. I may not have acted like a goddess, but...it was certainly fun. For all that you have done... Thank you. I'm glad that it was you to whom my fate was bound.
Byleth: Thank you...for everything.
Sothis: Now... We must pray. For if we share this wish, our spirits two will join as one... Your wish...is to return to the forest, stop the enemy, and rescue the little ones. No need for words. I know your heart as though it were my own...

@Cutscene 
Sothis: Your will and mine are now as one. Both sides of time are revealed to you, and you alone.

Sothis: You know I am the beginning. What shall you do?

Solon: So the Fell Star consumes even the darkness itself...

@Battle 
Edelgard: Professor... It is you, right? I knew that you would always come back to us. I'd like to ask about your appearance, but for now, let's dispose of our enemies.
Solon: What did you see in the darkness of Zahras? This should be impossible. The only being that can withstand that darkness is... Unless I dispose of you myself, I may never have the chance to send you back there!

Solon: But this is not the end... Thales will carry out our mission, somehow...
Edelgard: It's over. Now, Professor. About your appearance...

Dimitri: Professor... That is you, isn't it? I am glad you are safe. I was sure that you would return. Please tell me all that happened to you later. For now, it's imperative that we kill the demon!
Solon: What did you see in the darkness of Zahras? This should be impossible. The only being that can withstand that darkness is... Unless I dispose of you myself, I may never have the chance to send you back there!

Solon: But this is not the end... Thales will carry out our mission, somehow...
Dimitri: Thales... Does he also serve the Flame Emperor? It can't be...

Claude: Teach... You are Teach, right? I always believed in you... I knew you could cut your way out of anything.
Solon: What did you see in the darkness of Zahras? This should be impossible. The only being that can withstand that darkness is... Unless I dispose of you myself, I may never have the chance to send you back there!

Solon: But this is not the end... Thales will carry out our mission, somehow...
Claude: I guess this is still far from over...

@Boss 
Solon: I have no time to waste on the likes of you...

Solon: To think...that I would lose to mere beasts.

%Byleth,Solon
Solon: I am terrified by you... Even though an emotion like fear has no place inside me. That means you must be eliminated.

%Edelgard,Solon
Solon: So this is how it is... I cannot let you live!
Edelgard: You stole the words from my mouth. You lost the moment you failed to kill the professor.

@End 
^start
Edelgard: That hair...and those eyes... You remind me of someone. What happened to you?
Byleth: The goddess gifted me her power.
Edelgard: The goddess? I see... Well, I'm happy for you. Your weapon is called the Sword of the Creator, after all. It's no wonder she looks favorably upon you. Just as it was with saint Seiros, no doubt... And just how will you use this new power, Professor?
Byleth: For the people of the world.
Edelgard: Heh, that is so like you to say that.
Byleth: For my students.
Edelgard: For us? I see...
Byleth: For myself.
Edelgard: That is no answer. You must use your power for something greater than yourself.
Edelgard: Tell me... If the world, and your students included, were to divide and go to war with each other, what would you do? In that scenario, each side would represent both the world and your students. Who would you--
Edelgard: Professor? Have you...fallen asleep?! This must be a side effect of your recent...changes. I can't just leave you here...
Edelgard: I shouldn't ask Hubert to carry you, so I suppose it falls to me...

Dimitri: Professor... I'm glad you're OK. And you seem relatively unscathed. I'm...I'm so relieved. What's more, Jeralt's foe is dead. Though we took little satisfaction from it. Professor... I must ask. What happened after we were separated? You look...different.
Byleth: The goddess gifted me her power.
Dimitri: The goddess appeared...and gave you her power? It's as though...the legend of old has been made flesh. It's hard to grasp, in all honestly. But having seen you pierce the sky with my own eyes, I find myself unable to doubt it.
Byleth: A legend of old?
Dimitri: Yes. The legend of Saint Seiros. It is said that she received a divine revelation from the goddess and was gifted with her power. Long ago, the goddess dispatched Seiros to defeat an evil king who went mad with power. Perhaps the goddess saw the goodness of Seiros within you too, and wished to help you in your quest to defeat evil. Hm. If you're Seiros, granted power by the goddess, then I suppose that makes me... Ah, never mind. I'm getting carried away.
Dimitri: Professor! What's wrong?! Are you...uh... Are you asleep? What is happening these days? Well, it matters not. We must get you help, and fast.
Dimitri: Sorry, Professor, but I have no choice but to carry you back.

Claude: Teach! We won! I'll be honest—when I lost sight of you, I broke into a cold sweat. But Jeralt's killer is dead. All's well that ends well.
Byleth: That's true.
Byleth: True…
Claude: You're kidding, right? I understood putting it off while we were in battle, but now that it's over, just go ahead and spit it out. That hair. Those eyes. That unfathomable power. What happened out there?
Byleth: I will tell you…
Claude: You mean to tell me…that an entity who claims to be the goddess was living inside your mind? And it's been that way since you were a baby? And this goddess entrusted all of her goddess-like power to you and then vanished…
Claude: It's a difficult story to swallow, Teach. But the way you look now… I guess I've got no choice but to believe it. How could something like that happen? There must be a clue in Jeralt's diary. If you believe the diary, there's a high possibility that Rhea did something to you when you were born. That's likely when all this began. What in the world happened to you as a baby? And what was Rhea after?
Claude: Teach! What's the matter?! Did you trip or… Wait. Are you sleeping? This must be an effect of the goddess's power. I wonder if Teach's body can handle the strain…
Claude: Think, Claude. What now? Should I carry him on my back? Easier said than done…
^end

Rhea:  In time's flow...see the glow of flames ever burning bright... On the swift river's drift, broken memories alight...

Rhea: Professor. You must remain still.
Byleth: Where am I?
Byleth: What happened?
Rhea: Everything is all right. There is no need to worry. Those who are trying to harm you are far away.

Rhea: ... How lovely...it would be for this moment to last forever... I wish I could hold on to this time we have stolen... that you and I could create a world without end... I have heard whispers of what happened to you. Your appearance... You have received power from the goddess. From the moment you took hold of the Sword of the Creator... I prayed that one day the radiant power of Sothis, which bathes Fódlan in its celestial light, might reside within you. But you are so much more than the light. You are my... Close your eyes, dear one. Sleep, just a while longer.

Rhea: I will be watching over you, always. Always and forever...
