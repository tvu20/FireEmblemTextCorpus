@Opening 
As cold air begins to creep in from the north of Faerghus, Fódlan welcomes the riches of fall. The women spend their days reaping the golden fields, gratefully embracing the bounty the goddess has once again provided. The men venture into the wild with horsebows and empty sacks ready to be filled with game.

@Dialogue 
Rhea: As I believe you are already aware, Seteth's younger sister, Flayn, has gone missing. At present, all we know for certain is that she has not left Garreg Mach.
Seteth: Flayn is not the type of person to just wander off on her own without telling me where she is going! We have searched the monastery thoroughly, but have found nothing. I am now mobilizing the knights to begin searching the town. Troubling rumors have been running rampant lately. I do not wish to consider the worst, but...
Byleth: Troubling rumors?
Byleth: What is it you're afraid of?
Rhea: There are rumors of someone prowling the streets and attacking innocents, night after night. The knights have investigated the matter. They have not discovered any remains, nor have they found any concrete evidence.
Seteth: The people are panicked! They all insist someone called the Death Knight is coming to claim their souls with his blade. There is no way she could have escaped unscathed if she were captured by such a fiend! Where is she?!
Rhea: Seteth, recall that impatience begets error. Please do your best to calm yourself. I think of your...sister as family as well. You know that. You have my support. We will devote ourselves fully–mind, body, and soul–to recovering her.  Professor. Your mission for this month is to help find Flayn. The knights have the town covered, so I ask that you focus your efforts on searching the monastery again. We do not have time to waste. You have your orders.

^start 
Hubert: Flayn has gone missing? Most unsettling.
Edelgard: It doesn't seem likely that she's simply gotten lost. I'll help in any way that I can.
Ferdinand: So, our mission this month is to find her? Well then, let us hurry and locate her before anyone else!
Bernadetta: I hope Flayn is OK! What would happen if... Just what would we do if...
Dorothea: You can't think like that, Bern. Seteth would have a heart attack if he heard you.
Linhardt: I've heard that she has a Crest, but I suppose, for this moment, that is irrelevant.
Hubert: We'll start by gathering information. Someone must have seen Flayn recently.
Edelgard: Right. If we work together, I'm certain we'll find her.

Dimitri: Flayn has disappeared? Seteth must be beside himself.
Sylvain: So finding little Flayn is our mission for this moon? Leave it to me, Professor. Chasing after girls is my specialty.
Ingrid: Sylvain... Even you must agree that now isn't the time for jokes.
Annette: I hope Flayn is OK. I've heard rumors about some Death Knight running around town...
Felix: Sounds intriguing. I had been hoping to cross blades with him.
Ingrid: Felix! Please consider how Seteth must be feeling right now.
Dimitri: In any case, we must start our search at once. Every moment matters. On your order, Professor, let's try to collect as much information as we can.

Hilda: What? Flayn is missing?!
Claude: So, finding Flayn is our mission for the month, I take it?
Raphael: Wait. Who's Flayn?
Leonie: Seteth's little sister. Surely you've seen her flitting about the monastery.
Lysithea: She is the girl who looks about the same age as me, but seems well beyond her years.
Hilda: Seteth is much older than Flayn. He's always looking out for her. He must be worried sick. If I were to go missing, I can't imagine what that would do to my brother.
Claude: When searching for someone, it's best to start by gathering information. Hopefully someone has seen Flayn.

Dedue: I'm on the lookout for suspicious individuals. The only place I've yet to check is the library.
Byleth: We'll go together.
Dedue: As you wish.
Byleth: Get some rest. 
Dedue: As you wish. After I check the library.

Dedue: Candlelight... And who is that?
Byleth: Is it Flayn?
Byleth: Is it the Death Knight?
Dedue: No, it isn't. Impossible...
Dimitri: Professor. Dedue. What are you up to at this hour?
Dedue: Your Highness! My apologies.
Dimitri: Oh, none necessary. I'm sorry for startling you. I was just doing some research. But I'm just about finished. I didn't realize how late it had gotten. We'd better head back to our quarters, Dedue. Until tomorrow, Professor.

Sothis: A most unusual man! Whatever could he have been looking for so late at night? Hm? That book is quite askew... He must have rushed to put it back upon the shelf.
Byleth: ...
Sothis: It seems to be a record of donations from nobility. Arundel... That's not a name I know. But look at that! This Arundel gave quite a sum each year... That is, until the year 1174. He must have died or fallen to financial woe. Hmm... I can't imagine what this has to do with Flayn.
^end

@Conversation 
Sothis: Oh my... Just one small girl who's gone astray has caused all this. We cannot let this stand. You must do all you can to find out where's she's gone. Now ask around to see what information you can find. Come now! No time to waste!

Edelgard: We must begin our search for Flayn, Professor. If she ran off on her own free will, that's her business. But that may not be the case. For her sake, I suggest we assume that she was abducted and begin an investigation. Who benefits from kidnapping her? Let's gather all the information we can on anyone who's been acting strangely.



Edelgard: Manuela ran off with Jeritza's mask? Hmm... We'll have to speak with both of them. But where could Manuela be? Jertiza is likely at the training grounds or in his quarters on the eastern side of the knights' hall.



Edelgard: Flayn is missing... We should split up and search for her. There isn't a moment to waste. We must find her before it's too late.





Dimitri: When I consider how Seteth must be feeling, my heart breaks. We must find Flayn as soon as possible. There are no signs of her having left the monastery, but we cannot safely rule out any possibility just yet. I'm wasting precious time standing about trying to think of a solution. I'll survey the monastery and see what information I can gather. There must be someone who has a clue as to Flayn's whereabouts.



Dimitri: What? Professor Manuela ran off with Professor Jeritza's mask? I have a bad feeling about this... We must find them both at once! Professor Jeritza will be at the training grounds or his quarters. I believe the latter can be found on the eastern side of the knights' hall.



Dimitri: I have thoroughly surveyed the entire monastery, and yet I have not found a single trace of evidence that suggests Flayn was abducted. Perhaps we must seek out personal recounts rather than physical evidence... In any case, we must hurry before something terrible happens.





Claude: No sign of her leaving the monastery, eh? That is, assuming we can actually trust that information...
Hilda: Oh, but I'm sure this space has no shortage of secret passages and hiding spots!
Claude: True. For now, there's not much we can do aside from making a thorough search of the monastery.
Hilda: Let's ask around and see what we turn up. You never know who might have seen something.



Claude: Professor Manuela ran off with Professor Jeritza's mask? What could that possibly mean?
Hilda: Well, that's suspicious! Sounds like we should try talking to them.
Claude: Professor Jeritza is almost certainly in the training grounds or his quarters. Where was that again? Oh, over on the eastern side of the knights' hall.



Claude: Flayn's gone missing? Where could she be? If it were an ordinary kidnapping, you'd think there'd be a demand for ransom or something by now. I don't like the sound of this...



Hubert: If Flayn has been taken hostage, then we know she is alive. At least for now. There would be no point to abducting her if simple murder was the objective. That's only logical, Professor.



Ferdinand: A beautiful, delicate maiden vanishing into thin air... It is like something out of a book. If it were a book, we would have no need to worry! She would be rescued presently by a dashing nobleman. Do you have any idea as to where she might be? Where she might have wandered off to?
Byleth: Perhaps she went looking for treats? 
Ferdinand: That is what I thought! Why I am here, in fact. But she is nowhere to be seen.
Byleth: To the greenhouse, for some flowers?
Ferdinand: Hmm, the greenhouse. I did not think of that. I will take a look around there later.



Linhardt: Flayn? No, I haven't seen her. She's been abducted. Oh, you're looking for her. Sorry, my mind was somewhere else. I just recently learned she has a Crest. Did you know that, Professor? If it was a particularly rare Crest, I could imagine Professor Hanneman would have quite an intense interest in her. Oh, no, I'm not accusing Professor Hanneman of abducting Flayn.



Caspar: I don't know if she ran off or got kidnapped or what! I just know that Flayn's in trouble. That's it! I can't keep sitting around. I gotta go find her! Now where do I start?

Bernadetta: Uh, Flayn's not in here! Ugh, I guess I have to let you in to prove it, don't I?

Bernadetta: There. See? No one's in Bernie's room but Bernie. Maybe Flayn just wanted to be alone for a while. Have you considered that? Come to think of it, where is her room, anyway?



Dorothea: Hey, Professor, have you seen Manuela? I saw her running off somewhere in a terrible hurry. I wonder if it has anything to do with Flayn's disappearance. Do you know, Professor?
Byleth: You're on first-name terms with Professor Manuela?
Dorothea: Oh, yes. Didn't you know? She was the senior diva in our Opera Company.



Petra: Flayn was childnapped. That is what you are thinking? And the villain is inside our monastery? Hmm. I must have admittance. One person...has been catching my eye. Shamir is a knight not like other knights. Her movements are being reminders of...no, they remind me of warriors of Brigid. Before she was here, what was she getting up to...



Dedue: I've heard the monastery is full of secret passages. If there is no sign of Flayn's departure, it's possible that she used one of those. Whatever has happened, I hope she is all right.



Felix: Ah, you're looking for Flayn's kidnapper. I can't say anything for sure, but I do have suspicions about Jeritza. There's something about how he's handling his blade lately. It seems more...impulsive than usual. It couldn't hurt to try speaking with him, at least. At this hour, I think you'll find him sparring with Catherine at the training grounds.



Ashe: I heard something like this happened last year too. Neither the culprit nor the missing student were ever found last time. Some people say it was the work of evil spirits.
Byleth: Maybe it was.
Ashe: D-don't say things like that, Professor! I'm sure the culprit is, you know, corporeal. We'll catch whoever it is!
Byleth: Then it could be the same culprit. 
Ashe: I thought the same. Could there be a connection?



Sylvain: Ow! Ingrid just about slapped the teeth out of my head. All I did was suggest that Flayn had eloped...
Byleth: Quite an insensitive joke.
Sylvain: Insensitive? I was just exploring possibilities!
Byleth: Is that a possibility? 
Sylvain: I don't know. I was just suggesting things, then suddenly I was seeing stars and Ingrid was yelling at me.



Mercedes: Do you really think Flayn was kidnapped?
Byleth: She must have been. 
Mercedes: I have a feeling you're right. We really need to find her, and quickly!
Byleth: There must be another explanation.
Mercedes: Do you think she ran off on her own? That doesn't put me any more at ease.



Annette: There have been a lot of rumors swirling around lately about a Death Knight who kidnaps people from the nearby town... You don't think Flayn was...you know. Do you?
Byleth: We can't rule it out. 
Byleth: I don't believe so.
Annette: Whether the rumors are true or not, I just hope our Flayn is safe...



Ingrid: To think that Flayn would disappear like this... Seteth must be worried sick. I haven't got much to go off of, and perhaps it's out of line for me to feel so uncomfortable... But something has been bothering me for a while about Gilbert. I feel as though I've met him somewhere before... I also noticed him staring intently at Annette once. Hmm...



Lorenz: If Flayn were taken hostage, I expect we would have received demands from the culprit by now. Perhaps this is not a kidnapping at all. Do you suppose she could have simply run away?
Byleth: That's possible. 
Lorenz: If that is the case, it is unlikely that we will find her anywhere in the monastery.
Byleth: I don't think so.
Lorenz: What could it be, then? What possible motive could there be to abduct her?



Raphael: I hope Flayn isn't going hungry. If someone really kidnapped her, I'll never forgive them! Now that I think about it, I saw Alois hanging out by the pond not too long ago. He was always getting into trouble for trying to talk to Flayn, you know. It's probably a crazy thought, but I'm starting to worry.



Ignatz: I've only ever spoken to Flayn a handful of times. She always seemed so naive about the ways of the world. I'm worried about her.
Byleth: You think she'd be easily deceived? 
Ignatz: Yes, I'm afraid so. I just hope she comes home safe.
Byleth: Do you have feelings for Flayn?
Ignatz: Wh-what makes you say that?! This is hardly the time for teasing, you know!



Lysithea: Reflecting on it now, Flayn has always seemed a rather odd person. She appears young, yet there's something about her that seems much older than her years suggest. And she's quite wise, but also surprisingly naive...
Byleth: Maybe she's lived a very sheltered life. 
Lysithea: Hmm, you might be right. Whatever the case, Seteth seems to care for her more than anything.
Byleth: Maybe she's actually a ghost.
Lysithea: A ghost?! Don't be absurd!



Marianne: Dear Goddess, hear my prayer... Please watch over Flayn... Please protect her...

Hilda: I bet Flayn ran away. She couldn't stand being held back by Seteth any longer. I can emphasize. I know what it's like to have an overbearing big brother.

Leonie: Where could Flayn have gone? Do you think she's really been kidnapped? I hear Tomas has been going around asking about her... But he's probably just worried like the rest of us. Though it wasn't just Flayn. He was asking about you and Captain Jeralt too.



Rhea: Professor, have you still not found any leads regarding Flayn's whereabouts? I have looked everywhere. Not even the knights on guard have seen anything of note.
Byleth: You're searching too?
Rhea: I, too, care for Flayn. She is like family to me.
Byleth: We will find her, together. 
Rhea: Yes, let us work together. It reassures me to have you by my side.
Rhea: May the goddess protect dear Flayn until she returns to us...



Seteth: ...
Byleth: I will find her. I swear it. 
Seteth: That is all I ask. Please, lend me your aid!
Byleth: Try not to worry.
Seteth: You ask the impossible. Oh, Flayn...
Seteth: She would have never left the monastery of her own volition. Why is there not a trace of her to be found?!



Alois: Hey there, Professor. Did you want to talk?  What?! Me, abduct Flayn?! You can't really believe I did that!
Byleth: Did you find anything in the pond?
Alois: Well, this may sound silly, but... I was too scared to even look. I couldn't bear the thought of finding her in its depths.
Byleth: I hear she was always yelling at you...
Alois: Oh, that's just because of my dumb jokes. She says that they're not very good. But if I went around kidnapping everyone who said that, the whole monastery would be empty!



Catherine: Did you hear about Flayn? It's just one thing after another this year, I swear. Some of the lower-ranked knights are searching for her in the town. If they find anything, I'll know.  What? Jeritza? Hm, come to think of it, I haven't seen him today. What would make you suspect him?
Byleth: That mask he wears is suspicious.
Byleth: I heard that he goes out every night. 
Catherine: I see. Well, I'll let the knights know.



Shamir: What brings you here? I'm taking a break.  Is this about Flayn? You find me suspicious? Hah.
Byleth: You're not from Fódlan.
Shamir: True. Your point being?
Byleth: What did you do before coming to the monastery?
Shamir: I was somewhere else. Fighting. Is that a problem?
Shamir: I understand that I don't fit in among the Knights of Seiros... But that hardly links me to Flayn's disappearance.

Shamir: Working hard, aren't you? I'll admit, I'm impressed. I can assist with any tasks, or help with your students

Shamir: On it. I'm available anytime I'm not on a mission with the knights.





Gilbert: Miss Flayn's whereabouts are unknown? I pray she is safe... We do not seem to have any leads at present.  I am one of the suspects, am I? Well, hopefully I can lay your suspicions to rest. Do you know of my, let's call it...unique situation?
Byleth: Your true identity?
Byleth: Do you mean Annette?
Gilbert: I was once a knight in service to the Faerghus royal family. If Ingrid believes she saw me before, it was likely in Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital. Annette is... She is my... But no, I would appreciate it, Professor, if you would ask no more.



Jeralt: Because of Flayn's disappearance, all of the knights are searching nonstop. But we haven't found a single lead. Seteth's face is getting paler by the minute. It's hard to watch.  What's that? You're looking for Manuela? Well, I did pass by her earlier. She was carrying something. A mask of some sort...
Byleth: Jeritza's mask?
Jeralt: I'm not close to the guy, so I can't say for sure. But come to think of it, you could be right.
Byleth: Flayn's mask?
Jeralt: Are you feeling all right? When have you ever seen Flayn wearing a mask?



Hanneman: Young Flayn's disappearance is most troubling.  What? Who would suspect me? You know what? I'll tell you who. A fool. That's who.
Byleth: Is her Crest rare enough to justify kidnapping her? 
Hanneman: Flayn's Crest, the Major Crest of Cethleann, is rare, but there are others who possess it.
Byleth: You have already investigated her thoroughly?
Hanneman: Alas, Seteth would never allow that. However, while Flayn's Major Crest of Cethleann is rare, there are other who possess it.



Tomas: Is something the matter? I see. So, Flayn has gone missing. I will do what I can to support the search.  Hm? It seems that you are a bit suspicious of me. Might I ask your reasons?
Byleth: Why were you asking about Flayn?
Tomas: I was away from the monastery for a few years, but do not forget... I have spent more than four decades in total working here at Garreg Mach Monastery. Yet it was not until recently that I learned that Seteth has a sister.
Byleth: Why were you asking about my father?
Tomas: It has been two decades since I last knew Jeralt, yet he looks nearly identical to my memory of him.
Tomas: It is only natural to be curious, don't you think? I assure you, there is nothing more to it than that.



Cyril: I can't believe Flayn just disappeared. I don't like it one little bit. Oh, are you here to see someone? Alois and Shamir and all the knights are gonna head into town soon.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Today...there is quite a bit to report! There is a masked individual who has been going into town every evening and not returning until the following morning. You see? Nothing gets past this guard! I doubt it has anything to do with Flayn's disappearance, but... Well, better safe than sorry, I always say.



Student: Professor! I saw him! A knight wielding a gigantic scythe! He was just like the rumors say! All covered in jet-black armor! It was the Death Knight, I just know it! You don't think he has something to do with Flayn's disappearance...do you?



Knight of Seiros: I can only imagine how worried Seteth must be, but isn't mobilizing the entire order of knights a bit...excessive? I was originally assigned to investigate those reports of the Death Knight in the town near Garreg Mach. When I think how many more victims that dastard might claim while we're all busy searching for Flayn... I'm sorry... That was insensitive. We're all under a lot of stress right now. It's important that we find her quickly.



Monk: I've served here at Garreg Mach in some capacity or another for several decades now. But after all that time, even I can't claim to know everything about the layout. Searching the entire interior of the monastery is a more difficult task than you may think. It makes you wonder who designed such a titanic compound. There are fragments of records remaining from its original construction, but none of them name an actual architect...



Monk: This might be the first time I've ever seen Seteth look so worn down. If poor Flayn was lured away by anyone... I personally think the clear suspect is that miscreant from Duscur. Those people are deceptive by nature...



Student: The whole monastery has been turned upside down! I wonder if we're still going to have the Battle of the Eagle and Lion next month. It's a yearly tradition, but with things the way they are right now...it's hard to imagine. At any rate, I hope they find Flayn soon.

@Intro
^start 
Edelgard: It seems Flayn is still missing. What could have happened to her?
Caspar: Everyone, hurry! I heard a scream from Professor Jeritza's room!
Sothis: Jeritza... Ah! The combat professor with the mask. He has always been rather suspicious. We must hurry!
Edelgard: Professor Jeritza? Are you there?
Hubert: He does not seem to be here... Hm? On the ground! Professor Manuela!
Byleth: Is she injured?
Byleth: Is she...dead?
Edelgard: No, She's unconscious. Someone clearly attacked her.
Hubert: Look at her hand. It looks as though she is pointing at something... There.
Edelgard: There's an opening behind that shelf. Perhaps a secret passageway...
Hanneman: What is the meaning of... Wait, is that Manuela? What happened here?
Edelgard: We know as much as you do. She needs to be taken to the infirmary.
Hanneman: Yes, of course–and quickly. Give me a hand, child.
Edelgard: Understood. I'll support her head. Professor, I'll be back shortly. Please be careful.
Caspar: Does this mean Professor Jeritza did it? Could he also have kidnapped Flayn?!
Hubert: We should start by investigating this passageway. Do you agree, Professor?
Byleth: Let's investigate.
Hubert: Agreed. The culprit could be hiding inside.
Byleth: We should call for the knights.
Hubert: We don't have time for that. It would be on us if the culprit escaped.
Caspar: That settles it! We'll take the offensive. Here we come, you monsters!
Hubert: Shall we, Professor?

Dimitri: We still don't know where Flayn is... But we can't give up. Not until she's found.
Ingrid: Professor! Your Highness! I just heard a scream! In Professor Jeritza's quarters!
Sothis: Jeritza... Ah! The combat professor with the mask. He has always been rather suspicious. We must hurry!
Dimitri: Isn't that... Professor Manuela!
Annette: Professor Manuela! Please wake up! Professor Manuela!
Byleth: Is she injured?
Dimitri: She's still breathing...but she needs medical attention immediately!
Byleth: Is she...dead?
Dimitri: No, I believe she's just unconscious. But this wound requires immediate attention!
Annette: Look! Do you see Professor Manuela's hand? It's like she's pointing at something...
Dimitri: I see it! Behind that shelf! Could it be a secret passage?
Hanneman: What is the meaning of... Wait, is that Manuela? What happened here? We must take her to the infirmary immediately. You! Don't just stand there! Help me carry her.
Dimitri: Of course. I'll return shortly, Professor.
Annette: Do you think this is related to Flayn's disappearance?
Dedue: What should we do, Professor?
Byleth: Let's investigate.
Annette: It looks dark...uh...dark in there.
Mercedes: Aw, you've always been scared of dark places, haven't you, Annie? But don't worry! The professor and I will protect you.
Byleth: We should call for the knights.
Annette: You're right. We should call for help.
Ashe: But the culprit could flee while we wait! Sh-shouldn't we take a look?
Dedue: There are sounds coming from within. If we're going to investigate, now is the time.
Mercedes: We'll be OK, I'm sure of it. Are you ready, Professor?

Claude: There's still no sign of Flayn... What should we do, Teach? I'll admit, I'm out of schemes here.
Ignatz: Professor! Claude! Something's very wrong. Please hurry to Professor Jeritza's room!
Claude: Knock, knock. Is anybody...whoa! Professor Manuela!
Ignatz: I heard a scream coming from here just moments ago. It must have been Professor Manuela!
Byleth: Is she injured?
Claude: She's unconscious. She was clearly attacked by someone.
Byleth: Is she...dead?
Claude: No, I believe she's just unconscious. It looks like she was attacked by someone.
Hilda: Hey! It kind of looks like Professor Manuela is...pointing at something.
Claude: So we follow where she's pointing and... Oh? What do we have here? There's a rather suspicious hole behind that shelf.
Hanneman: What is the meaning of... Wait, is that Manuela? What happened here? We must take her to the infirmary immediately. You! Don't just stand there! Help me carry her.
Claude: Right, right. Hold down the fort for me, Teach. I'll be back once we get Professor Manuela taken care of.
Ignatz: What could have happened here? And where is Professor Jeritza?
Hilda: This must be related to that girl's disappearance. What if she's being held captive down there? No, no, that's crazy... Right?
Byleth: Let's investigate.
Ignatz: Right... It's scary, but... OK.
Hilda: Don't be a coward, Ignatz. We'll be fine as long as we stick close to the professor.
Byleth: We should call for the knights.
Ignatz: But...what if something bad happens while we're searching for the knights?
Hilda: You mean, like, a captured girl being strangled or something?
Ignatz: Ah...you're right. What should we do?
Hilda: We've got to investigate. Lead the way, Professor.
Ignatz: The culprit may be hiding inside, so let's be extra cautious!

Hubert: I never would have imagined... Hm? I see someone. They're unconscious.
Byleth: Is it Flayn?
Hubert: Yes, and there is someone else too. It appears to be another student.
Byleth: Is it Jeritza?
Hubert: No, Professor. It's two young girls.
Caspar: Someone's coming! I recognize that scythe and mask... It's that jerk we fought at the Holy Mausoleum!

Annette: What is this place? It's so...BAH! I see someone! I think...they're unconscious.
Byleth: Is it Flayn?
Ingrid: Yes, I see Flayn! But...who is this other person?
Byleth: Is it Jeritza?
Felix: Are you blind? They're obviously female. And there are two of them.
Annette: Professor! Someone's coming from farther in! That scythe... Is that the knight who attacked the Holy Mausoleum?

Hilda: It's way too creepy down here. And it smells funny. And...BAH! A person! They're...unconscious.
Byleth: Is it Flayn?
Hilda: Yes! It's Flayn! Oh, but there's someone else too...
Byleth: Is it Jeritza?
Hilda: Look closer, Professor. There are two girls.
Ignatz: Someone is coming! That scythe... Could it be the knight we fought at the Holy Mausoleum?

Death Knight: That sword. You must be... One of us will die, the other will live. I will enjoy this dance of damnation.

@Opening 
The monastery is shocked to learn that Seteth's younger sister, Flayn, has gone missing. After an exhaustive search for clues, you finally come upon a lead...

@Battle 
Hubert: Our objective is to recover Flayn. Let us hope we are not too late.

Hubert: Hmm. Something odd about the floor over there. What will happen if we step on it?

Hubert: Contraptions in the floor. Stay alert.

Hubert: Interesting apparatus. I wonder if we can operate it.

Flame Emperor Soldier: So, you have come! I'll make sure you never leave!


Dedue: That knight looks like death itself. We must rescue Flayn immediately.

Dedue: There's something strange about the flooring at the end of the corridor. Something might happen if you step there.

Dedue: Some kind of contraption has been activated.

Dedue: What is this device? It appears operational.


Hilda: Professor, we need to defeat the Death Knight, and then rescue Flayn!

Hilda: Hm. Look at that strange tile over there. I bet something will happen if you step on it.

Hilda: Whoa. Look at those weird contraptions on the floor.

Hilda: I wonder what that is? Looks like you can use it, but who knows what'll happen.

Death Knight: I have no need of you...

Death Knight: Now, you will die together... How joyous...

Death Knight: You are getting in the way of my game.
???: Hmph. You'll have more opportunities to play soon. Your work here is done.
Death Knight: Understood. I will go...
???: We will cross paths again. I am the Flame Emperor... It is I who will reforge the world.

Linhardt: Flame Emperor? Rather worrisome that he sounds intent on showing up again.
Ferdinand: Are they both OK? We should get them out of here.
Hubert: The enemy's withdrawn. Let's carry them up.

Mercedes: Flame Emperor and the Death Knight? I have to say, they both looked very dangerous.
Ingrid: Where did they go? It doesn't matter. We need to get these two out of here.
Dedue: Bring them up.

Lorenz: Flame Emperor, eh? Seemed quite frightened of us if you ask me! Haha!
Leonie: He's gone. We should get these two out of here.
Hilda: Let's get out of this horrible place! C'mon, we can carry them up.

Linhardt: They're pale, and their pulse are slow... Still, I don't believe their lives are in danger.
Edelgard: You found Flayn? Where?!
Ferdinand: You missed the most important part of the mission! We found her within that secret passage. The culprits were the Death Knight and...what was his name? Ah, the Flame Emperor. Sadly, they got away.
Edelgard: All that matters is Flayn's safety. Right, Professor?
Byleth: Right.
Byleth: I wanted to catch them.
Edelgard: It is unfortunate. If only you could have waited for me to return...
Hubert: We will take these two to the infirmary. Professor, please inform Seteth.
Edelgard: Whatever the circumstance, I'm glad Flayn is safe. Though I'm curious to find out who that other girl is... Huh, Professor? Is that...a smile?
Edelgard: Heh, you look...happy. I don't think I've ever seen you like this before. Anyhow, we should hurry to Seteth. He must be beside himself by now.

Mercedes: Thank goodness. Those girls are pale as ghosts, but at least they're alive. But that Death Knight person...feels so familiar.
Dimitri: You found Flayn?! Thank goodness!
Annette: She was unconscious at the end of that secret passage. We found the culprit too...but he got away.
Byleth: No use dwelling on it.
Byleth: We almost had him.
Dimitri: I'm just grateful that everyone is safe. That's what matters most. I'd like to hear what transpired, but first we need to get these ladies to the infirmary.
Dedue:  Understood. We'll go at once.
Dimitri:  I'm...I'm sorry, Professor. I'm so relieved, I suddenly felt weak. I couldn't be happier with how things turned out. And I imagine no one will be more overjoyed than Seteth. Hm. Hey, Professor. Can you make that expression one more time?
Byleth: Like this? 
Dimitri: I don't think I've ever seen your face like that.
Byleth: No.
Byleth: I don't think I can...
Dimitri: Heh, I apologize. I've forgotten myself and come dangerously close to teasing you. It's just...I've never seen you look so happy before. It's downright mesmerizing. Ah, but this isn't the time for idle chitchat. We must hurry and share the good news with Seteth!

Marianne: They're both alive... Thank goodness.
Claude: You actually found Flayn?! Nice work!
Lorenz: It is a shame you could not be there, Claude. I would have liked for you to witness our mortal struggle against the Death Knight.
Byleth: He got away.
Byleth: We could not defeat him.
Claude: Hey, at least we managed to rescue Flayn and complete our mission. That's what counts, right? Right! Excellent work, everyone! Now then, let's get these limp ladies to the infirmary, shall we?
Raphael: No problem. I can carry them both at once.
Lysithea: Be gentle with them, Raphael! Let us carry each one individually. And slowly.
Claude: You know, Teach, seeing you smile sure makes me feel better. You look happy for a change. Hm? Do you really not know? Well, truth is, I've never seen you smile before now. At times, it made me wonder whether you were even human. But I suppose that was just my imagination running wild. Anyhow, we've probably kept Seteth waiting about as long as he can stand. Let's hurry up and tell him the great news.

@Dialogue 
Seteth: Professor... Please, allow me to express my eternal gratitude once more. Flayn is safe and sound, and I have you to thank for that. Mere words could never express how thankful I am. I...I am indebted to you.
Byleth: I couldn't have done it without the students.
Seteth: Yes, of course. I shall express my gratitude to the students as well.
Byleth: I'm just happy she's safe.
Seteth: Yes, indeed. I...I, too, am overjoyed.
Byleth: But why was Flayn taken to begin with?
Seteth: Her kidnapper was the masked knight who vanished during the Rite of Rebirth. The one known as the Death Knight. Considering the circumstances, it seems plausible to assume that his true identity is Jeritza. And we cannot forget about the mysterious Flame Emperor... His true motives are yet unclear. However, I have an idea. I believe the enemy may have been after Flayn's blood. The blood that flows through her veins is special. It is extremely rare...and extremely dangerous. If enemies who know the secret of Flayn's blood have appeared, our only option is to leave the monastery and go into hiding.

Flayn: Brother, wait.
Seteth: Flayn?! What are you doing here? You should be resting!
Flayn: I do not like the path of your thoughts. I do not wish to live in some lonely, remote location where I never get to see anyone. Not ever again.
Seteth: If we stay here, you may be targeted again! Wouldn't it be better for the two of us to live in peace?
Flayn: Even if we ran off to some new, secret location, there is no guarantee that they would not find us. That is why I believe it would be safest to stay in the monastery, where we are surrounded by capable knights and professors.
Seteth: I see your point, I do. However...
Flayn: You know it is the only reasonable option. What if I were to join the professor's class?
Byleth: That is a great idea. 
Flayn: You think so too? I am so very pleased to hear that! With a professor like you nearby, I shall be safe no matter what foe should appear!
Byleth: Why would you do that?
Flayn: Because, with a professor like you nearby, I shall be safe no matter what foe should appear!
Seteth: I see. I am afraid you have a good point. Professor... Due to my position, I have closely scrutinized everything about you. After all that has happened, I must admit that you are indeed...a trusted ally. So, what say you? Can I entrust you with Flayn's safety?
Byleth: It would be my pleasure. 
Byleth: I suppose I have no choice.
Sothis: I am so glad that Flayn is safe. Yet I can't help but wonder what the story is about the other girl. She wore the uniform of the academy. But who is she?

Rhea: Well done, Professor. I see that I was right to ask your class for assistance. I have been told that Manuela and Flayn are recovering nicely, as is Monica.
Byleth: Is Monica a student here?
Byleth: Who is Monica?
Rhea: Monica, the girl you rescued along with Flayn, is also a student at the Officers Academy. However...
Hanneman: She is a student from last year's class. She went missing just before she would have graduated. It never occurred to us that something might have happened to her at the monastery. We assumed she had run away. I never dreamed that we would find her. Not like this.
Rhea: Monica has asked to rejoin the Black Eagle House once she has fully recovered. Our enemies are still out there, so we must remain cautious and continue our investigation. However, we must also help the students to move on from this incident.
Hanneman: After all, the Battle of the Eagle and Lion will be held in Gronder Field next month.
Rhea: Yes. The students will remember it for the rest of their lives. Please guide them so they may show us their best at the coming battle.

Jeralt: So, you'll be going to Gronder Field next month. You've never been there before, have you? There is unease in the western side of the Empire, but everything east of the capital, Enbarr, is stable. Well, there was a noble rebellion a short while ago, but it didn't amount to much.
Byleth: What will you do next month?
Jeralt: I have my own mission. The church has always been quick to make use of those who work for them.
Byleth: Will you come to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion?
Jeralt: Sorry, but I've got my own mission, and it's far from Gronder Field. The church has always been quick to make use of those who work for them.
Jeralt: What I'm more concerned about is finding out who among us is pulling the strings. Ever since the Rite of Rebirth, strange groups have been seen around Garreg Mach, and elsewhere too. There was also an incident where some knights investigating these suspicious strangers...turned up dead. Not that it's likely, but if something like that ever happens to me... Search this room. Every corner. Behind every shelf. I'm going to leave something for you.
Byleth: Don't say things like that. 
Jeralt: Don't get me wrong. I have no intention of dying. I know it would be too much to ask you to cheer up, but can you at least drop the serious...  Well, I'll be. Was that a smile just now?
Byleth: I promise.
Jeralt: Don't just nod solemnly. There's nothing to worry about. I'm just being cautious. Then again, I guess you're always solemn.
