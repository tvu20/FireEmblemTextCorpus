@Opening 
Claiming the monastery at Garreg Mach as its home base, the Alliance army joins forces with the Knights of Seiros. Together, they begin to take up arms against the Adrestian Empire.

@Dialogue 
Claude: Good work, Hilda! You didn't do much manual labor, but you managed to rope the knights into helping us restore the monastery.
Hilda: Thanks, Claude, but all I did was piggyback on your scheme. I saw your eyes telling me to make some magic happen!

Alois: Thank you so much for your help with the restoration.
Hilda: Oh please, it was nothing! We're just doing our part as former students.
Catherine: I'm told you even routed the bandits. That job should have fallen to us. I'm sorry for the trouble.
Claude: Hey, don't think twice about it. We're all allies in the resistance against the Empire, right?
Catherine: The church is at war with the Empire, but let's be realistic. Wouldn't it be better for the Alliance to eventually submit?
Claude: The way I see it, the emperor wants to take over all of Fódlan and destroy the existing order of the world. I can't see her allowing the Alliance to continue to exist. We're in this just as deeply as you are. Actually… We were hoping to use this place as a base. The Empire begs to be meddled with, and we're first in line.
Alois: What? Why would you want to make your base here of all places?
Claude: Garreg Mach is situated in the center of Fódlan, both geographically and spiritually. We want to secure this location while the Empire is still overlooking it.
Catherine: I see. The Empire doesn't see this place as important at the moment because it's far from the front lines.
Claude: But if we simply decide that it's ours to occupy, that does nothing to inspire the hearts and minds of the people of Fódlan. Luckily, good ol' Teach has finally returned to us. If the Professor Rhea entrusted with the Sword of the Creator fights at our side… Well now. That's a just cause anyone could get behind. What's more, here we are, working alongside the legendary Knights of Seiros. It smacks of divine providence, doesn't it? Can you feel it?

Seteth: I have heard what you have to say, Claude. And you, Professor? Where do you stand?
Byleth: I will fight the Empire.
Seteth: Hm. On our own, we lack sufficient military strength. But with the help of the Alliance…
Byleth: I will find Rhea.
Seteth: Hm. We are at a relative standstill, but with the help of the Alliance…
Seteth: The archbishop said if anything should happen to her, that we should entrust the affairs of the church to you. If you intend to fight alongside the Alliance, then I will follow you as well. Is that acceptable, Claude?
Claude: Of course. I can't think of anything more reassuring than having both Teach and the knights on our side. Together, we'll stop the emperor and her reckless ambitions!

@Conversation 
Claude: Hey there, my friend. It's funny how the monastery was once in ruins, but now it's downright bustling. Thanks to a little promise five years ago, our buddies have all gathered, and even the knights have returned. It's like we were all just waiting for you to awaken. And now we're all going to band together against the Imperial army. You should go and talk to everyone, if you can. There may be some who are still on the fence.



Lorenz: I have written to my father to signal my intention to remain here. Not that I require his approval to do so. There is not much for me to gain by returning to Alliance territory now. But by staying, I will be able to influence the course of events directly, on the field of battle.
Byleth: Will you get along with the Alliance leader?
Lorenz: We will not be friends, but I will cooperate with him as much as is necessary to secure victory.
Byleth: Will you keep an eye on the Alliance leader? 
Lorenz: Naturally. Someone needs to make certain he does not lead the Alliance to ruin.



Raphael: Fighting alongside you and everyone else is a dream come true, Professor! And don't worry about my little sis. Right now she's back home helping out with the family business. I kinda figured I was gonna be stuck going back and taking over for her. But thanks to you and Claude, I get to work on my dream of becoming a proper knight!



Ignatz: It's been fixed up quite a bit, but it's battle scars aren't so easily erased... To think that a glorious cathedral, with a thousand year history... would end up like this. I'll rebuild this place someday. This cathedral is the symbol of Fódlan. Maybe I should paint a picture of the beautiful cathedral of old, while I still remember what it looked like...



Lysithea: I've grown weary and impatient - these past five years, my hands have been bound. But now, I can finally take action with a clear goal. I'm grateful to you and to everyone.
Byleth: I didn't do anything. 
Lysithea: Nonsense. Your presence steeled everyone's resolve.
Byleth: And that goal is?
Lysithea: Down with the Empire! Surely peace will soon follow if the Empire is overthrown. Then my parents can finally find peace themselves.



Marianne: Even with the church in shambles, we can still pray. The goddess will surely hear our prayers, but still... I hope the church can return to it's former beauty someday.



Hilda: I'm pretty headstrong, but Claude could give me a run for my money. I mean, he's dragged the knights into this. You ought to be careful, Professor.
Byleth: I'll be fine.
Hilda: I wonder if you've got a hidden headstrong side? You must be hiding it really well though.
Byleth: You too. 
Hilda: Don't worry about me. I'm here because I want to be. Also because being around my big brother feels like a real chore.



Leonie: It's not just for my village that I'm fighting alongside you here, you know. It's also that Captain Jeralt asked me, his first and greatest apprentice, to look out for you. Of course, it wouldn't be enough just to keep you alive. It's my duty to make sure you win too. So do your best, Professor. And count on me to watch your back.



Ferdinand: I have lost my dominion. My nobility may seem like nothing more than a title. But I will never lose my noble heart. I will stop Edelgard, even if it costs me my life. I have turned my blade against her now. I cannot go back on that decision. Professor… Do you think I chose the wrong path?
Byleth: Not at all.
Byleth: We'll find out soon enough. 
Ferdinand: You are right…



Linhardt: The promise was made five years ago, but I must say I'm rather surprised how many of us managed to make it. Personally, I only showed up because I hoped to see you again, Professor. I've been with my family in the Empire until recently. I admit to feeling a little guilty betraying Her Majesty...but only a little. Now that we're all together again, I suppose the fighting will begin soon.



Caspar: Hey, Professor! You won't believe what happened! I figured I couldn't go back to the Empire after Garreg Mach fell, so I started drifting across the Kingdom and Alliance. Then, I just happened to run into our old class, so we came back to the monastery together!


Bernadetta: Ah, at last, I return to my domain! My lonely paradise! My realm of exquisite Solitude! Huh? Professor? Is that, um. Is that you? You, um. You didn't hear that just now, did you?
Byleth: Sorry.
Bernadetta: Oh! Forget you heard anything!
Byleth: Hear What? 
Bernadetta: Right. You didn't? Well, um. Good.



Dorothea: Laaa-la-laaa-la-laaa... Professor! Oh my! It's so good to see you. These days, so many old friends seem to be disappearing. But you... You're here! It's incredible to see you again after five years! I have a feeling your name will go down in history.



Petra: Edelgard is controlling the Empire. She is putting the pressure on the Kingdom and Alliance. Empire and religion are at open war. It will be… difficult for us at first. But corrupt nobles are many. That means the common people will rebel and be joining our side. With you, Professor, the battle tides will…ah, will turn. I have certainty.



Felix: A country with no king has no future. That's why I made my way here. Professor, don't let me down.
Byleth: Country with no king?
Felix: Hmph. You'll understand soon enough.
Byleth: Let's forge ahead. 
Felix: Yes, let's. Find me a worthy opponent to battle and I'll be content.



Sylvain: I'm the heir of House Gautier, and I'm fighting alongside a bunch of Alliance people? I can just imagine my father's face contorted in anger and the delightful words he must have used to describe me. I don't know how standing and fighting for Faerghus would have helped. Sorry, Professor. I don't regret my decisions. I'm just thinking out loud. And I'm hoping I haven't made a big mistake.



Mercedes: You're here, Professor, along with everyone from our old class. It's like we've gone back in time! When I think that I'll be around you again, all of my sorrows just drift away.
Byleth: Frankly, I don't feel too happy.
Mercedes: Hmm, I understand. Especially with Lady Rhea missing...It sounds like the Kingdom and Empire have been in a sorry state too. But we can't let that get us down!
Byleth: Let's do our best together.
Mercedes: Hmm, yes. I'll at least try not to hold anyone back.
Mercedes: Let's work together for the common good, like we did five years ago!



Annette: Members of the knights tell me that Father left their ranks five years ago. They say he announced he was returning to the Kingdom, but nobody’s heard from him since. I haven’t received word that he went back to Mother… Where could he be… Where are you, Father…



Ingrid: Professor. I have a proposal. Why not go beyond the Knights of Seiros—instead, uniting with allies from all across Fódlan to fight for our cause? Looking back, it would have been best to ally with the Kingdom and join forces against the Empire. But now the Kingdom is not exactly… Well…



Seteth: Five long years, I've searched for you and the archbishop. It's a pleasure to see you again. The Church of Seiros will follow you from now on, but please do not abandon the search for Lady Rhea.
Byleth: We'll do whatever it takes to find her. 
Seteth: Thank you. I know the battles ahead will be dire, but we will support you with all our strength.
Byleth: We don't know what the future will bring.
Seteth: Wherever she is, Rhea is doubtlessly waiting for you. Please do not let her down.



Flayn: Professor, I am so glad you are unharmed! No matter the path you walk, I will be with you every step of the way. Anything you ask of me, I shall see it through. You saved my life, and I am in your debt.



Hanneman: Thankfully, it appears the records and equipment I need for my research have not been damaged. I am most curious though. You say you were asleep for five whole years? Incredible. Perhaps this is another effect of your Crest. I do look forward to investigating you in greater detail.
Byleth: We can talk about that. 
Hanneman: Wonderful news! I am most excited to begin. We must find the time, of course.
Byleth: Uh, maybe later...
Hanneman: I'll have to be content with observing you wherever you go, then. I cannot waste any opportunity!



Manuela: My, Professor. You haven't changed a bit! At your age, I'd expect your whole demeanor to have changed greatly over five years... Though I suppose I haven't changed either, right? Thank you for noticing, by the way. Ah, Just the two of us, forever young. Oh, let me have my fun.



Alois: I'd given up on ever seeing you again. Where have you been hiding? Anyway, now that we're reunited in the land of the living, I must fulfill my promise!
Byleth: What promise?
Alois: The promise I made to the captain! to keep you safe! I can't believe you've forgotten. How cold...
Byleth: Right, the Promise. 
Alois: That's right! I promised the captain I'd protect you in his stead, and now I'll make good on my word!



Catherine: In Lady Rhea's absence, I will follow you. That's what she would want me to do. Know that wherever you might lead us, I'll continue searching for Lady Rhea.
Byleth: That's fine. 
Catherine: Good, because I will not budge on that point. Welcome back, Professor.
Byleth: Sounds like a lot of trouble.
Catherine: I don't care how much trouble it is! I will rescue Lady Rhea, at all costs.



Shamir: I'm more of a mercenary than a knight these days. I work to get paid. I never was too attached to Fódlan. I was considering leaving soon... But I might change my mind if you're around.



Cyril: I don't know anything about rebuilding, but I can sure do my best to clean up the mess. I'm gonna keep Lady Rhea's room spotless, so she can use it right away whenever she gets back. You gotta find her, Professor. You just gotta.



Anna: There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! You know, it's such a thrill to be able to greet you like this again! I almost died as well in the battle five years ago, but I won't allow any enemies to get into this place again, I promise you that! Even if the Death Knight shows up, I'll be sure to... Well, for now I'll keep training so I can eventually feel confident that I can stop him!


@Intro 
Claude: Everyone, listen up! I have a proposal. We are now building our forces in order to rise up against the Imperial army. But it wouldn't be smart for us to fight under the banner of the Alliance. That would only incite the lords who support the Empire. We've also combined forces with the Knights of Seiros. Therefore, I suggest that we operate under a new symbol. That's why I've prepared this...

Claude: You may recognize it as the Crest of Flames, which resides in Teach. The phantom Crest that has reappeared after more than 1,000 years. We're attempting our own miracle, so it seems like a suitable symbol for us. So... Until we welcome the dawn of a new age in Fódlan... Let's fight to the very end, as one, under the symbol of the Crest of Flames!
Hilda: Impressive, Claude. Forget restoring the monastery. You've somehow roped everyone into fighting back against the Empire!
Claude: If you recall, I never asked anyone to join us. If anything, we have Teach's achievements to thank. Now that you mention it, I guess I should express my gratitude.


Claude: Hey, friend. So this is where you've been. Without you, the knights never would have joined our cause. I could never pay you back for that.
Byleth: You're welcome.
Byleth: Let's do our best.
Claude: Just leave it to me, Teach. When this fight is over, I plan to see all of my dreams come to fruition, and yours as well.
Byleth: What are you dreams, Claude?
Claude: Well, for example... to bust open Fódlan's Throat. There's a massive fortress there, which is responsible for protecting the eastern border of the Alliance. I like to think of it as a lid on a bottle. The people of Fódlan only know a small part of the world. Their prejudices are born because they don't know what lies beyond their borders. And the opposite is true too. Those outside of Fódlan don't know about this place. Ignorance breeds discrimination. Whether you look inside the bottle or outside of it... If you really look, all you find are people who you can get along with, if you only try. That's why I wanna bust open that lid, which is keeping us locked inside. Or destroy the bottle entirely.
Byleth: Are you going to tell our allies about this?
Claude: I'll find the right time to bring it up. Even if I talked about it now, it doesn't seem realistic, does it? First we need to defeat the Empire and restore peace to... Huh?
Leonie: Professor! Claude! We're under attack!
Claude: I guess we'll have to cut our conversation short. What's going on, Leonie?
Leonie: It's a small group, but some Imperial troops are headed this way. It looks like they were stationed nearby.
Claude: I got to hand it to Edelgard. Nothing gets past that woman.
Byleth: We should proceed cautiously. 
Claude: As long as we don't let our guard down, there's no way they can defeat us.
Byleth: Let's take them down. 
Leonie: All right! I'll show you how much I've improved, Professor!
Claude: This will be our first battle alongside the Knights of Seiros. Let's kick off our new partnership with a magnificent victory!

@Opening
Though plans to resist the Empire are still being devised by the Alliance army, the Imperial army has already anticipated their next move. An Imperial vanguard, just outside Garreg Mach, led by General Randolph, begins to advance with the aim of toppling the monastery once again.

Fulfilling a promise made five years ago, your former students gather once more at the monastery, as do the knights. However, your joyful reunion is cut short...

@Battle 
Randolph: The Knights of Seiros are a powerful enemy, but we have more soldiers. We'll take them down all at once!
Claude: So, the enemy intends to use their overwhelming numbers to defeat us. Let's fight fire with... actual fire.

Knight of Seiros: Report! The enemy has entered the periphery of Garreg Mach!
Claude: If they reach the interior, the enemy will take the monastery. Drive them back immediately!

Imperial Soldier: What? That strange battle flag is... But isn't our enemy the Church of Seiros?
Randolph: They didn't have enough soldiers with just the church, so they upped their numbers by joining with those filthy rogues. It doesn't matter what flag they fly. They're nothing more than a mob. We'll destroy them all!


Claude: Allied soldiers are making preparations for the plan. Protect them!

Claude: What? The fire attack unit was routed?! Damn it...my brilliant plan failed.
Randolph: It looks like they were planning something, but it failed!

Claude: We're prepared for the fire attack. Now we just need to draw the enemy's attention. You can't defeat us with that many soldiers? The Imperial army is doomed without a capable general!
Randolph: Quiet! Don't think you'll get away with mocking me! Attack! Make sure they never speak again!
Claude: Now!

Randolph: Argh, a fire attack... The damage is too great. We can't fight anymore! All units, retreat! I'll take on our pursuers! Carry away the injured soldiers!


Claude: If we let them escape, they'll come back to attack later. We have to take them out!
Victory Conditions: Defeat the enemy commander.


Randolph: A total loss... But we can't just return home like this...
Claude: Teach, look out! They're after your head!

@End 
Claude: Phew! Nice work. We won without much incident, thanks to all of you.
Knight of Seiros: I don't think the Empire will leave us alone now. What do you plan to do?
Claude: I intend to ask the Alliance lords to share some troops with us to bolster our forces.
Lorenz: I will speak plainly. No matter whom we beseech for reinforcements, our envoys will inevitably pass through Gloucester territory. My father is being cautious not to give the Empire a pretext to intervene. Therefore, he is unlikely to allow even envoys to pass through.
Byleth: Why not request reinforcements from the Kingdom?
Claude: Ah... I guess I haven't told you yet, Teach. The Kingdom isn't in a position to be sending anyone reinforcements. After losing King Lambert during the Tragedy of Duscur, a Regent had been handling it's politics. But then... There was a bloody coup. The Regent and Prince Dimitri both... Apparently the whole family was killed. All Blaiddyd territory, including the Kingdom capital, is being ruled by those who are cooperating with the Empire. The Kingdom is no more. It's not called the Faerghus Dukedom. The vast majority of the former Kingdom lords bent a knee to the overwhelming power of the Empire and the Dukedom, and now fall under their jurisdiction.
Claude: Some who formerly held power are continuing to resist, but it would be difficult for them to regain it.
Hilda: Oh, hey! I can think of one person who we can ask for reinforcements. Someone whose territory is really close, and who's on good terms with Claude...
Lysithea: Ah! The Hero of Daphnel, I presume?
Leonie: I've seen her before, and she does seem to be reliable.
Marianne: You're talking about Judith, right? I bet she would lend us a hand...
Byleth: She seems intimidating.
Byleth: She seems strong.
Claude: That's right, you've met her once before, Teach. She's a fearsome one-woman army. She did a lot for me, even before I was recognized as the heir to House Riegan. I don't like the idea of owing her more than I already do, but given the situation, sacrifices must be made. I'll reach out to her. As for the rest of you, prepare for our next battle.

Claude: Heya, Teach. How are you feeling? Does anything feel, um... strange at all?
Byleth: Nothing in particular.
Claude: Good. I still vividly remember you suddenly collapsing and passing out after you went through those changes. But maybe that's not a concern now that you've spent five long years napping.
Byleth: I feel a bit sluggish.
Claude: Well, you were asleep for five whole years, after all. It'll probably take time to get you back to top form. Though I'm relieved to see you haven't lost a step as far as combat goes.
Claude: Your command bringing my schemes to life... That's just how we fight best.
Byleth: Any word from Judith?
Claude: Not yet, but there's no need to worry. That woman adores me. Once we've bolstered our forces, it'll finally be time to start taking decisive action. But I wonder... Do you really think Rhea is still alive?
Byleth: She's alive.
Claude: I think so too. It's hard to imagine the death of someone as important as her staying a secret.
Byleth: I don't know.
Claude: There's no telling. But it's also hard to imagine the death of someone as important as her staying a secret.
Claude: I wonder where she is and what she's doing...
Byleth: Do you hope she's alive?
Claude: All I know is that I still have a lot of questions I need to ask her.
Byleth: Do you hope she's dead? 
Claude: That's a dangerous question, Teach. To be honest, I've given it a lot of thought. All I know is that I still have a lot of questions I need to ask her.
Claude: About the true history of Crest Stones and Heroes' Relics... and the truth behind the legend of Seiros and Nemesis. She has secrets. Too many of them for my comfort. Considering the state of the world... it's suspicious. You must be curious about what was done to you and what her plans were for you, right? And you never did learn about your mother, did you? None of our doubts will ever be clear unless we hear these answers from Rhea herself. In that sense, I absolutely hope Rhea is still alive. But as far as Fódlan goes, I do wonder what a world without Rhea would look like.
Byleth: A world without Rhea?
Claude: The majority of people in Fódlan believe in the Seiros faith that Rhea preaches. That's why they accept the noble system as if it were the only option, and refuse to associate with those who believe in anything else. That closed-minded philosophy is the reason why Fódlan's Throat is locked tight. But if you remove the archbishop who strictly advocates that doctrine, that world view is no longer absolute. There's room for free thought. The leadership of the church would undoubtedly fall to you, and you would hold the power to change the shape of the faith. Of the world. Then, for the first time, people would truly be free to think for themselves. To decide what's right, and what's wrong. Honestly, I believe Edelgard is probably hoping to achieve something very similar. But her methods require too much bloodshed. That's not something the world can get behind. Anyway... The best thing we can do is find Rhea and hear what she has to say. Heh, oops... I guess I've been going on for a while now. Sorry about that. You should get some rest.
