@Opening
Having parted ways with Edelgard, former students of the Black Eagle House now work alongside the Knights of Seiros at Garreg Mach. They begin to create a resistance army strong enough to take on her Imperial forces.

@Dialogue 
Alois: Ah, thank the goddess... I couldn't bear the thought of letting Jeralt down by not finding you.
Shamir: Guess you lucked out.
Catherine: We've been looking everywhere for you! But...I see Lady Rhea isn't with you. Damn.
Cyril: Everyone was real worried about you, Professor.
Hanneman: Seteth has told us everything. From here on out, you will have our aid.
Seteth: I am so grateful that everyone is safe. I am sorry things are moving so rapidly, but there is something we must discuss. Come with me.



Seteth: The time has come to make our true stand against the Empire.
Byleth: Let's win, no matter what.
Byleth: Let's all work together. 
Byleth: I don't feel confident, but we'll do our best.
Seteth: Our base will be Garreg Mach Monastery. The interior is in less than pristine condition, but we should be able to utilize it much the same as we had before.
Catherine: Surely those Imperial jerks have this place staked out, right? It's a highly strategic location.
Seteth: It may be an area of importance, but it is far removed from the front lines. Considering the burden of transport, it is possible they are not paying too much attention to it.
Shamir: Nothing escapes the emperor. There must be at least a spy or two.
Flayn: Professor, what do you think?
Byleth: I have no objections.
Flayn: I see! Then it must be the right idea!
Byleth: I'm worried about supplies.
Seteth: Your concern is valid. However...
Seteth: The town and surrounding hamlets are still present, and though far from abundant, the church still has funds at its disposal.
Flayn: That's true... Professor, I think we can leave expanding our army to my brother. He was always good at negotiating, and I believe he is best suited to the task.
Ferdinand: In that case, I have a request. Please allow my soldiers to join your ranks as well. House Aegir already tried taking on the emperor. As a result, our territory was stolen from us. As a consequence, I do not have many soldiers left to speak of. But those I have are yours to command.
Dorothea: I feel like I should tell you that I've been protecting some kids who lost their parents in the war. They're in the town right now, but maybe we can move them to the monastery? I'm sure they'd be happy to chip in however they can.
Seteth: Hm... Yes, I understand. I will make the necessary arrangements.
Linhardt: I nabbed some valuables from my house. Father is with the emperor now, so... It's not much, but it's yours.
Bernadetta: I don't have a thing to contribute. In fact, I'm still in my same old clothes!
Caspar: I've been wandering on my own for five years. I won't go back to that house or my father, that's for sure!
Seteth: I understand. Leave it to me. No labor is too great if it means saving Fódlan...

@Conversation 
Ferdinand: I have lost my dominion. My nobility may seem like nothing more that a title. But I will never lose my noble heart. I will stop Edelgard, even if it costs me my life. I have turned my blade against her now. I cannot go back on that decision. Professor... Do you think I chose the wrong path?
Byleth: Not at all.
Ferdinand: You are right...
Byleth: We'll find out soon enough. 
Ferdinand: You are right...



Linhardt: The promise was made five years ago, but I must say I'm rather impressed by how many of us managed to make it. Personally, I only showed up because I hoped to see you again, Professor. I've been with my family in the Empire until recently. I admit to feeling a little guilty betraying Her Majesty...but only a little. Now that we're all together again, I suppose the fighting will begin soon.



Caspar: Hey, Professor! You won't believe what happened! I figured I couldn't go back to the Empire after Garreg Mach fell, so I started drifting across the Kingdom and the Alliance. Then I just happened to run into our old class, so we came back to the monastery together!

Bernadetta: Ah, at last, I return to my domain! My lonely paradise! My realm of exquisite solitude! Huh? Professor? Is that, um. Is that you? You, um. You didn't hear that just now, did you?
Byleth: Sorry.
Bernadetta: Oh! Forget you heard anything!
Byleth: Hear what? 
Bernadetta: Right. You didn't? Well, um. Good.



Dorothea: Laaa-la-laaa-la-laaa... Professor! Oh my! It's so good to see you. These days, so many old friends seem to be disappearing. But you... You're here! It's incredible to see you again after five years! I have a feeling your name will go down in history.



Petra: Edelgard is controlling the Empire. She is putting the pressure on the Kingdom and Alliance. Empire and religion are at open war. It will be...difficult for us at first. But corrupt nobles are many. That means that common people will rebel and be joining our side. With you, Professor, the battle tides will...ah, will turn. I have certainty.



Felix: A country with no king has no future. That's why I made my way here. Professor, don't let me down.
Byleth: Country with no king?
Felix: Hmph. You'll understand soon enough.
Byleth: Let's forge ahead. 
Felix: Yes, let's. Find me a worthy opponent to battle, and I'll be content.




Sylvain: I left home without telling my father. Did you know that? I can just imagine my father's face contorted in anger and the delightful words he must have used to describe me. Kind of a scary image, actually. But regardless, I've put my faith in you, Professor. And I'm hoping I haven't made a big mistake.



Sylvain: Hey, Professor. It's been a while. It's really good to see you again. Gorgeous as ever, might I add. An awful lot has happened in these past five years. There were so many times I wished you were around. I'm glad you're back. Your skills are worth more than a whole army.



Mercedes: You're here, Professor, along with everyone from our old class. It's like we've gone back in time! When I think that I'll be around you again, all of my sorrows just drift away.
Byleth: Frankly, I don't feel too happy.
Mercedes: Hmm, I understand. Especially with Lady Rhea missing... It sounds like the Kingdom and Alliance have been in a sorry state too. But we can't let that get us down!
Byleth: Let's do our best together.
Mercedes: Hmm, yes. I'll at least try not to hold anyone back.
Mercedes: Let's work together for the common good, like we did five years ago!



Annette: Members of the knights tell me that Father left their ranks five years ago. They say he announced he was returning to the Kingdom, but nobody's heard from him since. I haven't received word that he went back home to Mother... Where could he be... Where are you, Father...



Ingrid: Professor, I have a proposal. Why not go beyond the Knights of Seiros--instead, uniting with allies from all across Fódlan to fight for our cause? Looking back, it would have been best to ally with the Kingdom and join forces against the Empire. But now the Kingdom is not exactly... Well...



Raphael: Fighting alongside you and everyone else is a dream come true, Professor! And don't worry about my little sis. Right now she's back home helping out with the family business. I kinda figured I was gonna be stuck going back and taking over for her. But thanks to you guys, I get to work on my dream of becoming a proper knight!



Ignatz: It's been fixed up quite a bit, but its battle scars aren't so easily erased... To think that a glorious cathedral, with a thousand year history...would end up like this. I'll rebuild this place someday. This cathedral is the symbol of Fódlan. Maybe I should paint a picture of the beautiful cathedral of old, while I still remember what it looked like...



Lysithea: I've grown weary and impatient--these past five years, my hands have been bound. But now, I can finally take action with a clear goal. I'm grateful to you and to everyone.
Byleth: I didn't do anything. 
Lysithea: Nonsense. Your presence steeled everyone's resolve.
Byleth: And that goal is?
Lysithea: Down with the Empire! Surely peace will soon follow if the Empire is overthrown. Then my parents can finally find peace themselves.



Marianne: Even with the church in shambles, we can still pray. The goddess will surely hear our prayers, but still... I hope the church can return to its former beauty someday.



Hilda: Hey, Professor? I know that we didn't plan to stop at the monastery, but I'm glad we did. I'm happy to be here with everyone again.
Byleth: You're happy at a time like this?
Hilda: What good does grimness do us? Let's try to enjoy our time together while we still can.
Byleth: I'm happy too. 
Hilda: Right? It's as though we went back in time five years. I feel like my old self again.



Leonie: It's not just for my village that I'm fighting alongside you here, you know. It's also that Captain Jeralt asked me, his first and greatest apprentice, to look out for you. Of course, it wouldn't be enough just to keep you alive. It's my duty to make sure you win too. So, do your best, Professor. And count on me to watch your back.



Seteth: With the return of its knights, Garreg Mach is finally coming back to life. The Church of Seiros will follow you from now on, but please do not abandon the search for Lady Rhea.
Byleth: We'll do whatever it takes to find her. 
Seteth: Thank you. I know the battles ahead will be dire, but we will support you with all our strength.
Byleth: We don't know what the future will bring.
Seteth: Wherever she is, Rhea is doubtlessly waiting for you. Please do not let her down.



Flayn: Professor, I am so glad you are unharmed! No matter the path you walk, I will be with you every step of the way. Anything you ask of me, I shall see it through. You saved my life, and I am in your debt.



Hanneman: Thankfully, it appears the records and equipment I need for my research have not been damaged. I am most curious though. You say you were asleep for five whole years? Incredible. Perhaps this is another effect of your Crest. I do look forward to investigating you in greater detail.
Byleth: We can talk about that. 
Hanneman: Wonderful news! I am most excited to begin. We must find the time, of course.
Byleth: Uh, maybe later...
Hanneman: I'll have to be content with observing you wherever you go, then. I cannot waste any opportunity!



Manuela: My, Professor. You haven't changed a bit! At your age, I'd expect your while demeanor to have changed greatly over five years... Though, I suppose I haven't changed either right? Thank you for noticing, by the way. Ah, just the two of us, forever young. Oh, let me have my fun.



Alois: I'd given up on ever seeing you again. Where have you been hiding? Anyway, now that we're reunited in the land of the living, I must fulfill my promise!
Byleth: What promise?
Alois: The promise I made to the captain, to keep you safe! I can't believe you've forgotten. How cold...
Byleth: Right, the promise. 
Alois: That's right! I promised the captain I'd protect you in his stead, and now I'll make good on my word!



Catherine: In Lady Rhea's absence, I will follow you. That's what she would want me to do. Know that wherever you might lead us, I'll continue searching for Lady Rhea.
Byleth: That's fine. 
Catherine: Good, because I will not budge on that point. Welcome back, Professor.
Byleth: Sounds like a lot of trouble.
Catherine: I don't care how much trouble it is! I will rescue Lady Rhea, at all costs.



Shamir: I'm more of a mercenary than a knight these days. I work to get paid. I never was too attached to Fódlan. I was considering leaving soon... But I might change my mind if you're around.



Cyril: I don't know anything about rebuilding, but I can sure do my best to clean up the mess. I'm gonna keep Lady Rhea's room spotless, so she can use it right away whenever she gets back. You gotta find her, Professor. You just gotta.



Anna: There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals.

Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! You know, it's such a thrill to be able to greet you like this again! I almost died in the battle five years ago, but I won't allow any enemies to get into this place again. I promise you that! even if the Death Knight shows up, I'll be sure to... Well, for now I'll keep training so I can eventually feel confident that I can stop him!

@Intro 
Seteth: Your attention, everyone. The Knights of Seiros and our most trusted allies have gathered. We have rallied our troops for the purpose of stopping the Adrestian Empire's efforts to rule all. We have prepared a new flag to fight under...
Seteth: Much like the professor, it bears the Crest of Flames. I hope everyone finds this suitable. Beneath this flag, we will bring back peace to the great land of Fódlan!


Flayn: Professor, I'm not sure I understand... Why is the Empire intent on making an enemy of the church?
Byleth: I don't understand either.
Flayn: Quite perplexing... If the church disappears from Fódlan, I wonder if the Empire thinks it will benefit them in some way? I feel, I feel that it will only confuse the people.
Byleth: They must oppose the way of the church.
Flayn: What is meant by the way of the church? What do they dislike about it?
Seteth: I have no idea what Edelgard was thinking or how she arrived at the decision to raise an army. However, I do have some small insight as to what she is after. She is attempting to destroy the existing social order. That is why the Church of Seiros is first on the list of institutions that must be destroyed. It may very well be her goal to rebuild Fódlan from the ground up...
Flayn: I see... But that is only Edelgard's desire, is it not? I cannot imagine that the people of Fódlan would want that for themselves. She may have high ideals, but she certainly lacks any compunction about throwing the world, and its people, into an awful war... It just seems so illogical!
Seteth: You have a point, Flayn. I do not believe the people will ever understand her aim. So long as she makes the people suffer, our Knights of Seiros will fight on and strive to protect them. If we do not defeat Edelgard and retake control of this world, Fódlan's future shall be as dark as night.
Flayn: Thank you, dear Brother. I finally feel I understand what is going on.
Seteth: I am always happy to answer your questions, Flayn. Is there anything else you wish to ask?
Flayn: Well, um... Actually, I have a question for the professor. My brother mentioned that...you slumbered for five years. Where was it that you slept?
Byleth: At the bottom of a valley.
Flayn: The bottom of a valley? In the water? That certainly sounds frigid! I would never choose such a place myself. I am surprised you did not fall ill.
Byleth: Under a rock.
Flayn: Under a rock... How similar we are! As it were, I took my rest in a casket made of stone.

Flayn: Oh. Well, I suppose one's first long slumber is difficult to recall...
Byleth: ...
Knight of Seiros: Pardon the intrusion, but we must prepare a counterattack! Now! It seems the Imperial Army found out about us entering the monastery!
Seteth: Hm. That is sooner than expected. They must have been spying on us...
Flayn: I wonder if we can win on our own...
Knight of Seiros: There aren't many of them... It looks like we'll just be facing the ones who were stationed nearby.
Seteth: Did they move on us too soon? Perhaps if we fight by using the land to our advantage...
Byleth: Let's proceed carefully.
Seteth: Of course. If we are careful, we will not lose.
Byleth: Let's destroy them.
Flayn: Yes, I agree. Let us take them out in one fell swoop!
Seteth: Never again will those Imperial scoundrels disgrace Garreg Mach with their presence! Onward, Professor!

@Opening 
Though preparations are still being made to raise troops for the resistance army at Garreg Mach, the Imperial army is already one step ahead. Anticipating the resistance army's actions, General Randolph and the Imperial vanguard under his command begin their advance towards Garreg Mach to reclaim the monastery.

Fulfilling a promise made five years ago, your former students gather once more at the monastery, as do the knights. However, your joyful reunion is cut short...

@Battle 
Randolph: The Knights of Seiros are a powerful enemy, but we have more soldiers. We'll take them down all at once!
Seteth: Clever tactics are our only hope here. We will use fire to deal with the main enemy force.

Knight of Seiros: Report! The enemy has entered the periphery of Garreg Mach!
Seteth: If we allow them to take the interior, the monastery will be lost. We must drive them back!

Imperial Soldier: What? That strange battle flag is... But isn't our enemy the Church of Seiros?
Randolph: They didn't have enough soldiers with just the church, so they upped their numbers by joining with those filthy rogues. It doesn't matter what flag they fly. They're nothing more than a mob. We'll destroy them all!

Seteth: Our troops are preparing the attack. Protect them until they reach their destination!

Seteth: Ugh... To think we'd let Garreg Mach fall twice to these rebels...

Randolph: A total loss... But we can't just return home like this...
Seteth: Watch out, Professor! They're coming for you!


Seteth: Our fire unit was destroyed. The plan has failed...
Randolph: It looks like they were planning something, but it failed!

Seteth: All is prepared. Now we just need to draw the enemy's attention. Traitors! Repent of your sins and the goddess may yet show you mercy!
Randolph: Quiet! Don't think you'll get away with mocking me! Attack! Make sure they never speak again!
Seteth: Now! Begin!

Imperial Soldier 1: Fire! Gyaaaaaah!
Imperial Soldier 2: It burns! Save me!
Randolph: Argh, a fire attack... The damage is too great. We can't fight anymore! All units, retreat! I'll take on our pursuers! Carry away the injured soldiers!


Seteth: Press the attack! Give them no quarter!

@End 
Seteth: We drove back the Imperial army. The real fight has only just begun...
Caspar: I never thought I'd be fighting Randolph... I guess it can't be helped, seeing as how I've left my own territory and all. But...what will I do if my father or brother get involved. I really don't want to face them...
Byleth: We must stay strong.
Ferdinand: Too true, Professor. So long as the Empire is our enemy, we cannot avoid fighting those we are acquainted with. Though I suppose I have it easier since my house is no longer on the Empire's side.
Dorothea: My friends from the opera said they would leave the capital and go west... So, at least I won't be seeing them in battle.
Linhardt: Hmm, I don't think I care if my own house falls. Let's make it a grand fight...after a grand nap of course...
Petra: It does not give me happiness to have the people of Brigid involved...but it is not the time to be thinking of that. If it is a possibility, I will be having their strength.
Bernadetta: I don't mind at all. Really! I have no friends anyway, and my father hasn't done much to make me care for him. Not that he'd ever step on a battlefield anyway! Oh, but I do wonder how Mother is doing...
Seteth: Each of our situations is unique. What we share is companionship and the will to fight as one. Professor, you are the heart of our efforts. We will support you as best we can.

Seteth: I have a proposal. It would be most difficult to fight the Imperial army with the forces we have now. As such, I believe we should send messengers to whatever lords we can trust in the Kingdom and the Alliance so that we may gain their support. Do you agree?
Byleth: I agree. 
Seteth: It is heartening to hear you say that.
Byleth: It concerns me.
Seteth: It is difficult to know who we can trust, of course. But we cannot just stand idle either.
Seteth: If all we do is bide our time, out enemy's main army will come down upon us like a hammer from above.
Shamir: Who are you planning to ask?
Catherine: Sadly, House Charon is out. We can trust them, but they have no help to offer.
Alois: Hm, how about House Daphnel of the Alliance? Their leader is sure to at least respond.
Flayn: Oh, how about House Daphnel of the Alliance? I recall that their leader was quite exceptional.
Seteth: Judith, the Hero of Daphnel... Yes, that is a fine suggestion. That territory is on the border of the Kingdom and the Alliance. It has not yet been claimed by the fires of war. If they agree to lend us their troops, out forces will be greatly strengthened. We shall send along a secret messenger at once.
