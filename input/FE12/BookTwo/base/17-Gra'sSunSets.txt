Kris: Sire, I have a report. Our enemy is a mixed army of soldiers from Archanea and Gra... But it seems Gra's soldiers have no will to fight, and are simply being coerced by Archanea's men.
Marth: Then, if we defeat the Archanean soldiers, we might not need to battle those from Gra... I want to avoid pointless sacrifices as much as possible. Kris, convey that to everyone.
Kris: Understood, sire.

Jagen: We have reclaimed our homeland Altea, and we're now going to have a decisive battle against Archanea, our enemy. We will head to the palace, the hub of Archanea, to defeat Gharnef, who kidnapped Princess Elice, and to liberate Emperor Hardin from the Darksphere's control. According to Lord Gotoh, Gharnef is gathering high class clerics, Princess Elice among them... His objectives are unknown, but we must free them quickly. However, to reach the palace, we have to pass through the Kingdom of Gra, now Archanea's pawn...
