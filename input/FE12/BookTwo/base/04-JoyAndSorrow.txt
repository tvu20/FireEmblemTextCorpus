Kris: Sir Jagen, I have returned with the scouts. These are the details.
Jagen: Hmm. We have to rescue Sir Ogma's group as soon as possible... What's this? Who is the Paladin right beside Sir Ogma?
Kris: The details are unclear. The scouts say he's a masked man of unknown identity.
Jagen: Hm... But if he's a Paladin, I doubt he's conspiring with those bandits. Depending on how we talk to him, he might even become our ally.

Jagen: We have quelled the rebellion in Macedon. However, Princess Minerva, thought to be in the rebels' grasp, is elsewhere... If only we had met the princess, we might have been able to avoid confronting Lang like that... I myself have no regrets. The question is how he's going to react. I just hope he won't do anything bad... According to Lang, Sir Ogma took the prince and princess of Grust and is going to meet Lord Wendell. We, too, came here to join Sir Ogma, but this is pirate territory. We must proceed carefully.
