Marth: Kris, about the free company defending Chiasmir bridge northwest...
Kris: Yes, sire?
Marth: I'd like you to leave them alone. Their leader is Astram, hero of Archanea. He wields the sword Mercurius, one of three regalia, and is one of the strongest men in the continent.
Kris: A powerful opponent, I see.
Marth: That isn't the only reason why I don't wish to fight him. In the previous war, Astram was our ally. He's a very serious and loyal person--his devotion to Princess Nyna unmatched.
Astram: ...Forgive my lack of courtesy, but you and I need to be clear on a certain point. While I have decided to lend you my sword, my allegiance lies with Princess Nyna--not you, my lord. I will follow your orders, but should I learn you have been false to her, or that you are manipulating her... Heads will roll.
Marth: I do not think we can persuade him. At least, not now... I'd rather not fight him unless necessary. Kris, I'd like you to avoid battle with him as well, if possible.
Kris: Yes, understood. However, should your life be in danger, sire... I'll do anything to protect you.

Jagen: By our hands, Grust has been liberated, and we are en route to our homeland... But first, we stop by the Fane of Raman... I believe you've already heard, but this was a request by Lord Wendell, who was held captive by the Archanean army. It's said that if even one of the five orbs were to be lost the world would fall into ruin, and now the Starsphere has shattered into twelve pieces... Prince Marth is going to help gather them. I just wish the Fane of Raman has what we desire...
