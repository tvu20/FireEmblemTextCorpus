Jagen: Sire, I bring news. According to an inhabitant of a nearby village... A young dracoknight, badly wounded and on the verge of death, has taken refuge there...
Marth: A dracoknight? I wonder who it is?
Jagen: I don't know who. But... the knight reportedly suffered a deep wound that would've killed any ordinary man... And, as if talking in delirium, was apparently calling your name, sire...
Marth: Make route for the village at once! I want to ascertain the knight's identity. I must meet with them...

Jagen: Emperor Hardin of Archanea has fallen. The long war is now over. However, the kidnapped clerics were illusions created by Gharnef... We still don't know their true whereabouts. But Lord Gotoh has indicated where we should head--The Dragon's Altar, where the earth dragons slumber. As you've no doubt heard, we must banish the earth dragons. If the countless earth dragons awaken, we will witness hell on earth... Fortunately, the Darksphere completed the Binding Shield, so Prince Marth will without doubt seal those earth dragons. Gharnef should be in the Dragon's Altar, and with him the kidnapped clerics. We must head to the Dragon's Altar.
