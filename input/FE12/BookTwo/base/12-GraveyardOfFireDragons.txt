Jagen: Kris, this is the inhospitable region known as Anri's Way. You must take great caution. If you fall, so does our army. So, for Prince Marth's sake as well, you must survive.
Kris: Yes sir. I understand. By the way, Sir Jagen, why exactly is it called Anri's Way?
Jagen: Oh yes. It's a long story, but I'll tell you the legend of Anri. A century ago... The Holy Kingdom of Archanea, governor of this continent, was ravaged by the dragonkin. The people back then lived days of misery, as the dragons' slaves. House Archanea, the people's only hope, was eradicated, and the world descended into despair.
Kris: ...
Jagen: But, at the time, there were rumors of an Archanean princess hiding out in Altea, which back then was no more than a provincial town among many. The furious Dolhrian Empire sent troops to Altea, demanding the princess's extradition.

Such violence...

Kris:
Oh heavens above...
Jagen: That princess--Artemis--planned to sacrifice her own life in order to save the citizens. However, the people of Altea protected her, and vowed to fight, knowing they would be massacred. ...Well, let's stop there for today. We still have a long road ahead of us...

Jagen: Anri's Way is long and hard, but we must reach the Ice Dragon Shrine in order to obtain the Lightsphere. The Lightsphere is an absolute necessity if we wish to negate Hardin's Darksphere... If we obtain it, the day of Altea's liberation comes ever closer as well. Xane, whom you've just met, seems to be oddly knowledgeable about Anri's Way... A welcome companion on this harsh path.
