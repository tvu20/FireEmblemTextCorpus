%Gray 
Gray: Hey, Tobe. How goes?
Tobin: *sigh* It goes, I guess.
Gray: Uh, do you think you could sound a little less cheerful?
Tobin: I don't know, you tell me. Why did you have to—
Gray: Huh?
Tobin: Ugh, never mind. Forget it.
Gray: Wait, what did I do?

Gray: So, uh, Tobin? Are we gonna clear the air here or what?
Tobin: Yeah, I suppose. So is it just me, or are you and Clair getting... close?
Gray: Huh? You think? I feel like she spends all her time telling me to bug off.
Tobin: Yeah, but that's just it. She's comfortable around you, or else she'd never let her hair down like that.
Gray: Heh heh. That's a weird way of reading into things. Why can't you put that much thought into anything else?
Tobin: Oh, you're looking for a fight? Let's take it outside, clown!
Gray: We're already outside. And I'm kind of busy fighting these other guys...
Tobin: Ha ha ha!
Gray: Ha ha ha! Come on already. Let's take out your aggression on someone who deserves it.

Gray: Hey, Tobe. Got a minute?
Tobin: What's wrong?
Gray: Well, I was wondering something. So if Clair fell for someone else—like Alm, or... oh, I dunno, ME—what would you do?
Tobin: What COULD I do? I'd be hurt, but she's a lady of noble birth and I'm just... you know. Tobin. Guys like me are lucky if women like that even show up in our dreams.
Gray: Heh. That's a good attitude.
Tobin: Hey, the writing is on the wall. She's out of my league. But I don't have to throw away the good things I DO have over her. You know, like my best friend?
Gray: I wouldn't want to lose my best pal either.
Tobin: Good. What do you say we make it through today and figure things out from there?
Gray: It's a date! Er, or a plan. Whatever. ...Let's do what you just said.

%Kliff 
Tobin: Hey, look who's here!
Kliff: What do you want, Tobin? Don't talk to me unless you need something.
Tobin: Wow! What crawled up your armor? You know, you've been testier than usual lately. Did I do something wrong?
Kliff: Nope. You're imagining it. Now how about we get back to fighting and forget all this small talk?
Tobin: What? ...Hey! Come on, Kliff, would you just... *sigh*

Tobin: Hey, Kliff. What's new?
Kliff: Are you kidding? I thought I told you—
Tobin: Yeah, yeah. No small talk. Guess I forgot.
Kliff: Or else you're doing it on purpose to get under my skin.
Tobin: Heh heh.
Kliff: I really can't stand when you do that.
Tobin: Yeesh. Do you want to talk about it? Maybe need a hug?

Kliff: Tobin.
Tobin: By the Mother! Did you actually just start a conversation?
Kliff: You were going to approach me anyway. ...Don't ask me why. I thought treating you like dirt would have inspired you to give me space.
Tobin: Aw, you don't treat me like dirt! Look, you like to vent, I get it.
Kliff: How can you be so NICE? I try to be nice, but other people just make me crazy. And when you let me take it out on you, I feel even worse.
Tobin: So what? That's normal. You're my friend—I don't care if you give me guff once in a while.
Kliff: Really?
Tobin: Sure! Plus I'm not so nice—there are lots of things that tick me off. I just choose to let 'em slide. ...Except maybe when Alm or Gray show me up. I can't stand that.
Kliff: Well, they ARE much better at fighting than you.
Tobin: Hey!
Kliff: Heh. Sorry. Couldn't resist.
