Celica: Hello, Atlas.
Atlas: Lady Celica!
Celica: I hope you're feeling well. I often worry that you push yourself too hard.
Atlas: Heh heh! Aw, a little scratch like this ain't nothing to worry about. Heck, I do this kinda thing to unwind!
Celica: You talk like it's a tavern brawl! Though I wager the general idea's the same.
Atlas: More or less, yeah. So you can keep the orders coming! You saved my life, remember? Gotta do what I can to pay you back.
Celica: I see. Well, thank you, Atlas. Just please be careful, okay?

Atlas: ......
Celica: What's wrong, Atlas? We're in combat, yet you seem distracted.
Atlas: Sorry, Lady Celica. I was just thinking of my little brothers and got a mite distracted. I hope they're doing all right.
Celica: I hope so, too. You must miss them most terribly.
Atlas: Yeah, but some things just have to wait. Right now, we need to focus on cleaning this place up!
Celica: ......

Celica: Atlas, I've been thinking...
Atlas: Oh! Um, yeah? I mean...what about?
Celica: Well, I know you miss your younger brothers a great deal... So I thought, maybe it would help to think of me as your younger sister.
Atlas: Um... sorry?
Celica: I know brothers and sisters aren't quite the same, especially as we aren't blood, but, well, I thought it might help regardless.
Atlas: Well, gosh. That's awfully nice, but it's a bit more than "not quite" the same. I mean, you're about a million times too proper to pass for one'a my brothers...
Celica: Ah. I see. In that case, I apologize. It's just that I see you giving your all for my sake, so... well, I was merely hoping there might be something I could do for you.
Atlas: That's a swell thought, Lady Celica. But just the thought's more than enough for me. I knew you were kind, but you're also pretty dang interesting to boot! Makes me that much happier I signed on with you.
Celica: I-is that so? Well, I'm glad to hear it. At least... I think I'm glad?
