%Mae 
Mae: Hey, Celica! How's tricks?
Celica: Hello, Mae. I'm managing well enough, I imagine.
Mae: Great! Oh, but if you DO wanna start slacking, you just leave things to me.
Celica: Hee hee. You're always so full of energy, Mae.
Mae: Yup! That's pretty much my one selling point. ...Well, that and zappin' fools. Now get ready, because I'm gonna help the heck outta you today!

Mae: *sigh* ...
Celica: What's wrong, Mae? It's not like you to sigh so... aggressively. Is there some way I can help?
Mae: Oh, it's nothing important. It's just... well, I was wondering—Do you think girls should be all delicate and proper and junk?
Celica: Er, well, I suppose I think there's room for every girl to be herself.
Mae: Wait, you mean it?! Aw, but you're super nice, so of course you'd say that. You don't count!
Celica: I don't... count? Oh, enough of this, Mae. What's your REAL problem?
Mae: What?! Uhh... Okay, so here's the thing... Hypothetically—just hypothetically—let's say there was someone I liked. Someone I'd always been close to, but who never saw me as a woman. I mean, in that case, I'D have to be the problem, right?
Celica: I don't... Oh. Oooooooh. I don't think you need to worry, Mae. You're a wonderful woman. You're kind and cheerful, and you always encourage your friends to keep going. You're an absolute catch just the way you are. Have confidence in yourself!
Mae: Aw, geez... I'm blushing! ... I mean, hypothetically! We're still just talking hypothetically, right?
Celica: Er, yes. Yes, of course.
Mae: Tee hee! Hey, thanks, though. Really.

Mae: Hey, Celica! Hold up!
Celica: Oh! Hello, Mae. You seem to be back in your usual high spirits.
Mae: You know it! I decided that being myself was the most important thing after all.
Celica: I think that's very wise. Besides, it made me sad to see you down.
Mae: Hey, but thanks again. You know? For what you said? I was really happy to hear how you felt about me. You gave me the butt-kick of confidence that I needed!
Celica: Goodness! Well, I only shared the truth with you. I'm proud to call you my friend, Mae, and I hope to do so for a long time.
Mae: Of course, silly! We'll be besties forever! Now get ready to get the heck helped out of you yet AGAIN!

%Atlas 
Celica: Hello, Atlas.
Atlas: Lady Celica!
Celica: I hope you're feeling well. I often worry that you push yourself too hard.
Atlas: Heh heh! Aw, a little scratch like this ain't nothing to worry about. Heck, I do this kinda thing to unwind!
Celica: You talk like it's a tavern brawl! Though I wager the general idea's the same.
Atlas: More or less, yeah. So you can keep the orders coming! You saved my life, remember? Gotta do what I can to pay you back.
Celica: I see. Well, thank you, Atlas. Just please be careful, okay?

Atlas: ......
Celica: What's wrong, Atlas? We're in combat, yet you seem distracted.
Atlas: Sorry, Lady Celica. I was just thinking of my little brothers and got a mite distracted. I hope they're doing all right.
Celica: I hope so, too. You must miss them most terribly.
Atlas: Yeah, but some things just have to wait. Right now, we need to focus on cleaning this place up!
Celica: ......

Celica: Atlas, I've been thinking...
Atlas: Oh! Um, yeah? I mean...what about?
Celica: Well, I know you miss your younger brothers a great deal... So I thought, maybe it would help to think of me as your younger sister.
Atlas: Um... sorry?
Celica: I know brothers and sisters aren't quite the same, especially as we aren't blood, but, well, I thought it might help regardless.
Atlas: Well, gosh. That's awfully nice, but it's a bit more than "not quite" the same. I mean, you're about a million times too proper to pass for one'a my brothers...
Celica: Ah. I see. In that case, I apologize. It's just that I see you giving your all for my sake, so... well, I was merely hoping there might be something I could do for you.
Atlas: That's a swell thought, Lady Celica. But just the thought's more than enough for me. I knew you were kind, but you're also pretty dang interesting to boot! Makes me that much happier I signed on with you.
Celica: I-is that so? Well, I'm glad to hear it. At least... I think I'm glad?

%Nomah 
Celica: How are you feeling, Nomah?
Nomah: I'm getting by well enough, little one.
Celica: That's good. But please promise me that you won't overexert yourself.
Nomah: Bah! Stop treating me like a frail old man with one foot in the grave! ...Though I admit all this fighting DOES take a toll on my poor back.
Celica: I'm very sorry to hear it. Let me rub it for you.
Nomah: Oh... Yes, that feels wonderful... Thank you, little one.
Celica: Happy to help! Hee hee.

Celica: How's your back today, Nomah?
Nomah: Lithe as a willow branch, thanks to you. But now my shoulder is giving me trouble. Old jousting injury, you see...
Celica: Oh, you poor thing. Here, let me give you another massage.
Nomah: Oh! Oh... Ahh... You're too kind. Ahh... I can feel the pain receding already.
Celica: I'm very glad to hear it.

Celica: Hello, Nomah.
Nomah: Greetings, little one. Oh! Yes. Er, so today, it seems I have a new pain in my... um... hair? Yes, that's—
Celica: *sigh* Stop, Nomah. You don't need to keep pretending. In truth, I don't think you've been in pain this whole time.
Nomah: Heh heh. Caught on to me, have you?
Celica: You've always enjoyed your little jokes and japes. At this rate, you're well enough to keep fighting for me for a long while yet. Uh oh. Here comes the enemy now. Let's go!
Nomah: Ah! Yes. More... fighting. All right, Nomah, time to suck it up!

%Conrad 
Celica: Oh! Hello, Conrad.
Masked Knight: Anthiese? Is that you, Sister?
Celica: Well, yes, of course, but... Hee hee...
Conrad: Huh? What's so funny?
Celica: S-sorry, it's just... I know in my head it's you, but you just look so INTENSE with that mask on! It's like I have two different brothers.
Conrad: Aw, whaaat? C'mon! I'm the only brother you need!
Celica: Hee hee. Yes, you're right. One is MORE than enough.

Conrad: Anthiese! Everything all right?
Celica: Er, Conrad? What happened to your mask?
Conrad: I decided to stop wearing it when you're around. I mean, how could I keep it on after what you said last time?
Celica: Aww... I was only teasing, Conrad. Please don't take it to heart.
Conrad: Even if you didn't mean it seriously, it's serious to me.
Celica: Oh, come on, Brother, don't be like that!

Conrad: Anthiese!
Celica: Oh! I didn't know you were so close by.
Conrad: Heh heh. Kinda funny how we keep running into each other like this, huh?
Celica: This is hardly the time for idle chit-chat, Conrad. Everyone else is fighting their hardest, and we need to do the same. Why can't you be as sharp and dashing as when you were the masked knight?
Conrad: Wait, dashing? Daaaashing? Er, one second!
Masked Knight: Any who dare lay a hand on my sister shall feel the sting of my blade!
Celica: Hee hee! Yes! THAT'S the spirit!
