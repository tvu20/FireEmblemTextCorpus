Kliff: So now we’re at war with Rigel. I meant to see the world, and now it seems I’m REALLY seeing it. Heh. I make it sound so grand, but honestly, I’ve just been running. I hated it in the village. My mother never thought of anyone but herself. I couldn’t spend my life there. So now I’ve found all the excitement I longed for, plus a fair lot I didn’t! But don’t tell the others I’m actually enjoying this. Heh heh.

Faye: It’s so cold in the Rigelian Empire— nothing at all like Zofia. When we first left Ram, I never dreamed we would come so far. I hope Ma and Pa and Nana are doing all right without me… I send them letters, you know? Just the other day, I got one back. They said I talk too much about you. They want to know what’s happening with me, not you. But they don’t understand that I AM writing about myself! Or at least I’m writing about what matters to me…

Clair: Gray told me everything, Alm. So you and that Celica woman were friends when you were little? That’s why you seemed so close! Good, then. I was starting to worry. Well, not WORRY. I mean, it’s not my business how you two… Oh, never mind. But are you certain Celica is just a priestess? The way she carried herself was more… refined. Like how you carry yourself.

Gray: Welp, we’re finally on imperial soil. Pretty nice dirt, if I’m being honest. And here I thought I would just waste away in little old Ram Village. That’s what my pa, my pa’s pa, and his pa before him did. It’s a shame commoners’ lives have to be so damned common. …Huh? You think it’ll change? …You think WE can change it? Well, it’d be nice if commoners had the same shot at knighthood as nobles. Heck, if we build that world, maybe the folks I’ve had to kill can forgive me… Or maybe not. Heh.

Tobin: Alm, I’m gonna level with you… I’ve always hated how you were better than me at everything. Gray told me I should stop trying to compete with you, but damn it… I just couldn’t see how we were in such different places. But I understand it now. You’re meant to lead, and you have the strength and ability to back it up. My job isn’t to be better than you— it’s to be part of your strength. I’m not going to say I like it…but I can definitely accept it. So I just want you to know that I’ll always be there for you.

Silque: You may recall me mentioning the pilgrimage my mother and I went on. Well, as it turns out, the pilgrimage was in Rigel. This is because my Mother was a cleric of the Duma Faithful. It was only later that she crossed to Zofia and left me with the priory. It was sudden, and I never learned why. She simply vanished from my life. But another mother rescued me when I was at my lowest—the Mother Mila. Now I will spend my life repaying that debt however I can. I will bring the Mother’s wisdom to the meek and lonely and save them in turn.

Python: Tired yet, chief? Now we’re taking on Rigel? …You work oddly hard for someone your age. Still, defeat the emperor, and the empire will be yours, yeah? Well, better you than me. I don’t want to be responsible for anyone but yours truly. Uh oh. You look like you’re gonna ask a tough question. Okay, I’m listening. …Yeah, I guess I’d lead the damn country if I had to. I just don’t WANT to have to. I’m diligent, not masochistic. Look, put it this way—I know my limits, and I respect ’em. Heh. Wouldn’t want to disappoint anyone, right?

Luthier: Oh, Alm. Do you need something? …No? Then why did you speak to me? …Because you felt like it? Ah, I see. Friendship demands a certain amount of perfunctory conversation. Forgive me. I have little experience with friendship. And, um, no friends. There were others my age in the village, but we were never close. I suppose I never felt the need to get to know them. However, I had a most excellent relationship with one of the cats. …Yes, I know that doesn’t count. You needn’t remind me. But if you insist, YOU can be my first human friend, Alm. Congratulations.

Luthier: Delthea and I descend from a mage disciple of the champion Zofia. This disciple was female, so her gifts pass more readily to female heirs. Magical ability is in the blood. If one is not born with it… Well, they will never hear the spirits’ voices, no matter how hard they train. I know how precious my gifts are, so I intend to spend my life perfecting them. I understand my calling, even if Delthea does not.

Mathilda: Alm, do you have any brothers or sisters? My little sisters back home have been writing me and clamoring for my return. I’ve started to wonder if all siblings are like that. Stranger yet, they’re fully grown! You’d think they could get by without me. But when you consider how fond Clair is of Clive… Well, perhaps children just naturally look up to elder brothers and sisters. …Hmm? How many sisters do I have? Four, actually. I love them, but they can be quite trying sometimes. For they tend to chatter like harpies whenever they want attention…

Mathilda: Clive and I became close after enlisting in the Knights of Zofia. Our houses had cordial relations before that, but Clair wouldn’t let me near her elder brother. On the battlefield, Clive was like some mythological hero. From the moment I saw him, I knew my heart was his. And for all his toughness, when the two of us are alone, he can be quite… Well, that is none of your concern.

Delthea: Things are what you might call “delicate” in our village. We’re not supposed to talk about the whole “magical bloodline” thing. That’s bullplop, though, right? I think it is. We’ve got all this incredible magic at our disposal, and we have to HIDE it? I wanna show off! I want people to bask in my awesomeness! Plus, who wants to do REAL work? Uh, I mean… Anyway! I’m glad I fight for you now and do what I’m good at. Feel free to lay on the compliments when you see me kickin’ tail, yeah?

Delthea: You know, folks tell me I’m wasting my natural talents. Well, I never asked to be amazing! I’m not even all that interested in magic or fighting. My brother’s the one who’s all gung-ho about it. Don’t get me wrong! I’m glad that I have a way of helping you all out, but I sure hope that doesn’t end up being my purpose in life, because… Anyway, hurry up and bring this war to an end, would you, Alm? I wanna do what I feel like without folks giving me guff all the time.

Tatiana: I was raised in an orphanage in one of Rigel’s villages. But I wasn’t a sad child. Far from it, in fact. I always had lots of friends, and the clerics were very kind. That’s what inspired me to become a cleric myself. I want to help people the way they helped me. …Oh, you think I’ve succeeded? Well, that’s nice of you! I wonder. I’m quite the scatterbrain, if you hadn’t noticed. Why, just the other day, I had to bake bread for the church’s hungry. But I forgot it was in the oven, and the loaf came out like a stone! Of course, everyone laughed and ate it anyway. Probably broke their teeth… Sometimes I think they give me more support than the other way around.

Tatiana: When I found Zeke on the beach and saw his wounds, I thought him done for. But I cared for him anyway because I wanted him to live. When he finally opened his eyes, I was filled with elation. I kept caring for him, and eventually we started taking walks together. Then I realized how happy I was spending time with him, and fell in love. Zeke calls himself half a man because of the past he’s lost. But that half is all I will ever need.

Tatiana: …Oh. Alm. Can I help you? …I seem down? Yes, well I suppose I HAVE been ruminating a bit. It’s just…what if Zeke’s memory somehow comes back? What if he remembers he has another family or…another lover? Of course, it would only be right if he returned to her in such a case. But I must be a selfish, awful person, because I don’t want him to remember. What the gods must think of a sinful servant like me…

Zeke: …Ah, Alm. It seems we will reach Rigel Castle soon. On that day, I will have to aid you in striking down Emperor Rudolf. I know it to be his wish, yet still I wonder if that makes us in the right. The emperor was convinced you would be the one to save Valentia. I confess I still do not fully understand what he meant by that… but I believe in you, Alm. Know that, if nothing else.

Zeke: I was badly injured when I washed up on Valentia’s shores from some other land. Tatiana was the one who found me and took me in. She tended to my wounded body and comforted my broken spirit. It baffled me how one might go so far to aid a complete stranger. But I would not be alive if not for it. She is the reason I still exist at all. So I forgive her for occasionally rubbing sea salt in my wounds instead of salve…

Zeke: …Where am I from? Alas, I know not. Though what use is wondering? Some have speculated I’m from another continent called Archanea. But as I have said, I prefer to let the past be in the past. If I think on it overlong, my heart begins to ache. I fear whatever I left behind could not have been pleasant. Save for one memory… Apologies. I must let it rest. I have Tatiana’s feelings to consider.

Atlas: You saw for yourself—my village is crammed full of a whole lot of nothing. I love it, though. All I need is a good axe, healthy trees, and some sunshine. My parents were the same way. I feel like I inherited the mountain from them. But once I started fighting and won a couple of battles, things changed. Everybody pushed me to go to war so I could get rich and famous. And sure, I want to provide a decent life for my little brothers… But my leaving home has made life harder for them, not easier. I tell ya, dreams of striking it rich can be expensive things. Soon as we’re done, I’m gettin’ back to the mountain and back to cuttin’ wood!

Conrad: Greetings, Anthiese! You’re looking lovely today as usual. Hah! No need to be bashful—I merely speak the truth. Growing up at the villa, you always were my favorite sibling. Small wonder, what with my mother being Rigelian. The other siblings and their mothers always kept me at arm’s length. But you and Liprica were always kind to me, and I appreciated it. …You don’t look thrilled. I’m sorry. Is it hard hearing stories of the past? I understand why you’d feel that way, but I’ve been in hiding ever since. For me, memories of you from the villa are some of my only happy ones.

Conrad: …Hmm? You want to hear about the night the villa was burned? My mother’s handmaiden snuck me out through an underground passage. When I asked about you, they told me you’d died. I remember running through the night, half-blind from crying. We didn’t stop till we crossed into Rigel, where I settled in the hamlet. After that, it was long days of sword practice and studying under Halcyon. Not to mention doing all his cleaning and cooking and laundry. Heh. I didn’t mind. He was hiding me, and it’s not like there were servants around. So if you ever get hungry, just say the word and I’ll whip up something tasty!

Conrad: Duma Tower isn’t far now. How are you feeling, Anthiese? Are you scared? Of course you’d say that. You’re as strong as they come. But don’t forget you have me and everyone else at your back, okay? I’m not suggesting you don’t believe in us. It’s more like… Sometimes it’s like you’re running off ahead without us, and it’s…lonely. I don’t know. Sorry. I’m not doing a great job of explaining this.

Mae: Hey…Celica? You’re not hiding something from us, are you? Sorry if it’s weird, but I just… I dunno. I kind of got that feeling. And you’ve always been the type to deal with all your problems on your own. Anyway, I just wanted you to know you can talk to me about anything, okay?

Boey: We’re almost to Duma Tower and the end of our travels. It’s been a rough journey, but I’m still kind of sad to see it end. I always thought my whole life would pass without me ever leaving the island. But I’ve gotten to experience so much, and for that, I’m thankful. I hope you’ll let me stay by your side to the bitter end.

Genny: The Rigelian Empire is so cold! It’s a bit unsettling. Let’s hurry and save Mila so we can get back home. Then I can turn this adventure into a thrilling epoch for the ages! It’s the story of a plucky princess who overcomes tremendous obstacles. A princess who is reunited with her long-lost father in the end. All her life, she’s carried a pendant— a memento of her departed mother. But it turns out that pendant was a gift from the princess’s father, the king! In the end, the king tracks the pendant down in order to find his lost child. …What do you think? Isn’t it great? I’m already brainstorming the sequel!

Forsyth: When I first enlisted, the Deliverance was shorthanded. And yet, the men running it were still all knights of noble birth. Only one of them paid any heed at all to my or Python’s exploits. …That’s right. It was Sir Clive. He made me a lieutenant even when the others cried no. Then he made sure Python was taken care of as well. I’m not sure Python fully appreciates it, but that’s a separate issue. With so many people opposing me, I knew I’d never truly be their equal. But the chance Sir Clive gave me meant something, and I shall never forget it. I swore to follow that man to the ends of Valentia if he asked.

Palla: Celica, do you have someone you fancy? Heh. Oh, there’s no need to be so flustered. It’s just us girls here—it can’t hurt to talk about boys now and again. …Hmm? What about me? Well, I wouldn’t say there’s no one. Though I expect I’ll take my feelings with me into the cold earth. Giving voice to them would only hurt those who I hold most dear.

Catria: I still can’t believe you’re a princess, Celica. What a surprise! Oh! Is it even appropriate for me to be speaking to you like this? …Er, ma’am? …How’s that? You don’t mind? Oh good. I’m glad. People of high birth have their own unique set of troubles, I’m sure. But there’s still some part of me which envies them. Perhaps it’s because I don’t know the kinds of burdens they carry. If only I could stand as an equal and see the world as they do… …Hm? Did I have someone specific in mind? N-no, I’m just thinking aloud…

Est: My sister Palla is very kind. I mean, she’s always got some little barb or criticism ready, but that’s okay. I think in some ways, she still sees me as a little girl. Now Catria… Well, I’ve never really known what she’s thinking. She doesn’t really say much unless you ask directly. I wish she’d open up. Still, I love ’em both to bits. I’m very proud of my sisters.

Est: I had no intention of going back to the front lines to fight, you know. I actually wanted to open a shop with my love and live like a normal girl. But right when I got that chance, it all turned around and…welp, here I am. My sisters say that being the youngest, I’m good at adapting to situations, but being adaptable doesn’t mean much when your luck is as terrible as mine! They think I’ve had it pretty easy, but it’s actually been tough for me. I have to admit, sometimes I wish they could understand that a bit more…

Kamui: I didn’t know Valbar before he hired me. We just happened to meet up. Turned out to be a fine little adventure, all in all. Truth be told, I don’t know what I’m going to do once it’s over. Still, I feel like it’s scratched my wanderlust itch for the time being. Maybe I’ll settle down for a while. See what kind of life I can build.

Leon: When I was a kid, there was this guy that I was head over heels for. He’s the reason I enlisted, actually. Just so I could stay close to him. He died in the first battle we fought. I cried so hard, I thought my eyes were going to float clean out of my skull. Valbar saved me from that. Every time he saw me, he’d take the time to say something. Cheer me up. What can you do with a man like that but fall in love? You’re thinking I’m a tramp, aren’t you? Well, I’m not. It’s hardly my fault that the world is full of wonderful, lovable people. Such a thing really motivates one to get out there and save it.

Sonya: You’ve got a pretty face, Celica, yet somehow you’re just so…plain. As a princess, shouldn’t you be decked out in silk and gold and other fineries? …That stuff just gets in the way? Ugh, you’re such a pragmatist. If it were me, I’d be swimming in jewels! Maybe even wear my hair up… Don’t you think it’s fun to daydream about that sort of thing? I lived in a priory when I was a child, you know. Wearing the same drab habit… Praying day after day after day… Well. no thank you. I’m done with all that. If beautiful women don’t celebrate their beauty, the entire human race loses out. Don’t you agree?

Sonya: Growing up, I had two older sisters. The eldest was stern, but deeply kind. The middle one was smart and mature, and also marched to her own beat. The three of us were inseparable back at the priory. We waited for our father to come get us, yet knew the day would never come. Ah, but that was a lifetime ago. And they’re both gone now…

Nomah: Ah, Celica. How are you feeling, little one? Rigel’s cold is hard on these old bones. It’s not my first time bearing it, though. In fact… Hmm, let me think… Goodness! I suppose the last time I was here was over forty years ago. It all passes in the blink of an eye…

Nomah: I mentioned that I’d traveled to Rigel previously, yes? That was when I first met Mycen. …What, didn’t you know? Oh yes. Mycen originally hails from Rigel. We were both so young back then… Ha! Those are fond memories.

Nomah: I never took a wife or sired children. I’ve dedicated my life to the teachings of Mila. But I’ve had the chance to watch you, Celica, as well as Mae and Boey. You’ve all become such fine, noble-hearted youths. Seeing you grow up has given me both joy and a sense of purpose. I pray you’ll each live out rich lives of your own, unfettered and free.

Clive: Look how far we’ve come, Alm. In truth, there were times along the way where I often questioned my choices, but now, I do believe them all to have been sound. Thank you, Alm, for being everything I hoped you would be. …Enough woolgathering, though. Rigel Castle is in sight. Lead us to the end of this wretched war once and for all.

Jesse: …My family? Woof. It’s been forever since I’ve seen ’em, honestly. They were…strict, I guess you’d call it. Do this, wear that, stop being friends with whomever… I got fed up and took off. I guess some folks just need to live by that kind of tight framework. Me railing against that wasn’t going to make anyone happy, you know? So I figure I’ll find my own place where I can live in a way that does.

Valbar: Guess our little trip ends once we get to the tower. It wound up being a lot more than just a stroll to the Temple of Mila. Anyway…thanks for everything. I’m glad I got the chance to travel with you. I never thought about what I’d do after Barth, but you gave me purpose. That’s a princess for you, I guess! Heh heh. You and your friends are a great group. It’s been fun. Thanks for letting me see it through to the end.

Saber: Never thought I’d wind up all the way in the damn belly of the empire… Not like it’s a huge problem or nothin’. I’m just saying. Er, I mean… Ah, hell. Might as well spill it. …I’m Rigelian. No deal to me one way or the other— just didn’t think I’d ever be back, is all. Don’t have too many good memories of the place, but nostalgia’s a funny thing.

Deen: Awfully persistent, aren’t you? …Ah, I shouldn’t take that tone with you anymore. Forgive me, Your Highness Princess Anthiese of Zofia. Please pay this humble soldier no mind.

Deen: Still not going to leave me in peace? Guess it’s my own fault for stickin’ around longer than I expected. I don’t know if you’ll be involved in ruling Zofia or not, but don’t forget the tragedies the last royals brought about with their choices. Taking down Desaix and bringing Mila back home won’t revive the fallen. …That’s all I wanted to say.
