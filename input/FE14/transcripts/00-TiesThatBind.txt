@Cutscene 
Azura: You are the ocean's gray waves, destined to seek ♪ Life beyond the shore, just out of reach.

Azura: Yet the waters ever change, flowing like time ♪ The path is yours to climb.

Ryoma: Nohrian general! You face the high prince of Hoshido, Ryoma! I challenge you to single combat!
Xander: I will accept your challenge, "high prince". But I'm no general. I am crown prince Xander of Nohr!

@Intro 
Hinoka: Come on, Corrin! We've got work to do.

Hinoka: Corrin, what's the matter with you? You seem distracted... If you're worried, don't be. All your siblings are here with you. The Nohrians don't stand a chance!

@Battle 
Hinoka: Ready to attack?

Ryoma: I demand to know why you Nohrian dogs are invading Hoshido! Was that cowardly attack on my people your doing as well, princeling?
Xander: ...I have nothing to say to you. Surrender now. If you refuse...you die here.

Elise: Oh, no! The bridge collapsed! How can we help our brother/sister now?
Camilla: Not to worry, Elise. This royal blood in our veins is still good for something!
Leo: Have you spotted a Dragon Vein, Camilla?
Camilla: You know me too well, dear little brother!

Elise: Yaaay, it worked! The river dried up!
Camilla: I would never let you down, darling. Now, everyone follow me.
Leo: Elise, you're not ready for the front lines. Stay back. Camilla, and I will take care of the Hoshidans.

Hinoka: The Nohrian army used a Dragon Vein to dry up the river! But I thought only royals held that power...
Takumi: Yeah, which means there must be some real big shots over there. Suit me just fine. I've always wanted to use a Nohrian royal for target practice!
Hinoka: Stay focused, Corrin. The Nohrians brought their heavy hitters this time.

Hans: Listen up, cannon fodder! We have a direct order from King Garon. He says kill 'em all!
Hinoka: Dammit, their reinforcements had arrived! I'll go scout out how many there are. Takumi, Sakura, Stay with Corrin!
Takumi: Understood.
Sakura: Y-yes. Good idea.

Takumi: Hang in there, Corrin. The Nohrian royals are not pushovers... We'll have to work together to beat them. As the eldest, I guess you're in charge. Tell me what to do and I'll do it.

Sakura: Are you hurt, Corrin!? Here, let me heal your wounds!

Yukimura: Comrades! Do not let them cross this line. We must defend Hoshido.

Sakura: Oh n-no! An enemy!
Takumi: It's an ambush! Sakura, stay back. You aren't equipped to fight.
Hinoka: Takumi! Corrin! I'm counting on you two. Work together to defeat that solider!
Takumi:  Listen, here's how we're gonna do this! With my bow, I can shoot this one from here. I'll soften him up, and then you can jump in and finish him off. Got it?
Sakura:  Be careful, Corrin!

@End 
Hinoka: Corrin, Takumi, good work fighting off that ambush.
Sakura: You were amazing, Corrin.
Takumi: That went well. Probably because SOMEONE gave you good advice. ...And you're welcome, by the way.
Hinoka: No time to talk! Let's see how Ryoma's doing.

Hinoka: Ryoma, are you alright?
Ryoma: I'll be fine. I'm glad to see you're all safe. Enemy reinforcements are headed this way. I want you to get rid of them. Corrin, I'm counting on you to keep Hinoka and the others safe.
Xander: Corrin! Thank heavens we found you, and that you're alive and well. Quickly, come join us! Your family has come to take you home where you belong.
Ryoma: Quiet, Nohrian filth! Corrin is my brother/sister and a prince/princess of Hoshido!
Xander: On the contrary, Corrin is MY brother/sister and a prince/princess of Nohr!
Camilla: Corrin! I was so worried about you. Don't ever wonder away from me again!
Leo: I'm glad you're OK, Corrin. You must have the devil's own luck!
Elise: Yaaay! We got our brother/sister back!
Hinoka: Nohrian scum! First you kidnap him/her, now you lied to him/her?! Corrin is MY brother/sister, not yours!
Camilla: You are mistaken. Corrin is my sweet little brother/sister. You may not have him/her.
Ryoma: Don't be fool by their words. You belong with your true family in Hoshido!
Xander: We have loved you and raised you since you were a child. Come home, little prince/princess. We can live as a family once more!
Ryoma: Come home to Hoshido, Corrin!
Xander: No, Corrin! Nohr is your home!
