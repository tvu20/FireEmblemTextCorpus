@Intro 
Azura: Ah, how I love to sail upon the ocean! To be free from the confines of land! The roar of the waves is like the sweetest lullaby.

Felicia: We've got trouble, Lady Azura!
Azura: Slow down, Felicia. Tell me what's happened.
Felicia: Um...um...a pegasus—I mean, the young man riding it— He's just crashed onto our ship! Well, the pegasus did too, but—
Azura: What was that?! Someone on a pegasus has just landed? Point the way!

Jakob: We have trouble, Azura!
Azura: How can that be, Jakob? We're so far upon the ocean!
Jakob: I've just receive news that a young man riding a pegasus has landed upon our ship. At breakneck speed, too. He and his steed may have sustained serious injuries.
Azura: What was that?! A pegasus rider? Please, point the way!

Azura: Shigure, my son! What has brought you out here?
Shigure: M...Mother...? Did I make it? I...I flew out of the Deeprealms to find you!
Azura: Oh, my! You're hurt! And your pegasus looks ready to collapse!
Shigure: Never mind us. We need to return to my Deeprealm at once. My village is under attack. You and your friends must help me save whoever's left.
Azura: What's that? Your village—? But from what enemy?
Shigure: I...I don't know. It's hard to see them sometimes.
Azura: What?
Shigure: They're only semivisible. But they're fierce fighters. One thing I am sure is that they're after ME. My friends risked their lives helping me get away. I...I think they're all...
Azura: Shigure, you don't know that. Wait, I sense something...someone...

Shigure: It's them!
Azura: My apologies, Shigure. This grim turn of events is all my fault. They're after you...because of me.
Shigure: Come again? What do you have to do with this, Mother?
Azura: Well, I can't explain. Not here. Now, a moment, please.

Azura: Shigure, stay close! I'm certain those fiends are readying an attack. But if they think they're getting their hands on you...
Shigure: Mother, who are they? Why did you say this is all your fault?
Azura: I'm sorry to say it must remain a mystery, at least for a little longer.
Shigure: Tell that to my friends.
Azura: Trust me, Son. I had little choice. Now, hide yourself. I'll take care of them. That's the least I can do.
Shigure: It's just...it's just not right. My whole village, and because of what? You must have your reasons for keeping such deadly secrets, Mother. But this fight is now MINE too. I must avenge my friends.
Azura: ... Listen, Shigure. The stakes are higher than you can imagine. But if you insist in fighting, then promise that you'll do so at a safe distance.
Shigure: No. My friends didn't have any such choice. I won't shy from battle.
Azura: I see. Then I promise that MY friends will keep you safe as can be. Losing you would ruin me. You will live, my son, even if it's at the cost of my life.
Shigure: No, Mother!
Azura: We won't lose. Not if I can help it. My friends and I will make them pay. Everyone, prepare for battle!
Shigure: I’m with you all the way, Mother.

@Battle 
Azura: We've been broadsided! Stay on guard everyone!

@End 
Azura: Shigure, the battle is won, but your worst fears have proven true. I slipped away to your Deeprealm for a moment. These invaders... They razed your village. There is no one left. Everyone who took care of you in my stead, all of them are—
Shigure: EVERYONE? Ohhhh... No, no, no... NOOOO!
Azura: ... I'm sorry. If we'd come sooner... That is, if only I'd warned you about them...
Shigure: No. You and your friends have clearly known these evils and more. I'm at fault for being a child too long. My eyes have been closed. But my heart has been opened. I can imagine, a little, what it must feel like to live in your world. Still you find it in yourself to sing. And so must I.
Azura: Sing? What are you going to sing?
Shigure: You know the song well, Mother. ♪

Azura: Truly, how well I do. You plan to sing it as a requiem for your dead? How beautiful. Even beyond the clouds, your friends will be moved to tears. Surely, a melancholy rain will fall upon your village.
Shigure: Mother! But what am I to do now? Everyone I knew, except you—
Azura: Ah, I have no choice but to find another place to hide you.
Shigure: I...I don't want to hide anymore. I'm joining your cause.
Azura: What's that? Son, you must stay safe!
Shigure: No. My friends lost their lives trying to save me. I need to learn to protect myself. I need to get strong enough, so I can make the same sacrifice for others.
Azura: ... Very well, Shigure. But you must let me protect you when I can. You cannot deny your mother that.
Shigure: My heart is singing. And it's a song of hope for the future.
Azura: Let us make it a duet, Son.
Shigure: Yes, Mother. It will be my honor.
