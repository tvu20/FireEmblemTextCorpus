@Intro 
Eyvel: Little Lady! You're a sight for sore eyes!
Nanna: Eyvel…
Eyvel: I can't tell you how glad I am that you're safe, Little Nan. Did that maggot Raydrik hurt you?
Nanna: I-I'm fine, but... but Mareeta, she...
Eyvel: Mareeta?! What's happened to my Mareeta?!
Nanna: I don't know if she's even alive... We were separated as soon as we got to the castle.
Eyvel: Raydrik! This your idea of a joke?! You gave me your word that I could see my daughter! Are you such an excuse of a man that even your word means nothing?!
Raydrik: I never lied. Of course you can see your daughter. I just made a small... omission.
Nanna: Look out, Eyvel! There's armed men coming toward us!
Eyvel: Tch!
Raydrik: These are my terms: defeat my prized pitfighters, and you can see your daughter.
Eyvel: ……
Raydrik: Ah, here they come now. Pitfighters, meet Eyvel. Eyvel, pitfighters. You've had your introductions—let it never be said that I'm a poor host.
Nanna: E-Eyvel...
Eyvel: ...Little Nan, this is gonna get real dangerous, real quick. Stay clear and keep your head down.

@Battle 
Raydrik: A thousand apologies to have kept you waiting, Bishop Veld.
Veld: Raydrik, you could not make one apology and mean it, much less a thousand. For the Baron of such a troubled area as Munster, you seem to have an abundance of free time. These theatrics are not what you promised you would spend your time on.
Raydrik: I am... certain Your Eminence will enjoy the spectacle I've prepared.
Veld: *Sigh* Oh, very well. I could do with a moment's diversion.
Raydrik: Well, it's all in her hands now... That "Swordmaster" better live up to her name. Ah, and now the star takes center stage! Heh, heh, heh...

Raydrik: Tch... In the end, she was a shadow of what the rumors made her out to be.
Soldier: What do you want done with her, sire?
Veld: Don't kill her, Raydrik. Leave her fate in my hands.
Eyvel: Wh-What...?
Soldier: G-Gods' breath... Your spellcraft is truly a sight to behold, Your Eminence. Not even the wildest fable could compare to this...
Veld: Heh, heh, heh...
Raydrik: A-And now I have a perfect statue of the proud swordswoman of Fiana—an eternal monument to the price of defiance! Ahahaha!

Soldier: ...What about Finn's little brat?
Raydrik: Hmm... Leave the girl be. That fragile little thing couldn't escape the castle. After this, I'm sure she'll serve as a most entertaining diversion!
Soldier: As you wish, sire.
Nanna: …Eyvel…

Raydrik: She's even more skilled than I'd hoped...! How delightful! Here, a reward befitting a magnificent performer!
Eyvel: What're you scheming?!
Raydrik: Heh... Bring the girl out!
Eyvel: M-Mareeta...?
Mareeta: ……
Nanna: Mareeta, Mareeta! Oh, you're safe after all! I can't tell you how worried I—
Eyvel: Little Nan, don't move a muscle!
Nanna: Huh?
Mareeta: ……
Eyvel: Mareeta! Talk to me...!
Mareeta: ...K-Kill... ...Kill... Kill... KILL... WITH THIS SWORD... ALL...ALL... ALL OF YOU... KILL ALL OF YOU!
Eyvel: ...Mareeta... you...
Raydrik: Mother and daughter, reunited at last! Tell me, is she all that you remembered, Eyvel?
Eyvel: ...What have you done to my Mareeta?!
Raydrik: Me? I didn't do anything. Quite the contrary: she was trying to escape, so I gave her that sword to grant her a fighting chance. It's an exceptional blade, straight from the treasure vault inside this very castle. ...The Shadow Sword, I believe it's called.
Eyvel: The Shadow Sword, a cursed blade... You trying to turn my Mareeta into one of your damned pitfighters with your little gift?
Raydrik: My gift is cursed, you say? Well, this is the first I'm hearing of it.
Eyvel: I'll rip that lying tongue right out of your mouth! How... How dare you do this to Mar—
Raydrik: Amusing as your threats are, shouldn't you be worrying about yourself right now? The Shadow Sword bears incredible power—an exceptional gift for an exceptional woman! Ahahaha...!
Eyvel: Raydrik...! Mareeta, look at me! Snap out of it!
Mareeta: ……

Raydrik: What's the meaning of this? The girl wields the Shadow Sword, yet she struggles to finish the job!
Veld: Hmm... The blade does not appear to rule over her completely.
Raydrik: That's absurd! As if that mere child could... could—
Veld: The memories of her mother make her falter and hesitate. Her emotions dull the sword's strength the same as running its edge across stone. She's like a caged animal, desperately throwing herself against her binds. Or have you not even noticed her tears, you imbecile?

Mareeta: Argh...! Let go... LET GO...
Eyvel: ...Sorry about this, Mareeta.
Mareeta: Ugh...!
Raydrik: What...?! She's been knocked out cold... Is this some kind of jest...?!
Eyvel: ...Raydrik, you hellspawn... As long as my heart beats, I'll never forgive you...

@Boss
Mareeta: ……
Eyvel: ...Mareeta... I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...
Raydrik: She prevailed against even the Shadow Sword... Is this some kind of jest...?!
Eyvel: ...Raydrik, you hellspawn... As long as my heart beats, I'll never forgive you...
Raydrik: D-Damn…!

@Battle 
Raydrik: Th-The woman's a beast...! F-Fine, the girl wasn't enough for you?! Let's see how you do against my entire garrison! All hands, enter the arena and stain the ground with her blood!

Leif: Nanna! You're safe!
Nanna: L-Lord Leif! Please, you have to help Eyvel! I don't know how much more of this she can take!
Leif: Leave it to us—but stay behind me, Nanna! Commander, are you all right?
Eyvel: Little Lord! Everyone! Heh, good to see you all made it!
Leif: I can't begin to thank you for protecting Nanna in this ghastly place.
Eyvel: Would that I could've done the same for my own kin...
Leif: No... What's happened to Mareeta?
Veld: Panicking already, Raydrik? Fear not. I'll clean up your mess for you.
Eyvel: Wh-What...?!
Raydrik: G-Gods' breath... Your spellcraft is truly a sight to behold, Your Eminence. Not even the wildest fable could compare to this...
Veld: Heh, heh, heh...
Raydrik: A-And now I have a perfect statue of the proud warrior of Fiana—an eternal monument to the price of defiance! Ahahaha! We've nothing to fear now! There's no rescuing a block of stone!

Nanna: Eyvel... I'm sorry. I'll always honor your sacrifice...

@End
Leif: I'll come back for you, Commander! I'll... I'll grow strong enough to storm this whole city if I have to! No force in all the heavens can stop me! So just... just... ......
