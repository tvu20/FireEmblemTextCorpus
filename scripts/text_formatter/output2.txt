“Are you awake?”

Girl:
“I found you unconscious on the plains.”

Lyn:
“I am Lyn, of the Lorca tribe. You’re safe now. Who are you? Can you remember your name?”

Lyn:
“Your name is Mark? What an odd-sounding name… But pay me no mind. It is a good name. I see by your attire that you are a traveller. What brings you to the Sacae plains? Would you share your story with me? Hm? What was that noise? I’ll go see what’s happening. Mark, wait here for me.”

Lyn:
“Oh no! Bandits! They must have come down from the Bern mountains! They must be planning on raiding the local villages. I… I have to stop them! If that’s all of them, I think I can handle them on my own. You’ll be safe in here, Mark.”

Lyn:
“What? You want to help? Well, can you use a weapon?”

Lyn:
“Ah, I see… So you’re a strategist by trade? An odd profession, but… Very well. We’ll go together!”
