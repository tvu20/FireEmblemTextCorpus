Zeis: “Sir Gale…”
Gale: “Zeis. You seem well.”
Zeis: “Sir Gale… Must we fight?”
Gale: “Yes. We must.”
Zeis: “I… I don’t want to fight you! You’re the last person…”
Gale: “Zeis! Don’t be a child!”
Zeis: “Huh…!?”
Gale: “Did you have only so much resolve when you left Bern? Is that all the resolve you had when you decided to fight against Bern!?”
Zeis: “No! My mind is…set… Even now, it hurts to point my blade toward Bern, my homeland… But I believed with my heart that the path I chose wasn’t a mistake…!”
Gale: “Then cast away your hesitation! Focus on crushing those who block the path that you have chosen. …No matter who it is.”
Zeis: “Sir Gale…”
Gale: “Zeis… Were you not a knight of Bern?”
Zeis: “…Of course I am!”
Gale: “Good! When we meet next time, neither of us will speak. We will fight!”
 
Miredy: “Gale…”
Gale: “Miredy…”
Miredy: “Gale… I…”
Gale: “Don’t speak… You and I are both loyal knights. We both fight for whom we have pledged our loyalty to. That’s all.”
Miredy: “……”
Gale: “Miredy… This is probably the end, so let me say this. Miredy, I am truly grateful that I was able to meet you. We trained our skills together, and we fought alongside each other. Miredy… The days I spent with you… Those were the happiest days of my life.”
Miredy: “Me… Mine, too…”
Gale: “…Goodbye, Miredy… I always wish we had met in a more peaceful time.”
Miredy: “Gale…”
Miredy: “Wait…! Gale! Don’t go! Gaaaaaaaaaale!”
