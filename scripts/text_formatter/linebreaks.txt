???: You bear the mark. So that's your secret, is it? The blood of the laguz runs through your veins.
Zelgius: Yes. There was someone on my father's side who...who was with a laguz.


Zelgius: My lord...the brand...do you know of a way to remove it? This cursed thing, I...I am an outcast from my family. I joined the military to escape the shame and hatred in their eyes... I live in fear of discovery. When I think that I might see that same shame and hatred in another's eyes, I... I come close to despair... I have lived my life alone, unable to trust or become close to anyone.
???: Such loneliness and isolation. You poor child... It pains me to tell you that I know of no way to remove your brand.
Zelgius: I...I understand... It was a foolish question. I apologize.


Zelgius: Lord Sage, I-- I realized some years ago that I was aging more slowly than others do.
???: And you wish to conceal that fact, don't you? Is that why you rarely remove your armor, even when indoors?
Zelgius: Yes...but this ruse will not last indefinitely. In a few years, I will be forced to leave this army's service.
???: And once again, you will be alone.
Zelgius: I am accustomed to being alone. My only hesitation, is that...I will miss studying the sword under my commander, General Gawain.
???: When the time comes for you to leave, will you come to me, perhaps?
Zelgius: My lord?
???: We share a...similar condition. I see something familiar within you. I can... understand your pain and isolation.
Zelgius: But why me?
???: I have a task that I must accomplish. With you at my side, I would feel more confident of my success.
Zelgius: If I join you, will I be redeemed?
???: I cannot say. At the very least, however, you will no longer be alone. And neither will I.
Zelgius: That is enough, then. You have made my decision simple. When I leave here I will find you.


Zelgius: I am a soldier in the Daein army. I serve under the command of General Gawain. My name is Zelgius. May I ask your name, my lord sage?


???: My name? Of course...
