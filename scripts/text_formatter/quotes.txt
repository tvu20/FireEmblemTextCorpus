Seth: “Prince Ephraim, Princess Eirika. The castle has been secured. And…”
Ephraim: “What is it?”
Seth: “…This way. This is the room Orson was holed up in.”
 
Monica: “…Darling…”
Ephraim: “You, you’re Orson’s…”
Eirika: “……”
Monica: “Darling. Darling. Darling…darling…darling…darling…”
Ephraim: “…What?! This…is horrible…”
Eirika: “……Oh!”
Ephraim: “This same magic was used to control Emperor Vigarde. She’s already dead, and her corpse was used to…”
Eirika: “Who? Who could…”
Ephraim: “You needn’t look any longer, Eirika. Let’s go outside.”
Monica: “Darling. Darling…darling…”
 
Seth: “…You can’t say this thing is truly alive anymore. I’ll…”
Ephraim: “No… I’ll do it. …The two of them spent every day in here, did they? Orson was mad. But I think he was happy…”
 
Ephraim: “We’ve finally made it back. Yet…”
Eirika: “Mmm… We can repair the castle, and what was stolen, we can do without. But the wounds and suffering inflicted upon the people of Renais…”
Ephraim: “It’s too late to undo their pain. Once I become king, I must set our country right. I doubt the people will give me a warm reception, though. I did abandon them. All I can do is try to win back their trust, no matter how long it takes…”
 
Seth: “Princess Eirika, Prince Ephraim. You should look outside.”
Ephraim: “Outside?”
 
People: “Prince Ephraim! Princess Eirika! The king has returned! Our king! Glory to Renais! Long live King Ephraim!”
Ephraim: “……”
Seth: “…They’re not cheering for you. They cheer because Orson’s misrule is at an end. They cheer the possibility of a better tomorrow, not the deeds we did today. But how will the hearts of the people move tomorrow and the next day? That is for you to decide.”
Ephraim: “I will not let their hopes and dreams be shattered again. I will be king. Like my father before me, I will dedicate myself to their happiness.”
Eirika: “And I will do all I can to help, Ephraim.”
 
Seth: “Prince Ephraim, Princess Eirika. Before Renais fell, King Fado entrusted me with this message: “Raise the twins?bracelets in the hall of kings. The seal will be broken. The resting place of the Sacred Stone will be revealed…?br>”
Ephraim: “I understand.”
Eirika: “So we’re supposed to raise our bracelets over our heads, right?”
Ephraim: “Let’s try it, Eirika.”
Eirika: “I’m ready, Ephraim.”
 
 
Ephraim: “This is the Stone of Renais…”
Eirika: “Yes. This is one of the five stones that defeated the Demon King.”
Ephraim: “If Lyon had acquired our bracelets, the stone would have been destroyed by now. Together, we protected the only power that can help us stop Lyon’s insanity.”
Eirika: “Yes. It’s the only hope left to us. Hope for you and me, and the last true hope for peace…”
Ephraim: “Let’s get back, Eirika.”
Eirika: “…Huh? Brother, look! Our bracelets, they’re…”
Ephraim: “What is this? Are they reacting to the light of the stone? Eirika’s Lunar Brace and Ephraim’s Solar Brace glow in response to the Sacred Stone. With the power of the bracelets, the twins can now change classes.”
 
 
Eirika: “I can’t believe the bracelets contain so much power…”
Ephraim: “I wonder if Father anticipated all of this long ago. When I was growing up, I never thought about becoming king. I only wanted to be a good soldier, a good warrior. The best on the battlefield. Father never understood what I wanted, but… I never understood him, either.”
Eirika: “……”
Ephraim: “It was the same when Grado invaded Renais. I should have stayed home to defend the kingdom… Instead, I raced off to fight for personal glory.”
Eirika: “Brother… I don’t think you know how well Father understood your feelings. When I last saw him, he was concerned for nothing but our safety…”
 
Seth: “Eirika is correct. King Fado asked after your exploits every day. He always told me what a fine king you would one day make.”
Ephraim: “Father…”
Seth: “Now Prince Ephraim, Princess Eirika. Please follow me. The Sacred Twins of Renais should be near the stone’s reliquary.”
 
Seth: “Ah, here we go. This lance can only be one of the Sacred Twins of Renais. Please, Prince Ephraim, take this sacred relic and feel its weight.”
Ephraim: “So this is one of our Sacred Twin relics, is it? I’ve never seen them. Look, there’s a name inscribed here. Siegmund, the Flame Lance.”
 
Seth: “And this blade is sister to the lance, the other Sacred Twin of legend. Princess Eirika, if you would?”
Eirika: “Of course. There’s a name carved here as well. Sieglinde, the Thunder Blade…”
 
Eirika: “These are the ancient weapons of our ancestors–the weapons of heroes. They were enshrined generations ago, to be used only by the king… and only in times of dire need. Such an awful power they possess, and yet we need them to restore peace. I’ve seen enough of the horrors of war, but I can’t turn my back on it. If we merely turn our eyes away, we surrender our world to atrocity. And so, I must fight. I’ll do whatever I must do to bring back the peace we once knew.”
 
L’Arachel: “What is happening? Have you found the Sacred Stone?”
Eirika: “Yes. Here it is…”
L’Arachel: “Wow! It truly is spectacular. This goes some way to brighten the dark shadows that loom over us.”
Innes: “Our countries?Sacred Stones have been shattered by Grado’s men. The Stone of Renais is our last remaining weapon.”
L’Arachel: “No, it’s not. You have forgotten the stone of my beloved Rausten. Remember, there were five Sacred Stones for our five nations. The Stones of Grado, Frelia, and Jehanna are gone, but hope is not. We have the Stone of Renais, after all, and that of Rausten is safe. Our road is clear, my friends. I must guide you to Rausten.”
Eirika: “You’re right. L’Arachel, we’re counting on you to lead the way.”
L’Arachel: “Of course. And you will all be welcome to stay in the palace. And, Eirika, you shall be my guest in my own private quarters! Let us be on our way.”
