Hector: “Hey, Eliwood! You made it.”
Eliwood: “I would never turn down an invitation from you. So, are you ready? You once told me being the leader of Lycia wasn’t for you.”
Hector: “Well…yes. Now that word of my brother’s death has spread, the throne can’t be left empty forever. My brother let me play around for quite a while. If I don’t grow up soon, he may start screaming at me from the grave.”
Eliwood: “Ha ha! You’re probably right.”
Hector: “The burdens Uther carried as Marquess Ostia, his feelings for the citizenry of Ostia and all of Lycia… I’ll succeed him at everything. Easy to say, but I’m sure it’s going to be difficult.”
Lyn: “Hector… Well, if it isn’t Eliwood!”
Eliwood: “Well met, Lyndis. You’ve grown even more fair than when I saw you last.”
Lyn: “Oh… Did you hear that, Hector. That’s the biggest difference between you and Eliwood.”
Hector: “Give me a break.”
Eliwood: “Hector may not say it, but more than anyone else, that is what he thinks. Isn’t that so, Hector?”
Lyn: “Really?”
Hector: “Eliwood! You…”
Farina: “Lord Hector… Hm? Is that you, Lord Eliwood? Wah! It’s been such a very long time!”
Eliwood: “Nice to see you again, Farina. We didn’t have too many chances to talk during our journey, but…”
Farina: “That’s true.”
Hector: “Well, you’ll have plenty of opportunity from now on. Let me introduce you… This here’s the 20,000 gold woman.”
Eliwood: “Huh?”
Farina: “Hold it! Are you still angry about that? That was a reasonable sum, and it included hazard pay!”
Eliwood: “Hm?”
Florina: “Lord Hector… Ah… Lord Eliwood… It’s, um, nice to see you again.”
Eliwood: “Hello, Florina. Have you grown used to life here in Ostia?”
Florina: “Yes, yes…”
Hector: “Truly? You still get tongue-tied in front of crowds.”
Florina: “Ye-Yes…”
Hector: “As the wife of Marquess Ostia, you must be able to speak in public. That has me somewhat worried.”
Florina: “I-I’m sorry… I’ll…do…better… Sniff…”
Hector: “OK! OK! I understand, so don’t cry! It’s all my fault! Please!”
Florina: “OK…”
Oswin: “I beg your pardon. Lord Hector, shall we?”
Hector: “Yeah, OK.:Say, Eliwood, do you remember old Athos Graybeard’s final words?”
Eliwood: “Of course.”
Hector: “I sealed Armads away, like it used to be, but… I can still feel its power pulsing inside me. War is coming. Someday, a terrible war… When that day comes…”
Eliwood: “Mm, I understand. When it comes, we’ll fight together. For our future and for our children’s.”
