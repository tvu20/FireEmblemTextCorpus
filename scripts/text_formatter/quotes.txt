Elder: “Ah, Master Roy. It has been a long time.”
Roy: “I had business in these areas, so I decided to stop by on the way.”
Elder: “Fa will be glad to see you.”
Roy: “I saw her earlier. She is as energetic as ever.”
Elder: “She is being allowed outside more often these days. Perhaps that is why.”
Roy: “How is the girl that I sent here doing?”
Elder: “We succeeded in restoring her soul, but…”
Roy: “…She still won’t go back to normal?”
Elder: “Fa sometimes takes her outside, but she won’t try to do anything on her own.”
Roy: “I see…”
Elder: “Master Roy… We knew that the girl you sent here was captured by the Dragons. Still, we did not try and rescue her. We feared that our kind would be in danger if we showed ourselves in front of the other Dragons again. But now, I wonder whether my judgment was correct.”
Roy: “……”
Elder: “Perhaps it is because we have begun to live with humans. I will make my best efforts to bring back the girl’s heart fully.”
Roy: “…Thank you.”
Elder: “As a first, I would like to see some kind of sign that her emotions are working… Perhaps laughing or crying…anything…”
 
Fa: “And that is called a tree!”
Idoun: “Tree…”
Fa: “Right! And that tree gives yummy fruit!”
Idoun: “Fruit?”
Fa: “Yes. Can you see? It’s up at the top. And if you shake the tree like this…”
Fa: “Oww! It fell on Fa’s head…”
Idoun: “(laughs)”
Fa: “…? Did you just laugh?”
Idoun: “…Laugh? Me?”
Fa: “Yeah! You just laughed! Yes! You laughed!”
Idoun: “Laugh…? This is to laugh?”
Fa: “Where’s Roy? Roy! Fa has to tell Roy that Idoun laughed!”
Idoun: “A warm…breeze…”
