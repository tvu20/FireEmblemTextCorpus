Female Voice 1: Lehran... I will not...countenance this plan.

[an image of Ashera's veiled bed appears]

Male Voice 1: Hear me, Goddess Ashera... Yune's imprisonment within the
    medallion has begun to change you. Order and chaos, you are one being,
    comprising both parts. The one must naturally affect the other.

Female Voice 1: Even so, I will not return Yune to this body. She is unstable,
    and I must be perfect in order to protect this world. It is as I have said,
    Yune must be destroyed.

Male Voice 1: Ashera, you mustn't! You cannot survive without your opposite.
    Please, you must not do this. Your world still needs you.

Female Voice 1: Lehran, you have ever been a wise and kind-hearted child. In
    deference to you, I will place my faith in your kind once last time. For
    the next thousand years, I shall sleep as well. When I wake again, I hope
    it is to a world of peace and order, where all prosper as equals.

[a long pause]

Female Voice 1: If I do, then I will know that you have advised me well. I will
    reward your counsel. I will also allow Yune to return to me. I will once
    again be the goddess of creation, whole and complete. Ashunera, the Dawn
    Goddess... The name your ancestors gave me so long ago. I should like to
    hear it again.

[the image changes to that same hand holding the medallion, but against the
    shimmering veils and blue wall]

Female Voice 1: However, during this thousand years, if the chaos of war should
    arise and awaken Yune from her slumber in the medallion... I will know that
    you have strayed from your path, and I will punish your failure as I would
    reward your success. And then you will know my judgment. You will pay for
    your sins, each of you to the last.

[the image changes back to the one of the veiled bed]

Male Voice 1: In the names of our people, we vow to keep this covenant. There
    will be no great war between laguz and beorc for a thousand years. So
    pledge Altina of the beorc, Dheginsea of the dragon tribes, Soan of the
    beast tribes, and I, Lehran, of the bird tribes.

Female Voice 1: If you believe during this thousand years that you have
    created a world that has outgrown the atrocities of war... Or if you feel
    the world has fallen beyond hope of redemption, you may sing the galdr of
    release and awaken us both. Your heirs will possess that ability as well...
    Sing to awaken us, and tell us your tale. Tell us of the world your two
    kinds have built in our absence. We will listen, and will judge fairly and
    impartially. This is our covenant with you.

[the image fades away]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[on the battlefield, atop a glowing, four-cornered sigil with a circle at each
    corner and a diamond in between them, stands Ashera]

Ike: It's her...

Yune: Ashera.

[Yune moves forward]

Yune: Ashera! It's me...Yune. Can you hear me?

[Ashera has her eyes closed]

Ashera: ...

Yune: Please! Please listen to me! You don't need to pass any more judgment!
    You can return the people to normal!

[Ashera opens her eyes]

Ashera: I cannot. There are still people in my world who are made of fallible
    flesh. This imperfect world has passed beyond control. Now, I shall pass my
    final judgment.

Yune: Wait! You can't violate the terms of the covenant, Ashera! One thousand
    years still hasn't passed. We were woken by galdr, not by mankind's war.

Ashera: It doesn't matter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[cutscene – the battle between Begnion and the Laguz Alliance]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ashera: During my long sleep, beorc and laguz continued to fight. The children
    of flesh will never learn nor grow. Time will pass as always, but nothing
    can change the destiny of mankind.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yune: You have to look deeper! The first judgment didn't turn everyone to
    stone, and I'll tell you why. Because these people are not "people" as we
    know them. Ashera, these people have become something new!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[cutscene – the image of creation, with the goddess standing before laguz and
    animals]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yune: People--the Zunanma--are the only living creatures of this world that we
    didn't create. Animals evolved to become Zunanma, who then became laguz and
    beorc. That evolution continues today!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Yune takes several steps forward]

Yune: Ashera... I'll tell you a secret you didn't know. [she holds out her
    arms] Children can be born of both a beorc and laguz parent. They are still
    very few in number, but if allowed to flourish, mankind might become
    anything! If the two races continue to evolve, I'm sure something wonderful
    will emerge! You can't just bring that to a halt.

Ashera: Do not claim certainty of anything. The children of this world are born
    of chaos, and nothing could be more uncertain. The world does not require
    the evolution of man. My responsibility is to protect order, the balance of
    all life-forms. Beings that evolve without my guidance will only
    destabilize and threaten this world. Because of that--

Yune: You have to wipe out everything made of flesh? Is that what you're trying
    to say? ...Very well then.

Yune: You and I have nothing more to talk about. My only choice is to defeat
    you.

Ashera: Yune, do not be absurd... You cannot overthrow me, just as I cannot
    overthrow you.

Yune: Of course not. But they can. Everyone! The time has come! Defeat Ashera,
    or everyone you love will be a statue forever!

Ashera: These people, they carry your blessing, Yune... You mean to fight me?

Ike: Ashera, our goddess... This is the world--and we are the people--you
    created. You make it sound as if we're some sort of filthy creatures that
    just decided to settle down here and cause trouble.

Yune: Ike! Don't say it like that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[cutscene – the battle between Begnion and the Laguz Alliance]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ike: We're not perfect. Sometimes our brains tell us one thing, while our
    emotions tell us another. And war... The more we try to avoid it, the worse
    it is when it comes to us.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ike: People are probably the dumbest creatures alive.

Yune: But... Somehow you're also the most endearing. It's your imperfections
    that make you so interesting... Imperfections very similar to ours.

Ike: We know that we've messed up. We'll do our best to avoid more war and to
    make peace our highest priority. Ashera, just give us one more chance. All
    we ask for is one more chance.

Ashera: You expect me to reverse my judgment? The goddess of order cannot be
    so...mercurial. My decision is final.

Ike: So that's how it's going to be, huh? Then we will fight... [he unsheathes
    his sword] and we will save our people. Make your peace with whatever the
    gods worship. Your end is near.

[the sigil that Ashera stands on begins to glow even brighter]

Ashera: My end [she raises her arms] is near? 

Ike: In every battle that mattered in my life, I've always been the one left
    standing, no matter how slim my chances. This battle means more than any of
    the others, because it's for the life of every person that I've ever cared
    about. I will win this fight.

---------------------------------------------------------{base conversations}--

[Part IV Endgame (5); Soren] (*)

Soren: Ike... Um... Were you joking when you said you couldn't remember how we
    met?

Ike: Well, sorta. It was a long time ago.

Soren: How could you forget?

Ike: Relax, Soren. I got to thinking, and I remembered. I remember what
    happened in Gallia on the day we first met.

Soren: Ike...

Ike: Mother had gone shopping with Mist that day. I was wandering around the
    village all alone. I walked to the edge of the forest, looking for a stick
    I could pretend was a sword. There was a raven-haired boy lying on the
    ground.

Soren: I remember the huge oak tree by the clearing... I'd been sleeping in the
    hollow by the roots.

Ike: He looked like he was my age. He was as skinny as a twig, wearing rags and
    covered in dirt. He looked like he was near death. I took out my lunch and
    I handed it to him. He made a noise like a scared animal and shied away. He
    was suspicious of me at first, but eventually he took my sandwich and
    started to eat. It was like he'd never eaten before in his life. I didn't
    have anything else to feed him, so I told him to come to my house. But he
    kept shaking his head no.

Soren: I was afraid you were going to trick me. Afraid that you were going to
    chase me away after taunting me with food, just for a laugh...

Ike: I told the boy that I'd bring him some food the next day at the same time
    and place. He finally nodded when I said that. It made me happy. I felt
    like I was doing something right, helping this boy. Like I was the only one
    who'd do that.

Soren: ...I was happy, too. Not just because I wasn't hungry anymore. Because
    someone finally would talk to me. So I went back to the village again the
    next day. I was scared of the other villagers and their rocks and sticks,
    but I still went back.

Ike: That's right. That was Gallia back then. The beorc abused and tormented
    the Branded because the laguz shunned them. They wanted to avoid upsetting
    the laguz.

Soren: The villagers threw stones at me, called me an animal and a devil. But
    on the next day, the village was littered with corpses. Soldiers and
    peasants were in a panic.

Ike: It was my dad. He went crazy when the spirit of chaos in the medallion
    touched him.

Soren: I walked through the empty streets, checking bodies to see if you were
    dead. But I couldn't find you. I decided that you had to be alive. I took
    money and food from the village and headed for Crimea, a land of beorcs.

Ike: Soren...

Soren: On my way to Crimea, I kept seeing laguz from the beast tribe. They
    were terrifying, but after a while I realized something. They never
    attacked me. They all seemed to notice something about me, and then pretend
    they couldn't see me. That look was burned into my mind, and it was always
    the same. They'd scowl, then walk away like they'd never noticed me. In a
    way, that left me feeling older and more alone than if they'd attacked me.
    Hate... That I could understand. This was denial. They made me feel like I
    wasn't supposed to exist at all. That my simply being alive was an affront
    to the world. That was how the beasts treated me. And I hated them for it.
    It sat in my heart like a lead bar. Like a glacier.

Ike: ...

Soren: When I reached Crimea, I took refuge in a church along the way. They
    took my brand to be a sign that I had been trained in the arcane arts.
    They took good care of me, and taught me things. Once I had learned to
    speak and behave like other people, I wandered Crimea for several years.
    Then I finally found you.

Ike: But I'd...

Soren: Yes. You'd forgotten that day in Gallia. But I didn't care. My only wish
    was to see you again. I just wanted to see the only boy who had held out a
    warm hand when I had nothing.

Ike: Soren... Don't cry.

Soren: Don't cry? What? I'm not crying...

Ike: Soren, you're smart, but you're no good when it comes to your emotions.
    Come over here.

Soren: D-don't treat me like I'm a child! I'm not that--

Ike: Come on.

Soren: Shut up! Shut up...

Ike: Then I'll come over to you.

[he moves over]

Ike: It's all in the past, Soren...

Soren: ...Sniff... Sniff... Gwuh... Wahhhhhhhh! Ahhhhhhh!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------{start battle}--

[Sephiran walks in from the side]

Lehran: Forgive me, goddess. I must end my service to you now. My dear goddess,
    Ashera. Please forgive me!

Ashera: Lehran...

Lehran: Everything I've done was a mistake. This is all a result of my
    weakness. The changes were unbearable to watch, too frightening to
    understand. It grew painful to accept change, and with that my heart filled
    with cowardice. I was overwhelmed by the pain, and could think of nothing
    but soothing it. As long as I suffered, I was blind to anything else, even
    to the beautiful things of the world. I can see it now... The people
    deserve compassion. They deserve to have their lives back!

Ashera: No. You were always too flexible, too inconstant. You cannot sway me
    any further.

Lehran: Ashera... My goddess... Please.

Ashera: Be silent now and watch as I erase these things that confuse your
    simple heart.

Lehran: ...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yune: Everyone, listen carefully. In order to reach Ashera, we must first
    destroy the aura protecting her. Got it? Attack the aura.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[for the following line, Ashera attacks in one of several ways: with area of
    effect magical or physical attacks which forms a purple sigil under the
    entire stage, or long-distance magical or physical attacks which target an
    individual allied unit]

Ashera: You would face me in battle? I need no further evidence of your kind's
    imperfections. This will hardly be a battle at all. Simply an end. Perish,
    flawed one.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[upon destroying all of the Auroras]

Micaiah: The aura is gone.

Ike: Excellent. Now we can finish this.

Ashera: ...

----------------------------------------------------{talk; Kurthnaga, Lehran}--

Kurthnaga: You're Lehran...

Lehran: Prince Kurthnaga... How you've grown.

Kurthnaga: You know who I am?

Lehran: I resided in Goldoa for more than seven hundred years.

Kurthnaga: I... I had no idea.

Lehran: That's because I was kept in hiding. But I did meet you several times,
    when you were just an infant.

Kurthnaga: I remember a...a mysterious man with black wings. Was that you? I
    always thought it was a dream...

Lehran: ...

Kurthnaga: I was always so fascinated by that man and his songs... I remember
    him well, and fondly.

-------------------------------------------------------{talk; Sanaki, Lehran}--

Sanaki: You finally made it, Sephiran.

Lehran: Sanaki, I...

Sanaki: I was starting to wonder how I would punish you.

Lehran: I'm sorry?

Sanaki: You are my subordinate, after all. I have decided that leaving one's
    empress to die is punishable by drowning in a pool of rancid butter.

Lehran: Of course it is, my empress.

Sanaki: I hope you're a strong swimmer.

------------------------------------------------------{talk; Micaiah, Lehran}--

Micaiah: Um...

Lehran: Yes?

Micaiah: You're Lehran, aren't you?

Lehran: Yes.

Micaiah: You... Forgive me for asking, but... Aren't you my--

Lehran: Can we talk about this later?

Micaiah: What? Oh, I mean, of course... Sorry to bother you...

Lehran: Child, you couldn't possibly bother me. It's just, the talk you and I
    must have is going to take a long time. I don't think Ashera would wait for
    us to finish.

Micaiah: Oh... Very well.

Lehran: What is it?

Micaiah: Oh, nothing... Never mind. [leaves]

Lehran: Micaiah?

Micaiah: Y-yes?

Lehran: Looks like you could use some backup. I'm good with a staff, too, you
    know.

Micaiah: Th-thank you.

----------------------------------------------------------{talk; Ike, Lehran}--

Ike: Sephiran... I mean, Lehran...

Lehran: I can't apologize enough. I was so terribly mistaken, and now there's
    nothing I can do to help.

Ike: Don't worry.

Lehran: What?
z
Ike: Wanting to do something that matters is enough. Sometimes, how you feel is
    more important than how you act.

Lehran: Ike, I... There's no one that I think more highly of...

Ike: No time for compliments. We still have work to do here.

Lehran: Yes... Yes, we do.

[Ike leaves]

Lehran: Head up! Eyes forward! I will not back down! Altina... Give me
    strength!

----------------------------------------------------------------{boss battle}--

[if Ashera is defeated by someone other than Ike]

Ashera: ...

Ike: It's over. It's all over...

Micaiah: We did it. Our fighting is finally done. Now the people...

Ike: Now the people should all turn back to normal.

Micaiah: Yes!

Ike: Let's get out of here. I'm sure the others are getting tired of waiting
    for us outside.

Yune: Wait!

Ike: Huh?!

[a blue sphere of light forms around Ashera, who fully revives]

Ashera: ...

Ike: What... What's going on? This is insane! We defeated her...

Ashera: You defeated nothing. This is nothing at all out of the ordinary.
    Mortals cannot defeat the divine. It is not possible.

Micaiah: But... We won... General Ike... We have to fight one more time! The
    people out there need our help!

Ashera: You can try as many times as you like. The result will always be the
    same. There is no way for you to win.

Micaiah: I can't believe that! General Ike, you can do it! Forge a new destiny
    for us! Ike, please... You've got to!

Ike: I don't need encouragement. I'd fight to the end no matter what. Ashera,
    you can't stop me. It doesn't matter if you're a goddess. It doesn't matter
    if I have no way to win. Fighting defines me, and I will not lose.

Ashera: When will you tiresome gnats surrender?
