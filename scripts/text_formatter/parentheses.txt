Elise: Come on—hurry up!
(Camilla walks in and Corrin runs towards her and falls to the ground, unintentionally letting go of Elise's hand as a result)

Camilla: Oh! Let me help. [helps Corrin to stand up]
Leo: Did you oversleep again? Better hurry up then.
(Leo opens the door to the Throne Room. After that, the royal siblings walks towards Xander, who is standing near the throne)

Xander: [turns to see his siblings] You’re just in time. [walks towards them] You’ve always had a gift for that. No doubt you always will.
Camilla: (chuckles affectionately)
Leo: (grunts)
Elise: (giggles)
Xander: [smiles before becoming determined and serious as he turns to the throne; the camera slowly goes down to the view of the throne] There was no sense in this war, only madness and greed.
(The camera shows the royal siblings looking at the throne)

Xander: War is monstrous. We are told to make war to support our country. But…it’s a lie. [the camera briefly shows the throne] Told by those who profit from bloodshed. In my reign as Nohr’s new king, I vow to seek peace and understanding.
(The royal siblings looks at Corrin whom Elise grabs his/her hand and moves him/her closer to the siblings)

Xander: [holds his hand to Corrin] With you to guide my hand.
