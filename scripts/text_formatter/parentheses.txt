Lissa: Chrom, we have to do SOMETHING.
(The black splits in the middle - the player is seeing the cut scene from Robin's perspective. They can make out two shadows: one apparently male, the other female.)

Chrom: What do you propose we do?
Lissa: Uh... Uh, I don't know!...
(Robin's eyes open completely, and the figures of Chrom and Lissa come into focus. They realize that Robin has awoken.)

Chrom: I see you're awake now.
Lissa: Hey there!
Chrom: There are better places to take a nap than on the ground, you know. [holds his hand out to Robin] Give me your hand.
(Robin obliges and grasps Chrom's hand. As Chrom pulls them up, it can be seen the mark on the back of Robin's hand is gone.)

Chrom: Welcome back. It's over now.
