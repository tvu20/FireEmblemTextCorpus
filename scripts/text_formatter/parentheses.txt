Eirika:
“Lyon!”

Lyon:
“… Eirika…”

Eirika:
“Lyon… It is you, isn’t it, Lyon…!”

Lyon:
“Yes… But I’m… I’m almost completely gone. Before I’m lost entirely, I want to apologize. I’m sorry, Eirika. This is all my fault. I was too weak…”

Eirika:
“You’re not to blame, Lyon. It was the Demon King. He was controlling you…”

Lyon:
“No, that’s not true, Eirika. When the Demon King reached into me from inside the Dark Stone…When he whispered he would see all my dreams and desires made true…I…I did not reject him. In the shadows of my heart, he saw jealousy…vanity…It was my weakness that put these emotions there, allowed them to thrive.”

Eirika:
“Everyone has weaknesses, Lyon. You’re not the only one. I do. I’m sure my brother does…Don’t hate yourself for having these feelings, please.”

Lyon:
“Thank you, Eirika. You were always…so kind. The Demon King will claim my flesh as a vessel for his resurrection. Before that can happen…I want you to kill me. I’m sorry, Eirika. I’m already-“

Eirika:
…..

(Light dims slightly, Lyon’s speech bubble becomes black)

Evil Lyon:
“Oh, please…Are you done turning your failings into some sad epic of personal tragedy… It’s time we started then. I have a ritual to complete…and some nuisances to kill.”

Eirika:
“Shut your mouth. I won’t allow you to desecrate Lyon’s body any further. You will not return to this world. I will stop you myself if I must.”

Evil Lyon:
“Ah, is that so… And do you honestly think yourself capable, wench… You once prayed for this fool’s salvation. Can you bring yourself to kill him…”

Eirika:
“I can and I will. I made a promise to Lyon, and I intend to honor it.”
