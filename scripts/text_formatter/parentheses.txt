Nemesis: You are a foolish child.
Claude: Tough talk from a guy who's lived too long. Allow me to fix that!
(Nemesis silently stares at the two. Suddenly, he attacks them by using his sword as a whip. Byleth and Claude dodge the attack and then Byleth rushes at Nemesis, clashing swords with him, which is interrupted by Claude shooting another arrow at Nemesis which misses as Byleth dodges a swing from Nemesis's sword.)

Nemesis: You are all pathetic weaklings! You lack the courage to challenge me in lone combat.
(Scene transitions to Claude charging up an arrow from his bow)

Claude: Yet we have the strength to scale the walls between us, to reach our hands in friendship, so we can open our true hearts to one another! (Claude fires an arrow into the air)
Claude: That's how we win!
(Claude charges at Nemesis with a war cry, but gets knocked down. As he attempts to strike Claude, Nemesis is intercepted by Byleth, who charges with the Sword of the Creator glowing. Nemesis, in turn, charges at Byleth with the Dark Creator Sword glowing. The scene transitions to Claude, still on the ground, watching with a smile on his face. As his sword is about to clash with Byleth’s, the arrow Claude fired earlier reappears and pierces Nemesis’ arm. Byleth uses their sword to slash Nemesis across the chest as the Dark Creator Sword is broken into pieces. Nemesis falls to the ground dead. As Byleth stares down at his body, the Alliance army soldiers begin to cheer over the victory. Meanwhile, the remaining members of Nemesis’ army disintegrates as Byleth looks at their sword as it fades. Claude then gets up from the ground with a smile on his face, as Byleth sheaths their sword.)

Claude: Future historians will refer to this day as the new dawn of Fódlan. Of that, I have no doubt.
(Byleth turns around, smiling as they reach their hand out to Claude)

Claude: It's up to you now Teach. As for my path...
