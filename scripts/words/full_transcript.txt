@Opening 
The Kingdom Army meets with Rodrigue in Ailell, the Valley of Torment. With the strength of House Fraldarius on their side, the time to invade the Empire is finally at hand.

@Dialogue 
Rodrigue: Even though it's in ruins, in some strange way, this monastery never truly changes, does it? I studied at the Officers Academy when I was young. Those memories come rushing back whenever I return. What are you doing at this hour, anyway?
Byleth: I couldn't sleep.
Rodrigue:  It's the same for me.
Byleth: Nothing.
Rodrigue: I see.
Rodrigue: Perhaps you'll allow me to join you...
Rodrigue: . I keep recalling my eldest son... He was quite gifted. In fact, he was appointed a knight at the age of 15. I still vividly remember the day he was granted a sword from His Majesty...
Byleth: Your son... Isn't he...
Rodrigue: Dead. He was killed nine years ago in Duscur. All that returned of him that day were his sword and his armor... After it happened, I said something horrible to Felix. He's hated me ever since...and I don't blame him. No matter how much you grieve, the dead will never return. No magic in the world can bring them back. That's why their memory clings to the living like a curse. The more they were loved, the tighter their hold, and the more suffering they cause... I fear I am not a strong enough man to scold His Highness for his foolishness.
Byleth: Someone must.
Rodrigue: Right you are... As adults, it is our responsibility to scold him and help him find his way again, but really... I'm just a failure of a man. 
Byleth: I know how you feel...
Rodrigue: Since this war began, we've seen countless generals, soldiers, and citizens die. It never gets easier. 
Rodrigue: Professor... I entrust the young prince, and the future of Faerghus, to you.
Byleth: This is unexpected...
Rodrigue: I suppose that was a dramatic way of putting it. My apologies.
Byleth: I won't let you down.
Rodrigue: You're a brave one, aren't you? One worthy of leading the Church of Seiros, I daresay.
Rodrigue: You should know that I have no intention of insisting that you take back Fhirdiad. All I ask is that you continue to rein in Dimitri's manic desire for revenge. Now then... we have received House Riegan's consent. All that's left is for us to depart. If we make it through Gloucester Territory and across the Great Bridge of Myrddin, we'll be in Empire territory. You are not afraid, are you?
Byleth: A little.
Rodrigue: Ha! No need to worry. Don't you underestimate the power of my soldiers.
Byleth: I don't feel anything.
Rodrigue: Yes.Such is war...
Rodrigue: I'm glad you were the one to lead the Blue Lion House, Professor. I mean that...

@Conversation 
Dimitri: If you stand in my way, I will strike you down.



Felix: Leaving the house in my uncle's hands? What is the old man thinking? I always knew my father was mad, but this time he's gone too far.
Byleth: I agree. 
Felix: My uncle is a reliable man. But still.
Byleth: I'm actually grateful to him.
Felix: Easy for you to say. You hardly know the man.
Felix: Only a fool would abandon his own territory.



Ashe: The area around Castle Gaspard, where I was living, is under the control of House Rowe, who have submitted to the Empire. If I hadn't come to Garreg Mach, I might have ended up as your enemy at Ailell. That thought makes me really happy to be here now. I don't think I would have been able to handle facing all of you in battle.



Sylvain: I had an encounter with Lord Gwendal... How many years ago was it? Back before the academy, I met this girl who I fell madly in love with...and her dad tried to kill me. I suppose he just tried to scare me, but I was sure I was gonna die. Oh yeah, her dad? Lord Gwendal. Crazy, right? I never thought I'd seriously be trying to kill the guy in battle. I kind of don't know how to make sense of it.



Mercedes: It looks like we're all set with food supplies, thanks to Lord Rodrigue! We have more soldiers to feed now, so we'll still need to ration... But I think we have enough extra to make some tasty treats! I'll go scout the pantry.
Byleth: That would be wonderful. 
Mercedes: We can enjoy it together over some tea!
Byleth: We shouldn't be wasteful...
Mercedes: That's true, but it's important to indulge every now and again. It's been so difficult lately and everyone is worn out. We won't be able to go on if we don't treat ourselves!

Annette: Next we face the Great Bridge of Myrddin... We actually crossed it a long time ago. Do you remember? It was five whole years ago!
Byleth: During the Battle of the Eagle and Lion? 
Annette: It seems like so long ago, doesn't it? It's odd how fast time flies...
Byleth: When we went to Remire Village?
Annette: What are you talking about, Professor? It was on the way to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion!
Annette: Everyone was still friends then. After the fighting, we all ate together without splitting into our separate houses. I often wish we could go back to those peaceful days...



Ingrid: Just like House Fraldarius, House Galatea is currently being invaded by the Dukedom. My family is not as wealthy as most others, so we are incapable of sparing resources or reinforcements. I'm sorry. It's just so frustrating, not being able to do anything to help.



Ferdinand: What used to be Aegir territory lies far to the east of the Great Bridge of Myrddin, downstream of the Airmid River. For the sake of my family, I wish we could invade the Empire from there. But I do not have the power to advocate for that. Strategically, Myrddin is more important.
Byleth: Someday, we'll take it back. 
Ferdinand: Thank you, Professor. I will not give in. Not until I have restored my noble pride!
Byleth: Taking it back would be difficult.
Ferdinand: Yes, I know it would be difficult, but I will not give in!



Linhardt: Since I'm originally from the Empire, it seems no one trusts me with any important tasks. Fine by me. Honestly, I'd bet they're watching my every move to make sure I can be trusted.
Byleth: I'm sure they're not...
Linhardt: If I were in charge, it's what I would do.
Byleth: Probably. 
Linhardt: I knew it. War makes people crazy, huh?



Caspar: The Airmid River separates the Empire and Alliance. It's the largest river in FÃ³dlan. Sometimes it'll flood when there's lots of rain, but... At least the land gets some extra water!

Bernadetta: War isn't kind to you if you're a recluse. By the time you realize what's going on, you're already under attack. And if you're off by yourself, you can get killed with no one ever finding out.
Byleth: Sounds like you're learning.
Byleth: I highly doubt that would happen. 
Bernadetta: Oh, that'd be awful--just terrible! OK, Professor, I get it. I know I'll have to come out.



Dorothea: We're going to invade the Empire...which means we'll be fighting people we know, won't we? If we're attacked by someone we know, or used to think of as a friend, is it permitted to run away?
Byleth: No, it's not OK.
Dorothea: Makes sense. A commander running away would be terrible for morale.
Byleth: I wouldn't blame you. 
Dorothea: Really? If something happens, will you keep me safe?



Petra: If we can suppress this Myrddin, we can invade into the Empire. Right? I was in the Empire. Now I will be an enemy... I am having strange feelings. It is with ease that an ally turns into an enemy.



Raphael: I finally got to eat a full meal for the first time in forever, and it's all thanks to Lord Rodrigue! I've got so much energy! Let me at that Great Bridge of Myrddin! I'll bust it down myself! Oh, but then how do we cross?



Ignatz: The Great Bridge of Myrddin isn't just a bridge. It has the features of a fortress. I believe it was built for military purposes by the first leader of the Adrestian Empire. In other words, it's even older than the monastery. So if we occupy the Great Bridge, we'll have to search it from top to bottom.



Lysithea: I'm sure you know this already, but House Ordelia is aligned with the Empire. They face the Empire from across a river, similar to the Gloucesters. Even so, I refuse to yield to the Empire a second time. The Empire did unthinkable things to my family. And to me. The only option here is winning. Professor, you must promise we will overcome the Empire.



Marianne: My adoptive father is planning on supporting the Riegan family in the upcoming operation. He says it's the perfect opportunity to get both the Alliance and the Kingdom on his side. He even insisted that I promote the good name of House Edmund to the people of the Kingdom.
Byleth: Have you managed to do that?
Marianne: No... I'm not very good at this sort of thing.
Byleth: Do you really need to promote them? 
Marianne: He'll see right through me if I lie, so I can't ignore the request...
Marianne: But I suppose I did just tell you, so that must count for something.



Hilda: Claude says he's on our side. I know everything will be fine if we leave it to him! He may act like a layabout, but he's actually smart. And although Claude isn't honest about some things, you can trust him when it counts.
Byleth: You're not calming my nerves.
Hilda: No, I'm sure it'll be fine! That's just my gut feeling, but still.
Byleth: Yeah, I'm not worried. 
Hilda: Yeah, he'll do us proud! That's just my gut feeling, but still.



Leonie: Lord Rodrigue seems reliable. But even with his help, aren't we still a little shorthanded? We can probably make it to the Great Bridge of Myrddin. But beyond that, I don't know. Don't let Dimitri push you too much, Professor. It'll shorten your life for sure.



Seteth: So, the renowed Shield of Faerghus is now on our side. That is quite reassuring. Not only will he provide valuable support in battle, but he has also brought us much-needed supplies. We cannot grow complacent, however. We must take the Imperial capital as soon as possible.



Flayn: Being here brings back all manner of memories. The days I spent studying here with you and everyone else--those days were so special to me. They truly were some of the warmest days of my life. I hold them dear in my heart. And now, to be forced to fight with those I was once so close to, my friends... It is most saddening.



Hanneman: The battle at Ailell was a tactical marvel. You grow stronger with each passing day. Where does your talent end and your Crest's power begin? Are they one and the same, I wonder? Most intriguing. Yet it is quite difficult to draw useful conclusions, given the situation. It is quite unfortunate I did not achieve my research goals before the war broke out. So much unknown. Now, I fear I will not have those answers even by conflict's end. So very frustrating.



Manuela: Oh, hello there, Professor. Did you need something from me? It doesn't look like you're wounded or anything. You just looking for...someone to talk to?
Byleth: Yes. 
Manuela: I thought so. Well, I'm here for you! Making you feel better is my top priority.
Byleth: No.
Manuela: Come on now, you don't have to be shy. Helping you feel better is important to me.
Manuela: Whether it's physical pain or worries of the heart, you can come to me for anything, Professor.



Gilbert: House Fraldarius is a military house. They swore fealty to the royal family at the Kingdom's founding. The current family head, Lord Rodrigue, was raised like a brother to the former king. He harbors a loyalty that goes beyond mere duty. Perhaps that is why he was willing to lend us his aid.



Alois: I thought House Fraldarius had an invasion of their own to worry about. I'm impressed Lord Rodrigue was willing to provide us all these reinforcements and supplies. The knights' morale is really boosted, seeing as they have had their first good meal in a while. Let's hope we can keep this up, and take down the Great Bridge of Myrddin!



Catherine: Gwendal made the ultimate sacrifice in service of House Rowe. I understand that feeling. I'd do anything for Lady Rhea.
Byleth: But--
Catherine: You think we should have stopped him. You might be right about that.
Byleth: I understand it too. 
Catherine: I'm surprised. I didn't peg you as the kind of person to say that sort of thing.
Catherine: At any rate, it's up to the individual how to demonstrate loyalty.



Shamir: So, House Riegan accepted. I knew the leader of the Alliance wouldn't refuse. Still, we can't let our guard down. There's no telling when he'll turn on us. If we advance through the Alliance into the Empire, our chances for reconnaissance will be limited. I just hope it goes according to plan.



Cyril: Lady Rhea must be so scared. We gotta find her quick as we can. We got reinforcements from the Kingdom people now, right? Then we oughta be able to go save her!



Rodrigue: Even after all these decades, the academy hasn't changed a bit. I remember it well, even now. I used to sneak out of lectures with Lambert almost every day... I suppose this is not the time for an old man's nostalgia. We have received approval from House Riegan. We should set out as soon as you're ready.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Lord Rodrigue is revered by all as the Shield of Faerghus. I was imagining a more stern-faced fellow, but he's actually quite friendly. Shocking! I heard that he recently spent the night drinking in the dining hall with soldiers from the church...

@Intro 
Gilbert: Our scout has returned. As expected, there are quite a few Imperial soldiers stationed there.
Dimitri: I see. So the enemy has prepared for our arrival... It matters not. I will kill them all, whether they are one or one hundred.
Byleth: That's not necessary.
Byleth: Don't say such things...
Dimitri: What would you do, if you saw the people who stole everything from you? If you saw them right before your eyes, living carefree lives and feeling no guilt. Would you feel nothing? Do nothing? Five years ago... Did you not deem the woman who killed Jeralt to be unforgivable? I am most certain that you did. You couldn't let her get away with her crime, so you took up your sword in pursuit.
Byleth: You're wrong.
Dimitri: I think not. We're the same, you and I.
Byleth: You're right.
Dimitri: Precisely my point. We're the same, you and I.
Felix: You're wasting your time. There's nothing to be gained from exchanging words with a boar that has lost its mind.
Gilbert: Felix...
Felix: This is war. Every last one of us has lost someone we care for. But we choose to suppress our anger and go right on living. Do you know why?
Byleth: Because we've given up.
Felix: Revenge can't bring the dead back to life. Unfortunately such a thing isn't possible. Hanging onto your anger, like the boar here, is futile.
Byleth: Because it's pointless.
Felix: That's right. All the boar is accomplishing is stacking up more corpses.
Dimitri: Tell me, Felix... If the dead are beyond reach, is it not also pointless to mourn or even bury those who are lost?
Felix: Ha. That mind of yours. I'm done here. Remember, Professor. It's not compassion for this fool that has brought our army so far. There are those of us who despise the Empire, and those who side with the church. If we keep running down this path, it's only a matter of time before the ground beneath us collapses.
Rodrigue: That's enough, Felix.
Felix: Hmph. You're a damned fool, old man.
Rodrigue: The soldiers are ready to march on your command.
Dimitri: Then let's move out at once. Every moment counts.
Rodrigue: Understood. Let's show those Empire dastards the power of the Knights of Faerghus!

@Opening 
Intent on the Imperial Capital, the Kingdom army goes around the Oghma Mountains and marches through Alliance territory as they continue south. But this route takes them through the territory of House Gloucester--Imperial supporters--so they request help from Claude, the leader of House Riegan. Claude agrees to to distract House Gloucester's soldiers, and the Kingdom army marches onward toward the Great Bridge of Myrddin to cross the Airmid River, which separates the Alliance and the Empire.

After fending off the Empire, your forces decide it's time to advance. But first, you must capture the Great Bridge of Myrddin, a strategic crossing point over the Airmid River, which borders the Alliance and the Empire.

@Battle 
Ladislava: That symbol...it's an enemy raid! Stay calm and face them head-on. Send a messenger to Acheron immediately! If we're quick, we might be able to pull off a pincer attack!
Dimitri: Edelgard's dog, huh? All the more reason to kill her.

Rodrigue: Attack Ladislava and take the bridge. Shall we begin?

Rodrigue: Let's deal with the enemies protecting the fortress quickly, and take control of this area.
Imperial Soldier: Enemies approaching! Get the soldiers standing by to join the fight! We may need to hurry up preparations of the ballista too. Protect the fortress!


Imperial Soldier: You think we'll let you take this bridge form us?
Rodrigue: This is no good... Reinforcements keep coming, and more will soon join them.


Dedue: Your Highness! Apologies for the late arrival.
Dimitri: Dedue... You're alive... How?!
Dedue: We can discuss it later. For now, allow me to join your forces.

Lorenz: I, Lorenz Hellman Gloucester, have arrived to join the battle in my father's stead! 
Alliance General: We'll ally ourselves with the Imperial soldiers too! 
Ladislava: Thanks for making your way here. Annihilate the enemy with the rest of them!
Lorenz: Is that...the professor? Why would someone like that join such a senseless fight?
Ferdinand: Lorenz! Here you are. I am heading south, so I will leave this area to you.


Ladislava: Acheron! Now's the time to show your loyalty to the Empire! Attack the enemy from behind!
Acheron: I've got to make her name known to Her Majesty through distinguished service.
Rodrigue: Acheron, a minor lord of the Alliance territory... If he's fighting for the Empire, we've no choice but to attack him.

@Boss 
Acheron: As they say, if you can't beat them, join them. I'm not in for a beating, am I?

Acheron: Argh... I never should have allied with... the Empire...

Ladislava: To repay Her Majesty's favor...I will not let you pass!

Ladislava: I can't retreat... Even if it costs me my life, I've got to protect the Great Bridge.

Ladislava: Lady Edelgard... I'm sorry...

Ferdinand: Ladislava, no! I will protect this area!

Ferdinand: After this battle, I will be known far and wide as the legendary Ferdinand of Adrestia!

%Byleth,Ferdinand
Ferdinand: Edelgard has always been obsessed with you. I am a little envious, to be frank. I will just have to impress her with my skills on the battlefield!

%Dorothea,Ferdinand
Dorothea: Oh, Ferdie. You opposed Edie for so long... I had real hopes for you, you know? Now you're following her. Is that your duty as a noble? Follow your master when they say to heel?
Ferdinand: I will not try to explain my duty or hers. You would not understand. I wish you could. Anyway, no time for idle chitchat!

@Boss
Ferdinand: Retreat, Ladislava! Tell Her Majesty about this!
Ladislava: We've already sent a messenger! I can't let you die while I flee!
Ferdinand: In that case... Even if I die, you must protect this area.

Ferdinand: Even if I die, please... protect this area.

Lorenz: To oppose the Empire at a time like this would be entirely too reckless.

%Byleth,Lorenz
Lorenz: It's been a while, Professor. If this were anywhere but a battlefield, I would offer you tea. I've no choice but to follow the Empire, if I wish to live. I hope you will not think ill of me.

@Boss
Lorenz: Lay me to rest...in a manner that is befitting...of the nobility...

Lorenz: I yield. Though I will not beg for my life. That would be unbecoming, wouldn't it?

Lorenz: You're inviting me to join you? But...to abandon House Gloucester... No--I can convince my father. I will help you topple the Empire, I swear it!

@End
Dimitri: It's a farce. All of it...

Dimitri: Dedue! Why...How are you here? You died. Five years ago...
Dedue: I was saved by my brothers. Men of Duscur.
Dimitri: Those people you were with... They were of Duscur? And they saved you?
Dedue: Your Highness. I asked that you fulfill your long-held desire, did I not? Allow me to once again act as your sword and shield. Please, let me witness your triumph. I want to behold the moment your wish is finally granted.
Dimitri: Dedue... Of course. And in exchange, I ask that you swear something to me, here and now. Do not ever throw your life away again. Understood?
Dedue: Your Highness... Understood.

Dimitri: Idiots. Embracing death for the sake of that woman. Truly foolish...
Byleth: Aren't you happy we won?
Byleth: What troubles you?
Dimitri: I... I don't know.
Byleth: Do you regret killing them?
Dimitri: They were just beasts with human faces. I had no choice but to kill them, and so I did. That...that is all there is to it.
Rodrigue: It's about time you two returned. We must discuss our next course of action.

Maiden: Please! I need to join you, no matter the cost!
Kingdom General: I'm sorry, but my hands are tied...
Rodrigue: By the goddess! What's with all the commotion?
Maiden: *gasps* 
Rodrigue: What is this girl doing here? This is an army, not an orphanage.
Kingdom General: I believe she's from a nearby village. She keeps insisting that she needs to join our ranks.
Rodrigue: And you thought we could use a child on the front lines? Hurry up and take her back to her parents.
Maiden: My family is gone. I don't have anywhere else to go. Please! I can use magic and I can fight! I can cook, do laundry, anything!
Rodrigue: I'm sure there are plenty of more suitable places to find work. Why are you so fixated on this army, young lady?
Maiden: I need...to get revenge. I must strike down the one who murdered my big brother!
Rodrigue: Your Highness... What should we do?
Dimitri: Let her do as she pleases.
Maiden: Thank you...very much.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
The Kingdom army has captured Fort Merceus. Managing troops from the now-stable western Kingdom and former Alliance territory, the Kingdom army returns to Garreg Mach to regroup and reorganize its forces. With sufficient might to challenge the Empire, the Kingdom army finalizes their plans to march on Enbarr, the Imperial Capital.

@Dialogue 
Gilbert: Ah, there you are. His Highness was looking for you.
Byleth: Where is he?
Gilbert: He's gone ahead, and started interrogating the prisonerâViscount Kleiman's man. He said he'd like for you and I to be present as well. Will you come with me?



Dimitri: I cannot overlook your reckless remarks. Are you really so keen to lose your head?
Prisoner: I only did what I believed was right. I swear to the goddess that I'm not lying. Amidst the turmoil of the tragedy, Lady Patricia was supposed to be the only one who was unharmed. We had been given orders ahead of time to not approach her carriage...
Byleth: Was Patricia an accomplice?
Dimitri: Of course not. What would my stepmother have had to gain from such a...
Gilbert: Perhaps Lady Patricia would have done anything to return to the Empire...to her husband and daughter.
Dimitri: What exactly are you implying?
Gilbert: For the past few months, I've been spying on lords who defected to the Empire in order to investigate rumors about Lady Patricia. Cornelia's words were true. The two of them... I am afraid they conspired together, after all.
Dimitri: Enough of this nonsense. You say she wished to return home? That isn't nearly enough reason to cause such a tragedy.
Gilbert:  I do not intend to imply that the two of them were solely responsible for the whole affair. There were likely nobles who opposed the king, or potentially someone who wanted to throw the Kingdom into chaos. The Empire, and people like Solon and Kronya, had their motives, too.
Dimitri: So my stepmother joined with them to cause the tragedy... Is that what you believe?
Gilbert: Ultimately, this is just conjecture based on the evidence at hand. I have no idea what their true intentions were.
Dimitri: I see. We will hear what this man has to say. For now...
Prisoner: My lord had long felt that King Lambert's radical ways were dangerous. At the time, he was approached with an offer to take part in the incident at Duscur... My lord loves his homeland. To me, he embodied justice. We were only doing what we thought was right.
Dimitri: And so, in the name of justice, he caused massacre upon massacre out of love for his homeland. You murdered your own king, killed our soldiers, and involved innocent citizens. And yet you have the gall to speak of justice?
Prisoner: I am only standing before you now because I could no longer bear the weight of my sins.
Byleth: Did you share those feelings about your homeland?
Prisoner: Yes... I believe I do.
Byleth: Do you regret your actions?
Prisoner: No. I accept your hatred, and even the punishment of death, but I still believe it was a massacre in the name of justice.
Dimitri: Gilbert. Lock this man in his cell.
Gilbert: Are you not...going to kill him?
Dimitri: I will make that decision once I have had time to consider this man's definition of justice.
Gilbert: Yes, Your Highness.


Dimitri: ...
Byleth: Are you OK?
Dimitri: No... I cannot say that I am. Tell me, Professor... How well do you remember your father, Jeralt?
Byleth: Not very well.
Dimitri: I figured as much. Even the memory of those who pass away is taken from those they left behind. Little by little. Year by year.
Byleth: Very well.
Dimitri: Soon enough you will come to understand how painful it is to forget the faces of those who have passed on.
Dimitri: To be honest, I cannot really remember my stepmother's...that woman's smile. Nor the sound of her voice. I always told myself that I would not allow my mind to forget. And yet...all I can recall with clarity is her gazing away, so forlorn. Did my stepmother wish to go home so badly that she would kill Father and me...kill her false family? Home...to her own blood. Her true family.
Byleth: There's no way to know for sure.
Byleth: I don't have those answers.
Dimitri: I suppose it doesn't make any difference now. I am asking you questions you could not possibly know the answer to. I am finished with thoughts like that. I am finally able to go on living without clinging to hate. If I truly treasure those who have died, then I must earnestly atone for my sins. Father, Glenn, all of the soldiers who have fallen... The people of Duscur who still suffer persecution... The only atonement I can offer them now is to take responsibility for this broken Kingdom that has been entrusted to me.
Byleth: That's true.
Byleth: Take responsibility for the Kingdom...
Dimitri: That is why I feel that I must meet with Edelgard and try to talk to her. Do you think it's a fool's errand? Honestly... I think so too. But I must swallow my feelings and grudgesâour whole history, reallyâand ask her about this future that she sees. What she aims for once her domination is complete. What kind of justice she clings to as she fights. And why she felt it necessary to start this war... I believe that asking her these things is the true responsibility I have been tasked with as king.
Byleth: How will you accomplish this?
Dimitri: We will march our troops to the Imperial capital. But before any battle begins, we will set up camp nearby and send a messenger. I will tell her that I need to speak with her in a safe place, without any weapons or troops. As to whether or not she will agree to my request... Well, that rests solely on Edelgard.
Byleth: I'm certain she'll agree.
Dimitri: I would like to believe that as well. You know, Professor... When we fought in Fhirdiad, Cornelia mocked me and called me pitiful. But even if it is true that my stepmother never loved me, I am not to be pitied. After all, I have allies and dear friends who care for me. And now, I also have you by my side.

@Conversation 
Dimitri: Our next battlefield will be the Imperial capital. There will be no turning back. If you have any unfinished business here, you had best settle it before we depart.
Byleth: There's not enough time.
Dimitri: I apologize, but you'll have to make do with the time you have. We cannot afford a delay.
Byleth: Leave it to me.
Dimitri: I knew I could count on you. Good luck.



Dedue: I believe in you, but please ensure that his Highness survives as well. FÃ³dlan's future would be in peril if we lost him. I would not be able to go on.
Byleth: Leave it to me. 
Dedue: Thank you,
Byleth: I understand.
Dedue: Good.



Felix: He intends to speak to the emperor? She's his stepsister, I know, but this seems risky.
Byleth: It's important.
Felix: Pah! I know that!
Byleth: You're against it? 
Felix: No, I'm not. I'm sure he's thought it through.
Felix: If the two can settle this diplomatically, that would be the best way out of this mess. No more bloodshed. Let's just hope he doesn't become so overwhelmed with emotion that he's unable to strike her down... should the need arise.



Ashe: Returning to the monastery brings back so many memories from five years ago. Hard to believe we only spent a year together here. So much happened that it felt a lot longer than that. But it was so exciting. And so much fun. Honestly, I think those memories are what's kept me fighting this long. What was that year like for you, Professor?
Byleth: It was a lot of fun. 
Ashe: I don't think I could ask for a better answer.
Byleth: It was challenging.
Ashe: Ah...yeah, there were a lot of hard times too.
Ashe: Let's all do our best to survive this, so we can come back here when it's all over. I know that's what I'll be doing.



Sylvain: I've been thinking about how we've got our own ideas about justice...and so does the Empire. And what's coming, it's not just a battle between us and them. It's our ideals that are fighting. Whoever wins will say they were right and the other side was wrong. And I get it. That's how it goes... But nobody's willing to talk or compromise, so we'll fight to the death to prove the other guy's wrong. It won't be an easy battle, but let's make sure we come back alive. Right, Professor?



Mercedes: We'll be heading for the capital soon. So much rests on this moment. Will the war really be over if we take the capital?
Byleth: It might not end right away.
Mercedes: You're probably right...but we'll get there eventually.
Byleth: Definitely.
Mercedes: Yay! I'm sure it won't end right away, but that's still great news!
Mercedes: I truly believe that a peaceful future is waiting at the end of all this.



Annette: I hope this is the final battle. Don't you, Professor? When the war is over, everyone will be busy with their own lives... But let's all meet up again someday. Right here at Garreg Mach. You, His Highness, my father, our monastery friends, the knights...everyone!
Byleth: That's a great idea. 
Annette: It was just a silly whim I had, but I really love it!
Byleth: I wonder if that's possible...
Annette: All that matters is whether we choose to make it happen. I really hope that we do!
Annette: Ooh, and I'll bake a bunch of desserts for it! Reunion sweets! All we have to do now is win! Let's get to it, Professor!



Ingrid: I'm so glad you were assigned to the Blue Lion House, Professor. We made it this far thanks to your guidance and leadership. There's a bitter fight ahead - that much is certain. You have my lance.
Byleth: We're counting on you. 
Byleth: We will prevail!
Ingrid: Yes. Let's do this together!



Ferdinand: Professor. At last, the end is nigh. I love the Empire. Part of me wants it to survive. But I know that is not reasonable. The Empire's time has come. The Kingdom is battle-scarred, the Alliance is in tatters... People must be terrified. The world is crumbling around them. What we need now is a mighty leader who can rebuild FÃ³dlan and rule it as a single nation. Nonetheless, it saddens me that we will not have an Adrestian emperor...



Linhardt: When you think of it, as one approaches the end of a war, the sacrifices only grow larger, don't they? The winning side musters their forces and attempts to strike a decisive blow... While those of the losing side make desperate attempts to turn the war in their favor. Neither side will give. I only wish we'd consider those who lose their lives in that struggle.
Byleth: We're far from being safe ourselves. 
Linhardt: Yes, exactly my point. Let's be careful to ensure we don't lose our lives, Professor.
Byleth: It's a necessary sacrifice.
Linhardt: Perhaps, but that doesn't make it any easier to accept your own survival depends on a throw of the dice.
Byleth: It's better than dragging the war out.
Linhardt: I can appreciate that, but just because a choice is better does not mean that it's good.



Caspar: It's such a relief that we've made it this far without having to fight my father.
Byleth: You'll have to face him at some point.
Caspar: Are you trying to scare me? What if he turns up while we're charging the capital?!
Byleth: It sounds like you're scared. 
Caspar: You bet I'm scared! The Imperial army hasn't lost a single battle with my father on the field!
Caspar: But still, I wonder what'll happen to him if we win...

Bernadetta: Professor! My, um, mother might be in the city. I don't have many good memories of her if I'm being honest, but she's dearer to me than my father, If you happen to see her, please make sure she's not caught up in all the fighting. She's only a civil servant, so hopefully she takes a cue from her Bernie and stays inside.



Dorothea: I keep thinking the war is near its end, then it isn't... When can we finally put this dreadful war behind us?
Byleth: Let's end it with the next battle.
Dorothea: That would be wonderful. Imagine, the last moment of combat...then peace. It sounds like a fairy tale. I want to make this a world where there is no fighting, where children can grow up happy and safe.
Byleth: There can be no end to war. 
Dorothea: I suppose you're right... But we should still try to make the world a place where children can grow up happy and safe.



Petra: Five years ago... Edelgard said a thing to me. Brigid is a vassal of the Empire. But she also said I always have the freedom to be choosing whether I am with or not with her. I will become the ruler of Brigid. So she said I must make my own path. So now, my path and her path will be colliding.



Lorenz: At last we've come to the final confrontation! Ruin to the Empire! Glory to Faerghus! Of course, to be perfectly honest, I would have much preferred to march against the Empire at the head of the Alliance. But I suppose I have Claude to thank for denying me that satisfaction, don't I?



Raphael: We're heading up to Enbarr next. I hope I make it back safe so I can tell my little sis about it! I hear they got a neat opera house there where Manuela used to perform. What was it called again?

Byleth: Mitreflanc Opera Company
Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!
Byleth: Mittelfrank Opera Company 
Raphael: Ah, that's the one!
Byleth: Mildewplank Opera Company
Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!
Raphael: My little sis always goes on about how much she'd like to see them perform. I know we can't see a show, but do you think we could at least see the building?



Ignatz: We're about to put the finishing touches on this war. I wonder how FÃ³dlan will look without the backdrop of death and destruction. I can't wait to see it! On the other hand, I'm terrified of what the future might hold. Who knows if I'll survive the assault on the capital?



Lysithea: Wanting so desperately to speak with Edelgard just as we're about to fight... Could it be that the prince is having doubts about killing her.
Byleth: I don't think so.
Lysithea: Then perhaps it is okay.
Byleth: It's only a formality. 
Lysithea: I suppose they're the only ones who fully understand the extent of their relationship.
Lysithea: He's certainly changed from the vengeful person he once was. I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm actually relieved. A king who's responsible for FÃ³dlan's future can't exact personal vendettas and have a cold heart.



Marianne: Dear Goddess...
Byleth: Praying again?
Marianne: Yes... I was praying for your safety.
Byleth: What are you praying for? 
Marianne: Um...for your safety.
Marianne: I'll do all I can to survive, but please...please don't die out there Professor.



Hilda: Fighting in the capital! Ugh! And we're fighting against Edelgard! Double ugh! But with you leading us, Professor, I know we'll win. Yeah! Wahoo! Fighting! I'm a little scared, to be honest. I'm just shouting to relieve the tension, but I'll be fine.



Leonie: At last, it's time to face the Flame Emperor... Edelgard. I know that the future of all FÃ³dlan rests on this battle. Nothing else is more important. But for me, this is personal. For Captain Jeralt's sake, I'm going to give it all I've got and more!



Seteth: Rhea will be somewhere in the city. I wonder if she can sense us coming. The battle will soon be upon us. Let us both be at our best for what is to come.



Flayn: I was born in Enbarr. My mother and father met in the church there. Not too long after, I was brought into the world. I do not understand how war can happen in such a precious place. It is most regrettable.



Hanneman: Enbarr's streets are paved with unhappy memories, Professor. I've avoided the damned place since I abandoned my nobility. Swore never to return. Now here we are. To return in this manner... Well, I can't say it is something I ever imagined. Especially as I'm returning to end the Empire. What a strange feeling, breaking one's history.



Manuela: Life can be tough, you know? But if you've got your friends to help you through, it can be a lot easier. Maybe you butt heads sometimes...but that's OK. That's how you build bonds, right? And I've got friends, Professor. Plenty of those. It's true love that seems to have passed me by.
Byleth: You should relax.
Manuela: Relax? I'm relaxed.
Byleth: There's still hope. 
Manuela: But where is my true love to be found? Where is my ray of hope?
Byleth: Time to give up?
Manuela: Yeah... I'm starting to figure that's the most realistic option.
Manuela: At this point, I'm just hoping you stay single too. Then at least we can share each other's misery!



Gilbert: It matters not how just our cause may be. In the end, war is nothing more than organized murder. I understand the desire to reach a conclusion, but we mustn't overlook the sins inherent in our deeds.
Byleth: I am well aware. 
Byleth: I understand, of course.
Gilbert: Heh, sorry, I have a tendency to preach. We have lost so much, and in return, we have taken much from our enemies. I pray we can put an end to this cycle of violence.



Alois: Here we are, facing the final battle with the Empire. It's been a long, difficult struggle. We have to get Lady Rhea back! And we have to crush the Empire, in the name of Captain Jeralt. He's watching over us now, protecting us. I know he is.



Catherine: Looks like we're nearing the end of this struggle. I'm sure Lady Rhea is on tenterhooks waiting for me to swoop in and rescue her.
Byleth: Probably. 
Catherine:  I was just kidding! Pay me no mind.
Byleth: I doubt it.
Catherine: Oof... You don't mince your words. Try being a bit more mindful of other people's feelings.
Catherine: Lady Rhea is not waiting for me, I know, no matter how much I might wish she were. She's waiting for you.



Shamir: Ten years ago, Dagda and Brigid attacked the Empire from the west. Their final target was the capital. But they were countered at a port town, long before they reached their destination. We spent a lot of time going back and forth, but at least we made it this far.



Cyril: Whenever I think about how we'll be seeing Lady Rhea real soon, I get happy and really get cleaning! We'll get there for sure, right? We'll see her again?
Byleth: We'll meet her for sure. 
Byleth: We don't know for sure.
Cyril: I just gotta believe Lady Rhea is waiting for us in the capital... We just have to find her.



Anna: Seems like the war is gonna end soon. Once the dust settles, it'll be back to rolling in fat stacks of gold for me!

Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Momentum's really picking up for this final battle, huh? Even I'm starting to feel tense! Me! Enbarr's history goes back 1,400 years. That even predates the founding of the Empire. It's one of the sacred sites of the Seiros faith, so it's a pretty big deal. But hey, no need to worry about the monastery while you're fighting the final battle. I've got it covered! I'll defend it to my last!

@Intro 
Dimitri: Professor. Do you think Edelgard will show up?
Byleth: She will.
???: Well, well. It's been a long time, Professor. And hello to you, too, Dimitri.
Byleth: I doubt it.
???: Sorry to disappoint you, Professor.

Dimitri: Edelgard. I did not think you would actually accept my request.
Edelgard: Call it a whim. Well then? What did you want to talk about?
Dimitri: I will get straight to the point. Why did you start this war? There had to be a way to change things in your territory without the need for so many senseless casualties.
Edelgard: It may be hard to believe, but this is the way that leads to the fewest casualties in the end. Don't you see?
Dimitri: How could I? Countless people have already lost their lives in this conflict.
Edelgard: The longer we took to revolt, the more victims this crooked world would have claimed. I weighed the victims of war against the victims of the world as it is now, and I chose the former. I believe that I have chosen the best path, the only path.
Dimitri: Even after seeing the faces of those who have suffered the ravages of war, you would still force them to throw their lives away for the future? You are obsessively devoted to this war and deaf to the screams of its victims. You cannot change the cycle of the strong dominating the weak with a method like that.
Edelgard: You're wrong. That very cycle is exactly what I have devoted my life and my power to destroying. If after all of this you believe the weak will still be weak, that is only because they are too used to relying on others instead of on themselves.
Dimitri: Yes. Perhaps someone as strong as you are can claim something like that. But you cannot force that belief onto others. People aren't as strong as you think they are. There are those who cannot live without their faith...and those who cannot go on once they have lost their reason for living. Your path will not be able to save them. It is the path of the strong, and so, it could only benefit the strong.
Edelgard: Heh, so you consider me strong, do you? Even if one clings to their faith, the goddess will never answer them. Countless souls will be lost that way. Living without purpose. And I can be counted among those who have died that way as well. But that's why I must change this world, on behalf of the silent and weak!
Dimitri: And do you intend to become a goddess yourself? Will you steal the power to take action from the broken-hearted masses you claim to defend? The ones who can truly change the way of the world are not the rulers, but the people. Pushing your own sense of justice and your own ideals onto even one other person is no more than self-righteousness.
Edelgard: Maybe it is self-righteousness, but it doesn't matter. Someone has to take action and put a stop to this world's endless, blood-stained misery!
Dimitri: Do you not believe in the power of people to join together and rise up? Humans are weak creatures. But they are also creatures who help each other, support each other, and together, find the right path. I have learned that humans are capable of all that from the professor...and from everyone in my life.
Edelgard: I doubt a highborn person like yourself could know how the poor feel or what motivates them.
Edelgard: This is nonsense. Thought, I'm finally starting to understand how you feel. But that makes it even clearer to me that we can never fully understand each other.
Dimitri: I feel the same. I finally understand...what you believe is right.
Edelgard: Good-bye, Dimitri.
Dimitri: Wait, Edelgard. There is something I must give you.

Dimitri: This is for you. Use it to cut a path to the future you wish for. And I will rise up to meet you there...El.
Edelgard: ...

@Flashback
Dimitri: El! So it's true... You're really going away? Going back home?
Edelgard: There's nothing I can do about it. It's all happening so fast... I'm as surprised as you are.
Dimitri: El... Um... Here. I want you to have this.
Dimitri: El, listen to me. No matter how hard things get, you can't give in, OK? You've got to cut a path to the future you wish for, no matter what.
Edelgard: It's...a dagger? Why would you give me something like this?
Dimitri: Oh, um... I'm sorry. I couldn't think of anything better to give you.
Lord Arundel: Edelgard! What are you doing? It's time to go. Hurry and get in the carriage.
Edelgard: Oh! I... I'm sorry, Uncle! I have to go now... Good-bye, Dimitri.

@Intro
Edelgard: I...I remember now. You gave me a dagger, all those years ago.
Dimitri: Heh, I'm still sorry about that. I should have given you something that would've made you happier.
Edelgard: Perhaps. At the time, I was quite flustered by such a dangerous gift. I left without giving you a proper response...and that was the last time we saw each other.
Dimitri: True. It is a sweet memory with a bitter ending.
Edelgard: I'm afraid it will do no good to reminisce, Dimitri. That girl you knew back then is gone. As good as dead. But...I'll tell you now what I wasn't able to tell you back then. Thank you. My dear, forgotten friend...because of you, I never lost my heart. As for the future...that will be decided in battle. King of Faerghus. As the emperor, I shall await your arrival in Enbarr.
Dimitri: ...

@Opening 
The Kingdom army, having gathered new troops and significant strength, commences its march towards the Imperial capital of Enbarr. In response to their movements, Emperor Edelgard orders her trusted retainer, Hubert, to the front lines to meet the Kingdom army head-on. The two forces clash in the city streets.

With Fort Merceus conquered, it's time to approach Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Imperial forces stand ready in the city streets, intending to resist to the bitter end.

@Battle 
Dimitri: The gates to the Imperial capital have been broken. All troops, storm in! The emperor is within reach!
Gilbert: The Imperial troops are dug in across the city. Let's cut through them, and carve a route to the palace.

Hubert: Heh. The Savior King arrives, hands red with blood. Let's give him a royal welcome. Artillery, once the enemy is in range, fire at will. Reinforcements will fly in shortly. Keep your focus and hold steady until they arrive.

Dorothea: Reinforcements should be here soon. Let's draw them in... just like we planned. 
Hubert: Draw them toward the opera house. Reinforcements will be here any moment. 

Manuela: Has it really been so long since I was in that opera house? Couldn't have imagined any of this back then.

Dorothea: The battle is nearing the opera house. I hope everyone in the company is safe.

Flayn: That church... It looks familiar. I believe that is where my parents first met.

Seteth: Ahâthat church. I've such memories of that place. From a time before I was Seteth...

Thief: War is for the wealthy. We don't even have enough to eat... I'm sure the goddess won't punish us for a little bit of thievery here and there...

Dimitri: More reinforcements, eh? And this time it looks like a fair number... It would be best if we could take them down from a safe distance... Is there any way we could neutralize the cannons or catapults?

@Boss 
Dorothea: The battle is nearing the opera house. I hope everyone in the company is safe.

Dorothea: Oh, that face brings back some memories. It's a shame we don't have time to catch up.

%Manuela,Dorothea
Dorothea: Manuela? It's not like you to show up anywhere sober. What's the occasion?
Manuela: I thought maybe we could talk. I could help you see the error of your ways. Or we could just try to kill each other over what we believe in. You ready to do this?
Dorothea: No... But let's get to it.

%Byleth,Dorothea
Dorothea: If it's our destiny to kill each other, then I cannotâwill notârespect the goddess. My only request is that if you win, you'll at least have the decency to kill me quickly.

@Boss
Dorothea: Edelgard, forgive me... I can't...
Hubert: So, Dorothea has been defeated. We will need to thin their numbers as well, or else. If House Varley's troops arrive in time, we may be able to flank the Kingdom's army...

Hubert: So, they've stopped our reinforcements. We will need to thin their numbers as well, or else. If House Varley's troops arrive in time, we may be able to flank the Kingdom's army...

Petra: For Adrestia and for Brigid! I will be defeating all of you!

%Byleth,Petra
Petra: Professor... I have been thinking. About why I came to FÃ³dlan. To the Empire. I am here to be protecting Edelgard...and to be stopping you.

%Shamir,Petra
Shamir: I cannot bring myself to kill you... You're a princess of Brigid. A hostage of the Empire.
Petra: That was the truth in the past, but it is a different truth now, Shamir... I am... the will of the emperor!
Shamir: In that case, I won't hold back.

@Boss
Petra: Edelgard... I will not be keeping my promise... Give me forgiveness, please...

Hubert: It's almost a shame to kill you. Not even death will make you consequential.

%Byleth,Hubert
Hubert: I should have disposed of you a long time ago. I will rectify that failure here!

%Ferdinand,Hubert
Hubert: Running into you in the capital like this-I have to say it's almost sentimental.
Ferdinand: Hubert. She must leave.
Hubert: You really think you can make her?
Ferdinand: It does not matter what I think. Those are my orders.

%Dimitri,Hubert
Dimitri: Hubert. I would tell you to get out of my way, but I highly doubt that you would abide.
Hubert: Heh. Your silver tongue will do you no good here. This is not your path to tread.
Dimitri: That is not your decision to make, nor is it mine. All I can do is blaze ahead!

@End 
Hubert: We must place our faith...in Her Majesty... Her victory is everything...
Dimitri: It's over... The way to the palace is clear. Let's move!

Dimitri: Send your platoons to capture Enbarr! There is to be no needless killing or pillaging, understand?
Kingdom General: Yes, Your Highness!

Dimitri: Edelgard awaits us. We will advance our main forces straight to the palace.
Byleth: We've finally made it here.
Byleth: We can win this.
Dimitri: Yes, it has truly been a long war. And we have only made it this far because of you... Actually, no. I will save that sentiment for after we win this battle. We will advance our troops and confront her. We must strike down the emperor and end this war.
Dedue: My life is yours, Your Highness.
Annette: Let's win this and go back home in victory! I'll do the very best I can!
Ingrid: On my honor as a knight...I will not lose!
Mercedes: I know the goddess is watching over us. Let's be sure to return home safely. All of us.
Ashe: As a citizen of Faerghus, I will fight with everything I have!
Sylvain: Heh heh heh, is this what a do-or-die situation looks like? You had best give it your all too, General.
Felix: The path to the emperor is open. Fulfill your duty as our king.

Felix: Go and win. Be the boar you are, and don't you dare look back.
Byleth: Let's go!
Dimitri: Yes. I will... No. We will win this. Together! Everyone! Move out!

Edelgard: The time has nearly come.
Imperial General: Yes, the anomaly should present itself shortly. However...
Edelgard: There's no reason to fret. Besides, it's far too late to second guess. Now, assume your position. I can't promise your safety if you remain here.
Imperial General: Very well. 

Edelgard: Ugh... This pain is nothing...compared to what I have already suffered...
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
It is Imperial Year 1185. Nearly five years have passed since the fall of the monastery at Garreg Mach, and war continues to plague the lands of FÃ³dlan. Fhirdiad has been captured. The Holy Kingdom of Faerghus is in shambles. The Leicester Alliance is on the verge of collapse, fractured by two opposing factionsâthose who support the Adrestian Empire and its ruler, and those who seek her demise. Meanwhile, under Emperor Edelgard's rule of law, the Adrestian Empire continues to expand its reach. The path to a new FÃ³dlan, unified by Imperial strength, may yet be in sight.

@Dialogue
???: You... How long do you intend to sleep? Your body is awake. Your eyes must open now, and you must find the strength to stand upon those legs of yours. Like so much rain, a pool of blood has fallen to the ground... As spears and arrows pierce the earth, it weeps. And even now...it weeps. In order to survive, they kill. And so, the people of this world are lost in an abyss of suffering. They weep as well. The only one who truly knows the nature of such things is I... Or rather, you.
Byleth: I'm still sleepy.
???: You are a complete and utter fool! Have you not changed one bit?!
Byleth: Who?
???: Excuse me?! Are you saying you have forgotten who I am? How dare you!
???: Get on your feet. Right now! I'll coddle you no more! You are just like a child, always needing me to hold your hand...


Villager: Hey! A-are you awake?
Byleth: Where am I?
Villager: Weâre in a village at the base of the monastery. What are you doing in a place like this?
Byleth: Who are you?
Villager: Iâm just a villager here. What are you doing in a place like this?
Villager: I honestly didnât expect to find someone floating away down the river... Garreg Mach is upstream of here, but that place was abandoned.
Byleth: What do you mean?
Villager: Huh? You donât know? The Church of Seiros isnât there anymore. Though there have been some folks still living there in the five years since... Well, you know. Anyway, Iâve heard some thieves have been spotted around those parts these days.
Byleth: Five years.
Byleth: What year is it?
Villager: Um, are you feeling all right? You didnât hit your head or anything did you? Itâs the Ethereal Moon of the year 1185. Itâs been nearly five years since the monastery fell. Tomorrow was supposed to be the millennium festival, but whoâs got time to think about things like that?
Byleth: The millennium festival...
Villager: Uh, yeah, thatâs what I said. But with the war and the archbishop still missing and all... I doubt thereâs a soul to be found who has enough blessings worth counting. Hey! Slow down, will ya? Where do you think youâre going?
Byleth: The monastery.
Villager: Are you crazy?! I told ya! They say thieves are running amok up there, and thereâs plenty of other dangers too. I heard a rumor that Imperial troops went up there to investigate and got slaughtered. Every last one! Come on, I promise I wonât say youâre a coward. Just forget about going anywhere near the monastery.

Villager: You just remember I tried to stop you, got it? Itâs not on my conscience if you wind up dead!
Byleth: My students are waiting for me.
Villager: Students? You really are crazy, arenât you? There arenât any kids anywhere near that place anymore! Unbelievable...
Byleth: No need to worry about me.
Villager: Unbelievable...

@Cutscene 
Dimitri: I should have known...that one day...you would be haunting me as well.

@Dialogue 
Dimitri: You... What must I do to be rid of you? I will kill that woman, I swear it. Do not look upon me with scorn in your eyes!
Byleth: What are you talking about?
Byleth: Everything will be OK.
Dimitri: ... You... It can't be! You're alive?! Hmph. If that is the case... That can only mean you are another Imperial spy. Did you come here to kill me? Answer the question.
Byleth: Of course not.
Dimitri: Ungh...
Byleth: I'm glad you're safe.
Dimitri: Am I?

@Intro 
Dimitri: ...
Byleth: What have you been doing the last five years?
Dimitri: I have been dead, more or less.
Byleth: Why do you say that?
Dimitri: What do you hope to gain, asking me that? There are more important matters at hand...
Byleth: ...
Dimitri: Do you not smell them? Filthy rats. Everywhere. And traces of those who were here long ago. And thieves, crawling from the woodwork, attracted by the promise of treasure. Heh... Since the monastery fell, order in the area fell right along with it. You must have seen the state of the town near Garreg Mach on your way here. Vile thieves run rampant. They pillage and loot to their heartâs content. I must kill them. Every last one. Itâs time to hunt down their nest.
Byleth: What do you plan to do?
Dimitri: I told you. I will kill them all.
Byleth: Even thieves are just trying to survive...
Dimitri: It doesn't matter what their reasons are.
Byleth: We don't have to kill them to stop them.
Dimitri: They must die.
Dimitri: Someone must put a stop to this cycle of the strong trampling the weak. Or do you condone their actions? Do you believe that the pillaging and slaughtering those rats live for is justified?! It is reprehensible, and they must be put down! I intend to give them a taste of the pain they have inflicted on others. Even if it means becoming a rat myself. I swore to at least do that much... I will not let them down...
Byleth: How many thieves are there?
Byleth: Can just the two of us hope to prevail?
Dimitri: It doesn't matter. All that matters is killing those who deserve to die.

Gilbert: Good work. I should have known to check the monastery. Let's move, quickly!
Kingdom soldier: Yes, sir!
Gilbert: Dimitri... I'm on my way.

@Opening 
In the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, Imperialist loyalist Cornelia has subdued all regions of the former royal house of Blaiddyd to prevent further revolt. Prince Dimitri has been sentenced. Now, the backbone of the former KingdomâHouses Gautier and Fraldariusâstruggle to continue the resistance. Corneliaâoperating out of the royal palaceâhas accepted the support of the Empire to build an army and plots to wipe out all remaining Kingdom forces.

In the Leicester Alliance, House Riegan leads an anti-Imperial faction, while House Gloucester directs the Empireâs supporters. Despite the undeniable threat of fracture, the Allianceâs adept new leader, Claude, deftly maintains the outward appearance of a unified front.

In Enbarr, the Imperial Capital of the Adrestian Empire, Emperor Edelgard fights to strengthen her regime. She has extended her reach to the Kingdom by inciting a coup and continues to draw its former lords under her influence in pursuit of controlling all of western FÃ³dlan.

In the meantime, the Knights of Seiros have been dispatched to find Archbishop Rhea, who remains missing despite their searching. Left unattended, the monastery at Garreg Mach has fallen to ruin...and become a haven for thieves.

@Battle 
Dimitri: It smells of blood and sewage. Seems I've found their nest.
PallardÃ³: What the... Intruders! Protect the goods!

Dimitri: Shall we go rat hunting? Don't let a single vermin escape!

Gilbert: His Highness! And... Professor? We must speak later.
Ashe: I know it's been five years, but I never expected the monastery to end up like this.
Mercedes: Oh! I haven't seen any of you in such a long time! I'm so glad to see you're alive.
Annette: We'll help out from here! It's over, thieves!
Dimitri: Why... Why are you here?

Sylvain: The monastery has become a nest of thieves.
Ingrid: Professor! You're alive after all! But first things firstâlet's defeat these thieves.
Felix: I'll lend a hand. We'll catch up later.
Dimitri: Listen up. We must end this quickly.

Dimitri: There are openings to the north and south. We'll split into two and tear them apart.

Ingrid: I'm glad we could meet again, Professor. It'll be nice to fight alongside each other. Just like old times.

%Byleth,Felix
Felix: Fancy meeting you here. A welcome surprise.

@Boss
PallardÃ³: No! I'm not the one you want! Gah! I guess I've got no choice.

PallardÃ³: Ah, you should yield me a tidy profit!

PallardÃ³: I have no longer any reason to be here. Good-bye and be well!
Dimitri: Damn it, we failed to kill him...

PallardÃ³: I thought it would be easy money... Maybe it wasn't...meant to be...
Dimitri: ...

%Dimitri,PallardÃ³
PallardÃ³: It isn't looking good for us. Should we retreat?
Dimitri: You didn't plan on letting him get away, did you?

@End 
Ingrid: Your Highness! Professor! I'm so glad you're both safe...
Dimitri: Why are you here?
Ashe: Did you forget? We all made a promise here on this very day five years ago.
Mercedes: Dimitri, weren't you the one who asked that we all meet up here?
Annette: Don't be silly! Of course you remember our promise. That's why you and the professor are here, right?
Gilbert: Your Highness... I have been following news of your whereabouts for a while now. I am relieved to have finally found you.
Dimitri: Do not call me that. I am not a prince, but a walking corpse.
Byleth: Why would you say that?
Gilbert: That is what we all believed, but it is not so. I can see with my own eyes that you are alive, Your Highness. But the jail cells in Fhirdiad are as solid as they come. How did you manage to...
Dimitri: Dedue.
Byleth: What happened?
Dimitri: He's dead. He died in my place.
Gilbert: I see. We will be sure to honor his loyalty, Your Highness. As for the state of the Kingdom, the lords from the western regions have declared their fealty to the Empire, starting with House Rowe. Corneliaâs band of traitors now refers to Kingdom territory as the Faerghus Dukedom. Theyâve made Fhirdiad their stronghold as they continue to invade the eastern region.
Byleth: Traitors?
Gilbert: There is much to tell you. I will explain everything in time.
Byleth: Cornelia?
Gilbert: She is a mage who has served in the royal family for more than 20 years. There is much to tell you. I will explain everything in time.
Sylvain: Well, itâs not like all of the Kingdomâs lords have sided with the Empire. There are plenty of houses, like mine and Felixâs, that remain stubbornly opposed.
Gilbert: Your Highness. Please allow us to take up arms at your side once more. What we need more than anything isnât soldiers, money or supplies. We need the legitimate heir of Faerghus to overthrow the Empire and reclaim the Kingdom! Such is your duty. It is yours alone to bear and well worth fighting for. Only you can gather our troops and lead us back into the light.
Byleth: You are still needed, Dimitri.
Dimitri: I see. So, you all agree that we must fight back. And you see how that woman...how the Empire cannot be forgiven. That we must wipe them all out until not a single one of them remains...
Annette: Wipe them all out? Umm, I donât think any of us here are suggesting anything that extreme...
Gilbert: ... Professor... There is something I would like to ask you. Please join me inside the monastery.

Gilbert: To think you survived under all that rubble for the past five years... I suppose stranger things have happened, odd as that is to admit. There is still much I would like to ask you... But I think that's enough for now.
Byleth: Is Rhea safe?
Byleth: Where are the Knights of Seiros?
Gilbert: On that day five years ago, during the battle with the Imperial army, Lady Rhea went missing. Since then, the Knights of Seiros have continued searching for her...and for you. I hear they have yet to find any promising leads. As the Empire has yet to release a statement, itâs hard to imagine that she has perished. And yet... Ah, never mind. Once news of your survival gets out, everyone will flock back to the monastery.
Byleth: What happened to the Kingdom?
Gilbert: After that battle, a certain...incident took place in Fhirdiad. Rufus, who was serving as king regent, was murdered. I was once a knight in service of the royal family... I resigned from the Knights of Seiros, and returned to serve the Kingdom. However...


Gilbert: This is madness! You truly claim that His Highness is the one who killed Rufus?
Cornelia: Oh, but itâs true. The only one who could slip past the bodyguards and kill so efficiently is the young prince. You canât deny it.
Gilbert: Rufus is Prince Dimitriâs uncle! His Highness is incapable of such an atrocious crime as murdering his own blood!
Cornelia: Ah, but they were never very close, were they? Itâs a well-known fact amongst former retainers. There are even rumors that Rufus was originally involved in the Tragedy of Duscur... Perhaps His Highness believed those rumors and murdered Rufus in a fit of rage. But Iâm afraid none of that matters now.
Gilbert: Cornelia. Do not tell me that you...
Cornelia: The decision has been made. His Highness will pay for his crime with his head. His sentence will be carried out the day after tomorrow. On that day, the royal bloodline will come to an end. All you have left to do is sit back and watch, you senile old fool. Watch as the Kingdom you love falls to ashes.

Gilbert: It was soon after announced that his sentence had been carried out. With His Highnessâs death, the royal bloodline of House Blaiddyd was erased from this world. True to her word, all we could do was watch as she tore the Kingdom apart before our eyes. Since the execution and the princeâs corpse were concealed from the public, there have always been those who believed His Highness was still alive... As for myself, I only began to hope three years ago, when I chanced upon some compelling rumors...
Byleth: What rumors?
Gilbert: An Imperial platoon attacked without warning. Incident after incident of Imperial generals being slaughtered in Kingdom territory. It is said that each died in such a brutal, gruesome way that...it is hard to imagine they were killed by human hands. 
Gilbert: I followed the rumors to location after location. Eventually, I had seen enough. I knew the rumors were true. Finally, after a half decade of torment, it happened. I found him... 
Gilbert: I fear his deep hatred, and the weight of his solitude, have consumed him for far too long... We must bring him back from the edge on which he stands. 
Gilbert: To that end, I must speak with His Highness. I imagine it will not be a quick or easy conversation. I pray that he is of a mind to speak of such things. I am certain that my words will... Never mind. What must be done, must be done. I would wager that you are weary after the dayâs events. Perhaps you should take this opportunity to get some rest.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
When Claude steps down as its leader, the Leicester Alliance disbands and its lords swear fealty to the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus. The chaos in the Kingdom begins to dissipate as the people unite under Dimitri's rule. Riding this momentum, the Kingdom army prepares to march south for a decisive battle against Imperial forces.

@Dialogue 
Dimitri: We will finally have our decisive battle with the Empire this month.
Gilbert: The eastern lords are in the process of consolidating all of the troops within the entire Kingdom.
Gilbert: In addition, ever since Arianrhod's liberation, the western lords have been declaring their fealty one after another.
Ashe: Affairs within the Kingdom have calmed down considerably, and we even managed to win over the Alliance.
Annette: Although it was a rough go at first, I'm starting to feel like we could actually win this!
Mercedes: That's true! Thinking back on it now, we've really come a long way.
Seteth: We even have a lead to where Rhea is located. It is as we predicted all along. If we are to rescue Rhea, then we must defeat the emperor...
Ashe: Um, if we're going to march from the monastery to Enbarr, then we'll have to cross the Great Bridge of Myrddin again, right?
Dimitri: Yes, I believe so. As we have gained the Alliance's support, we should not have any trouble this time. After the bridge, we can head across Gronder Field and head south. And then we'll take Merceus, the so-called impregnable fortress that towers on the other side.
Byleth: An impregnable fortress?
Ashe: Fort Merceus... I know of it. They say it rivals even Arianrhod.
Gilbert:  Fort Merceus is praised as the strongest defense in the Empire. 
Gilbert: Count Bergliez, the Empire's minister of military affairs, once had troops stationed there. But according to our spies, a large scale force has entered the stronghold. Perhaps they are gathering soldiers from various regions to compensate for their losses.
Byleth: Should we try to avoid it?
Dimitri: If we try to avoid it, those troops will follow us and attack from the rear. It is best for us to handle the situation head-on.
Byleth: Can we really prevail?
Dimitri: It is unlike you to worry so. But I feel we have no choice but to strip that place of its impregnable reputation.
Dimitri: Once we take Fort Merceus, Enbarr will be within reach. This is the Empire's last chance to stop us from arriving at our goal.
Sylvain: In other words, if we take this fort, then our blades will at the emperor's throat in no time.
Ashe: If this is the last fort between us and them, then the emperor will likely do everything she can to strengthen its defenses.
Dimitri: I just received a report on that very subject. The one commanding the troops stationed at Fort Merceus is someone we have crossed blades with many times. It is the Death Knight who awaits us there.
Mercedes: Oh... So that's who we'll be battling... Emile...

@Conversation 
Dimitri: From this point onward, we're in all-out war with the Empire. Are you prepared, Professor?
Byleth: I am.
Dimitri: I am glad to hear it. That means we can approach the coming battles with peace of mind.
Byleth: Are you?
Dimitri: I have already steeled myself as best I can.
Dimitri: First we capture Fort Merceus. The fighting will be undoubtedly be brutal, but... we must prevail. As far as this army and I are concerned, you're our last ray of hope. We are relying on you.



Dedue: Claude has stepped down from leadership, and Leicester is now a vassal state of Faerghus. The lords of the western Kingdom are beginning to declare fealty to us in greater numbers also. The Empire is our only remaining enemy.



Felix: We defeated Lord Arundel. The emperor must have been surprised. If we can keep up that fervor, perhaps we'll capture Fort Merceus, and move on to the Imperial capital. We must not be overconfident though.
Byleth: We're going to win
Felix: You're optimistic.
Byleth: Let's proceed with caution. 
Felix: Yes, I concur.
Felix: Human and beasts are ultimately the same. When they're cornered, they lash out however they can. They fight for their lives. Who knows how the emperor will lash out? We have to be careful.



Ashe: I wonder where Claude will go. From the sound of it, he's leaving FÃ³dlan altogether. He was strangely gallant about the whole thing. Even left his Relic behind. Elusive and mysterious to the end, isn't he?



Sylvain: Ya know Professor, laying a siege to a keep is like asking a girl out on a date. First, you get past her defenses...then you make your move.
Byleth: That's not the best analogy.
Sylvain: Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. I'm a seasoned veteran at this kind of thing. Girls, I mean. I've never actually, you know, captured any keeps...
Byleth: You might be right. 
Sylvain: See? You get it. Our fearless leader on the other hand... He's never been good with the ladies.
Sylvain: Anyway, I figure you go after the main gate. You take that out and I'm sure we can win. Of course, you're making the tactical calls. I'm happier to follow than to lead.



Mercedes: Death Knight... Going to fight the Death Knight...
Byleth: You seem concerned. 
Mercedes: Hmm... To be perfectly honest, I am...
Byleth: You'll be fine if you prepare yourself.
Mercedes: You're right. I'll have to face him eventually.



Annette: Oh, Professor! Good timing. You have to talk some sense into my father! Recently he's been doing nothing but work himself to the bone. Even when he's taking breaks from training and errands, he's apparently listening to reports. Day in and day out. He's getting on in years, you know? I just want him to take care of himself...



Ingrid: Just as we suspected, Lady Rhea was taken to the Imperial capital. We must get to the capital as quickly as possible. So many people are worried sick about her... I do wonder when Claude managed to learn Lady Rhea's whereabouts. He's pretty shrewd. I can't help but admire him.



Ferdinand: The majority is with us. This conflict will end soon. I am so moved by the decision that Claude and the Alliance nobles have made. That is true nobility! Acting in accordance with the people's needs and wishes. As war drags on, those living near the front lines inevitably get the worse of it. Still...Edelgard will not give in. She will push to complete her mission, no matter how many people die. Not everyone with noble blood has noble ideals.



Linhardt: Attacking an impregnable fortress head-on is rather impressive... or suicidal. Depends on the day really. You know Fort Merceus's nickname, I assume. The Stubborn Old General? It may be stubborn, but its age means it's got to be hiding a few weak spots. Makes sense to aim for those areas.



Caspar: Fort Merceus is next, huh? Ah, the memories. It's a huge stronghold in my father's domain. The town's completely surrounded by high walls. I used to run around there when I was a kid... Way back when the fortress was just a playground for me. Yeah, those were the days.

Bernadetta: I love a good fortress - the perfect place to hide! This one's impregnable too, isn't it? Perfect! As soon as we take it, I'll set up a special spot for Bernie!
Byleth: If we can take it, it's not impregnable.
Bernadetta: I guess you have a point. What would you call it, then? A little pregnable?
Byleth: It's too big to make a good hiding place. 
Bernadetta: Now that you mention it, I guess it is pretty huge.,,



Dorothea: The Leicester Alliance is no more. Three hundred years of history...gone and done. They write operas about events like this, you know.

Dorothea: I'm sure they'll have a talented and beautiful songstress playing you. And with Dimitri at your side... Well, they'll probably contrive some kind of romance to keep things interesting.

Dorothea: Dimitri will be played by the most handsome actor of the time. Hearts will pound as he takes the stage. What am I saying? Surely the most handsome man would play you.



Petra: I have excitement in my heart for secret tactics! I enjoy attacks that are surprising. I thought we could be using attacks like that at this fortress. But I am hearing a different thing. A brute force attack with all of our power, yes? Attacks that are surprising are also safer. Attacking from the front has... is dangerous. But I will give you all of my fighting spirit, Professor.



Lorenz: It appears that Claude has dissolved the Alliance. He's thrown away the pride of all the Leicester lords who have walked the path of independence from Faerghus for generations! I said from the start that he was not suitable to lead!
Byleth: Uh-huh... 
Byleth: But even you...
Lorenz: ... 
Lorenz: Well, times have changed, haven't they? I suppose we can trust the Kingdom now.



Raphael: Wake up, eat, train, eat, train, eat, sleep. We gotta prepare for the assault, but that hasn't changed my routine!
Byleth: You're doing plenty. 
Byleth: Can't you do more?
Raphael: All the training...and eating...I do is for the sake of FÃ³dlan! Gotta stay strong...and fed...to keep it safe!



Ignatz: My family made it through the conflict unscathed. Thank the goddess! It seems that Derdriu was the only place to really get caught up in the fighting. Did Claude intend to spare the Alliance territories from harm? If so, he's a truly admirable leader. Speaking of Claude, I wonder where he is?



Lysithea: Something about Lord Arundel rubbed me the wrong way. There was something off about him. Not that I've ever heard anything good about him. Have you ever heard of the Hrym family?
Byleth: From the Alliance?
Lysithea: No, they're an Imperial house. Their territory is south of Ordelia's.
Byleth: From the Empire? 
Lysithea: Correct. Their lands are due south of the Ordelia territory.
Byleth: From the Kingdom?
Lysithea: No, they're an Imperial house. Their territory is south of Ordelia's.
Lysithea: Since Edelgard's rule, Lord Arundel has been governing the territory. It seems like his reign was particularly cruel. The people there suffered greatly under him. He seemed to be a good and just person at one point. It simply doesn't make sense.



Marianne: Now that the Alliance has been dissolved, what will become of the nobility?
Byleth: I'm not sure.
Byleth: Are you worried? 
Marianne: No, my adoptive father knows how to get by. I'm sure he'll do well for himself in the Kingdom.
Marianne: All of FÃ³dlan is going to change... I suppose I'll have to change with it.



Hilda: The Alliance dissolved so suddenly. Now there's widespread pandemonium! The lords are warring! Mass confusion among the citizens! Or... that's what I expected to happen. None of that seems to be taking place. They had a roundtable meeting and talked it out. Everyone's dealing very calmly with the situation. I guess if Dimitri turns out to be a crazed despot, then there really will be chaos. But he's not going to go crazy again. He's OK now... Right?



Leonie: The Death Knight is guarding Fort Merceus. The same one who was linked to Monica and to Flayn's abduction five years ago. Anyway, he's one of the monsters responsible for Captain Jeralt's death. We have to defeat him!



Seteth: Fort Merceus is a keep that was constructed to defend the Imperial Capital, Enbarr. We cannot enter the capital without first capturing that fort. But once we have it, the city should be almost entirely at our mercy. Now that we know Rhea is there, we must move with the utmost urgency.



Flayn: The Death Knight. I shudder to think of him. Professor, you remember my connection to him, do you not?
Byleth: Of course. 
Byleth: Uh, what happened?
Flayn: What! You have forgotten about when I was kidnapped five years ago?!
Flayn: I am still working on the trauma from back then, all these years later. If we meet him, I swear I will have my revenge.



Hanneman: Fort Merceus is the Empire's single most fortified military installation. Utterly impregnable, they say. I wonder, do you happen to know the nickname given to Fort Merceus?
Byleth: The Silver Maiden
Hanneman: No, I'm afraid that name refers to the Fortress City of Arianrhod.
Byleth: FÃ³dlan's Locket
Hanneman: That one is a fortress that stands at FÃ³dlan's Throat.
Byleth: The Stubborn Old General 
Hanneman: Indeed! A very good answer, but of course you'd know that.
Hanneman: Seems FÃ³dlans give everyone and everything a nickname. Why, you were called the Ashen Demon! Myself, I have been called the Father of Crestology, which is a nickname as well as a title, I suppose...



Manuela: Each step closer to Enbarr, I'm reminded of another part of my past. Riches and poverty, glory and failure, that city has it all! And if I'm honest... sometimes I miss it. That's how the past works though, isn't it? It's always a different story than what you really lived.



Gilbert: Even in the Kingdom, only a few people knew about His Higness and Edelgard's relationship. Me? I always knew those two to be like brother and sister. To think that we would come to see this world, where they are at war with one another... I live it, and I can still barely imagine such a truth.



Alois: So, Lady Rhea was in the Empire all this time. Wish I'd known that five years ago, but there's nothing we can do about it now. What we can do though is topple the Empire! Will you seize victory with us, Professor? For the sake of the late captain!



Catherine: We took quite the detour. It was time-consuming, but finally we got the information we needed. We crush the Empire, we get Lady Rhea back. Two birds, one stone. First, we take Fort Merceus. I'll put my heart in it. I'll crack 'em like a rusty helmet.



Shamir: Weren't the Kingdom and Alliance once part of the same country? If you think about it that way, it makes sense for them to unite. I suppose the Kingdom was once part of the Empire as well. Even if FÃ³dlan came together, I wouldn't be surprised if it fell apart again



Cyril: Is it true Lady Rhea was taken to the Empire? Why'd they take Lady Rhea? Professor... they didn't take her to kill her, did they?
Byleth: I don't think so.
Cyril: That's good. We just gotta beat the Imperial army and get her back, right?
Byleth: They probably haven't killed her. 
Cyril: Yeah, good point. If they did, we'd have heard about it by now.
Cyril: You gotta help her Professor. I'm begging ya.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Is it true that we'll be assaulting Fort Merceus next? That doesn't sound like the brightest idea... I've heard that it's built to withstand an attack from even the largest of armies! Not to tell you how to do your job, but don't do it! I'm not ready to say my final good-byes to everyone...

@Opening 
The Kingdom army crosses the Great Bridge of Myrddin a second time, moving south through Gronder Field. However, in order to reach Enbarr, they must first seize the impregnable Fort Merceus.

@Intro 
Dimitri: Fort Merceus... said to rival Arianrhod, the Silver Maiden. Perhaps a head-on siege was a foolish plan, after all.
Gilbert: No, you're right that it's the only way. I don't think the Death Knight would have fallen for any tricks. Even if they are denied supplies, they could hold a fortress like this for months. And we cannot discount the possibility that they will receive more reinforcements if our siege is delayed.
Dimitri: Yes, my thoughts exactly. Then we have no option but to do the best we can. Say, Professor... In the past, it seemed the Death Knight took some strange satisfaction from his fights with you. He's an unpredictable opponent. A dangerous one. Please proceed with caution.
Byleth: No need to worry.
Dimitri: I have not come this far just to lose you here. I'm serious. Do not be reckless out there.
Byleth: Will you save me if I'm in trouble?
Dimitri: Of course. You were the heart of the Blue Lions, and the same holds true for the Kingdom Army.

Dimitri: Mercedes...
Mercedes: So, the Death Knight really is inside that fortress. Dear Emile...
Dimitri: I want you to know that no one is forcing you to battle with us at the front lines. I support whatever you decide.
Mercedes: Please, stop. We can't have you saying that. You and I are the same after all. We both have to fight our family for the good of the world... And since that's the way it is, I couldn't live with myself if I was the only running away from this battle. I will bring Emile back to his senses. I must. I'm his big sister, after all.
Dimitri: Understood. Stay safe out there, Mercedes.

Death Knight:  That man approaches...
Imperial Solider: Report! The main gate has been breached!
Linhardt:  Ugh... How did I get tangled up in all of this...
Death Knight: You are finally here... Will death's scythe claim you... Or will I fall to that sword of yours... And Mercedes... Here you are as well...

@Opening 
After saving the embattled Alliance, you march south to Empire territory. Fort Merceus, said to be impregnable, stands between you and Enbarr, the Imperial Capital.

@Battle 
Death Knight: They broke through the main gate... Trample them. All save... that man...
Dimitri: Even though we smashed the main gate, Fort Merceus is still an ironclad fortress. And the enemy commander is the Death Knight. We must not falter in our assault!

Dimitri: I now see why they call this keep impregnable. Everywhere you turn is defensive weaponry. We must capture all of those locations as we push forward. If even one of them takes a shot at you, we will be in trouble.

Death Knight: Fools. Push forward and surround them...

Gilbert: Worrisome. They have a leader capable of summoning reinforcements. If we find and strike down that person, we can prevent further interruptions.

Gilbert: There will be no further reinforcements from this side. However, the other side is still in action.
Dimitri: If they call in more reinforcements, we'll be in great danger. We must take down the other commander as well and fast.

Dimitri: Good. Now we should not have to worry about any more reinforcements crashing the party.

@Boss 
Caspar: Did you have to kill a lot of your friends to get here? Cause I'm gonna give this fight everything I've got!

%Byleth,Caspar
Caspar: It's way over my head, and I don't really get what's going on between you and Edelgard. I thought for sure you two would come to an understanding, but I guess I was wrong.

%Linhardt,Caspar
Caspar: Looks like we ended up on opposing sides, Linhardt!
Linhardt: Certainly seems that way. I could almost weep over how things turned out. Do you realize, Caspar, that this is the first time we've ever fought?
Caspar: Yeah, I think you're right. The first and probably the last!

@Boss
Caspar: Don't worry about me... I always knew... losing meant death...

Linhardt: I'd rather not fight, yet avoiding it is more frustrating and fruitless than engaging in the battle itself.

Linhardt: Ever since returning to the Empire, I knew this day would arrive. I just hoped it might take a bit longer. Ugh...

Linhardt: I hope someday there will be no fighting and we can all just... nap the afternoon away...

Death Knight: I have no need of you.

%Byleth,Death Knight
Death Knight: You're stronger now. Whether I kill you or you kill me, I'm looking forward to this!

%Dimitri,Death Knight
Death Knight: You dare stand between me and my pleasure?
Dimitri: Yes. I dare stand against you, Death Knight.
Death Knight: Death is all that remains...

%Mercedes,Death Knight
Mercedes: I came here to get you. Let's return together... Emile.
Death Knight: Leave... The place of your death is not here...
Mercedes: No! I won't! I... I refuse to run from you anymore!

%Flayn,Death Knight
Flayn: So it's you, Death Knight! Remember me?!
Death Knight: You again. Here to lose more blood?
Flayn: Never! You will not lay a hand on me ever again!

%Seteth,Death Knight
Seteth: You will not escape, Death Knight. Today you will be unmasked!
Death Knight: My true identity has no value.
Seteth: I will be the judge of that, once I've seen your face.

@Boss
Death Knight: To kill, to die... To know one without the other would be maddening...

@End 
Dimitri: The enemy general has been vanquished! Everyone,move to gain control of the keep! Victory is ours! Raise the banner of the knights. May it soar proudly over the impregnable fortress!
Mercedes:  Oh! I have to meet... I have to meet Emile!

^locked
Mercedes: Emile... I'm so sorry... This is all my fault for leaving you behind when I left House Bartels. I should have gone back for you sooner...
Jeritza: Argh...
Mercedes: I'm sorry for not being a better sister to you.
Jeritza: Mer...cedes...
Mercedes: Please forgive me, Emile...
Annette: Mercie, we need to go. Now.
Mercedes: ...Good-bye...
^end

Gilbert: Your Highness, our capture of the fortress is complete.
Dimitri: Now the path to the Imperial Capital is finally opened to us. Once we've finished cleaning up after the battle, let's have another meeting to discuss our next move.
Byleth: We should have a victory celebration.
Dimitri: It would be one thing if we were at home or at the monastery, but to waste our resources like that here would be most-
Byleth: Aren't you overworking yourself?
Dimitri: Naturally. But it matters not. Consider this... Once this war is over, the mountain of official business on my plate will be even taller. If I can't handle at least this much, how will I-
Kingdom Soldier: Pardon the interruption! We've just received a letter from Margrave Gautier.
Dimitri: Very well. I will read it at once.
Dimitri: I see... It seems the conflict within Faerghus has at last come to an end.
Kingdom Soldier: Yes, Your Highness! The Margrave and the other eastern lords are at the center of it, and are gathering the Kingdom's military forces even now, They intend to join with the Alliance army and send troops and supplies to the monastery.
Sylvain: Whaddaya know... My old man is really pulling his weight. Did he seem well?
Kingdom Soldier: Yes, as well as can be expected. He has taken it upon himself to bring order back to our troubled territory while His Highness is away.
Dimitri: I am truly in the Margrave's debt. I will be sure to thank him properly at first opportunity. Thank you for the information. Now tell me, did it seem to you that my presence was needed back at the monastery?
Kingdom Soldier: Well... I do have a verbal message from the Margrave on the subject.
Dimitri: A verbal message? How strange...
Kingdom Soldier: The other day, he arrested one of Viscount Kleiman's men. And, well... The prisoner has claimed involvement in the Tragedy of Duscur. He has implicated his lord as well.
Dimitri: Go on.
Kingdom Soldier: I was told they would be transporting this man to the monastery along with the troops and supplies. The Margrave said that regardless of the credibility of the man's testimony, how he should be dealt with was your decision alone, Your Highness.
Dimitri: Very well. All things considered, I will return to the monastery at once. Will you come with me Professor?  Thank you.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
After storming the streets of Enbarr and bringing Imperial forces to their knees, the Kingdom army surrounds the Imperial palace. But the enemy that awaits them is not the Edelgard they once knew...

@Intro 
Dimitri: We have annihilated Enbarr's army. If we strike her down now, this war will finally be over. I imagine she intends to keep fighting until the bitter end...If this is the end she has chosen, it is my responsibility to see it through with her. Isn't that so...emperor of Adrestia? We have no choice but to destroy each other...Such is the destiny we were born to. That is why...I will now rise up to answer her iron will with the bite of my lance.
Dedue: I will protect you at all costs. We will both live to see tomorrow...Your Majesty.
Felix: Hmph. If the king falls here, that would mean my father's and brother's deaths were in vain.
Ashe: For Lonato, Christophe, everyone...I will not lose!
Sylvain: Well, if I were to die now, I'd have a lot to explain to my brother.
Mercedes: All will be OK. I know we can win!
Annette: I won't falter, no matter who we're facing!
Ingrid: For all those who have lost their lives in this war...We cannot lose!
Byleth: Let's win this!
Dimitri: It is time. Onward, to our final battle!

Hegemon Edelgard: They are here...But my progress cannot be stopped, no matter how many people try. The war's end will spell destruction for one of us. There can only be one ruler of the world...

@Battle 
Dimitri: Edelgard must be in the throne room...I would love nothing more than charge in and settle this once and for all, but we must be mindful of the surrounding forces.
Ingrid: Strange...The mages don't seem to be wearing their usual imperial uniforms.
Gilbert: Look at the mages. They are not wearing their standard Imperial uniforms...
Myson: We cannot allow our grand ambition to be stopped by these beasts...

Dimitri: Gah! Where did that attack come from?! If we do not find out, we have no chance of avoiding it!
Mercedes: We're in danger! Advance with caution!
Dimitri: Everyone, stay on your guard!

Dimitri: I can hear voices from the lower levels...Could it be enemy reinforcements?
Ashe: Maybe if we take control of those stairwells now, we can prevent reinforcements.
Gilbert: Avoid losses by taking control of the stairwells! Block the enemy reinforcements!

Dimitri: So...that grotesque creature was Edelgard...If she is prepared to transform her very body to fight for this future of hers... Then I have no choice but to defeat her, even if it costs me my life! We must defend the present... After all, it is all that we truly have.

Dimitri: Reinforcements from the lower levels... Will they ever stop coming?
Sylvain: General, calm down! Get control of the stairwells. Cut off the enemy's entry point.

@Boss 
Myson: We will return this world to mortal hands...May that filthy race of beasts wither and die...

Myson: A curse upon those damned beasts...
Mysterious Soldier: Myson! Everyone, retreat! We cannot sacrifice our goal!
Dimitri: The mages are retreating! So, those weren't Imperial mages after all!
Felix: Stop yammering! We must advance, boar!

Hegemon Edelgard: These fools are caught up in the sacrifices at hand and can't see the future ramifications at stake. We must bury them! We must trample the past underfoot and move on to a brighter tomorrow!

Hegemon Edelgard: You shall be obliterated! I will take you out so fast you will not have a chance to lament.

%Byleth,Myson
Myson: I'll take you down, here and now...For the sake of the new dawn...

%Byleth,Hegemon Edelgard
Hegemon Edelgard: Facing you... I grow weak...

%Dimitri,Hegemon Edelgard
Dimitri: To be changed beyond all recognition.. That is what lies at the end of the ideals you served so diligently. I have no pity for one such as you. If that is the future you hoped for, then you deserve no compassion.

@End 
Hegemon Edelgard: Graghhhhh!
Dimitri: Edelgard...It is over.

@Cutscene 
Dimitri: El...

@Narration 
A rising flame was alight as the flow of time carved a new history for FÃ³dlan. The long reign of the Adrestian Empire finally met its end when the Imperial Capital, the city of Enbarr collapsed. After five and a half years of war, a new age was set to begin. With FÃ³dlan united as the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, Archbishop Rhea, still weak from her imprisonment, stepped down from her position, and the Church of Seiros began to take the needed steps to reorganize. Prince Dimitri formally ascended the throne, beginning his reign as the king of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, which now included former Alliance and Imperial territories. Texts from the time claimed that the one who guided the king as he sought to create a world free from oppression became the new archbishop of the Church of Seiros.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Having repelled the Imperial vanguard, the Kingdom must now supplement its meager forces. And so it requests reinforcements from Rodrigue, who is busy resisting Cornelia's army in Fraldarius territory.

@Dialogue 
Dimitri: You made it.
Felix: We received a reply from my father. You should read it too.

Rodrigue: Gilbert has filled me in on the details. He tells me you are in immediate need to additional troops. I would like to say that I will gather reinforcements and send them to the monastery at once... However, I cannot afford to leave the front lines for that long. Would you be willing to meet us south of Fraldarius territory in Ailell, the Valley of Torment? Ailell is halfway between the monastery and our territory. There, I will deliver the soldiers you require.

Byleth: The Valley of Torment...
Gilbert: Ailell lies on the border between Kingdom territory and Alliance territory. Humans dare not approach that place.
Dimitri: He's right. In Ailell, we can meet up with them without our enemy ever finding out.
Felix: Once my old man delivers his soldiers to us, then our war against the Empire can finally begin.
Gilbert: The path ahead will be a difficult one, Your Highness. Deadly, in all likelihood...
Dimitri: True. But what's the point in wavering now? Father, Stepmother, Glenn, and even Dedue... I am certain this will bring them great joy. I know if I can just offer them Edelgard's head... I just know it...

Kingdom Solider: Ailell, the Valley of Torment...

@Conversation 
Dimitri: Go away.



Felix: Hmph. I am steeling myself to see my father again. I can't stand that old man.
Byleth: But he's your father.
Felix: That's just biological circumstance. We may have the same blood, but we've nothing else in common.
Byleth: You really hate him. 
Felix: Yes, I do. Above all, I hate the crazed nonsense that comes out of his mouth.



Ashe: The Kingdom capital or the Imperial capital? I don't know which is the right way. If we tried to take on the Empire like this, would we really stand a chance? With House Fraldarius under attack, they probably can't spare many soldiers. On the other hand, if we did manage to take the Imperial capital, the war would be over. Hmm... I'm no good at thinking through this kind of complicated stuff.



Sylvain: Ailell, the Valley of Torment. Aw, man... I really do not want to go there.
Byleth: Pull yourself together.
Sylvain: Professor, have you ever been to Ailell? If you had, you'd know.
Byleth: Why not?  
Sylvain: That place is crazy hot! For guys like me who grew up somewhere cold? Man... It's gonna be rough. Though, I guess that climate will keep our enemies at bay.



Mercedes: I don't know about everyone else, but heading to the Empire seems like a good idea to me. The search for Lady Rhea will be so much easier if we can just get the Empire out of the way. I suppose Dimitri might still pose a problem though. He seems so fixated on the Imperial capital, but... I get the feeling he's not even sure what he wants anymore.



Annette: If we can take back the Kingdom, we'll recover our soldiers. And some food and supplies too, I bet. Most importantly of all, there are people in the Kingdom waiting for our help. Even His Highness understands that. I'm sure of it. Yet he wants to take on the Empire despite all that... Do you think...he just doesn't care about anything other than fighting Edelgard anymore?
Byleth: That's not true.
Annette: But if not, then why...
Byleth: You may be right.
Annette: He wasn't always like this. What happened...



Ingrid: It is imperative that we regroup with those who continue to resist. Most importantly, we must join up with the Fraldarius family. If we do, our ability to reclaim the Kingdom capital is ensured. We should aim for this outcome rather than focusing our efforts on the Imperial capital. This seems to me the best strategy at present. But I feel what His Highness feels--his hatred, his anger--so keenly, as if it were my own. So I find it difficult to oppose his wishes.



Ferdinand: Some day we will take the Imperial capital. It is odd to think that I will be invading the very city that I once called home. Ah, that is still a ways off. I will prepare for our journey to Ailell.



Linhardt: I never do get used to the sight of blood. It always makes me feel as if I might faint. I suppose I've told you that though, yes? I've no idea how you cope with it. I hope this war ends soon. I dislike being lightheaded because other people are bleeding everywhere. Though the thought of working hard for it does sound like quite a pain...



Caspar: We weren't related by blood, but Randolph was still my uncle... Seeing him end up that way was... Never mind. It's nothing.
Byleth: That's how it goes with war. 
Caspar: This wasn't just about war. It was a grudge. Or are you gonna tell me you're on Dimitri's side?
Byleth: I'm so sorry. 
Caspar: It's fine. I don't need your sympathy. It's not like I had any real connection with him anyway. But Dimitri's methods... I don't know...
Caspar: I'm sure he never trusted me, being born in the Empire and all.

Bernadetta: Ailell, the Valley of Torment? What kind of a name for a place is that? It sounds scary. Do I really have to go with you? Hey, um, here's an idea... Maybe let the recluse stay home and hold the fort!



Dorothea: This is all a bit troubling, isn't it? The people from the Kingdom seem to be of two minds, as well. Can we really plan to fight when we're this unsure of ourselves?
Byleth: Maybe fighting will actually help... 
Dorothea: You think once we're face to face with the enemy, it might help us band together? I hope so.
Byleth: It's hard to say.
Dorothea: Well, Professor, I hope you can bring everyone together. You might be the only person who can.



Petra: Since the past, I have learned much of the language of FÃ³dlan. But speaking the FÃ³dlan language still gives me difficulty. I can understand, read, and write with nearly perfection now. But understanding and speaking are...fruits of a different color.
Byleth: That's part of your charm. 
Petra: I have gratitude for you, Professor. I hope that I will have fluency one day.
Byleth: Everyone has a weak spot.
Petra: Yes. I will keep practicing more.



Raphael: Ugh...so...hungry... I won't be able to train if I don't get some food in me! I used to eat until I was full, but nowadays I can't even get seconds! Aren't reinforcements supposed to be joining us soon? I hope they bring food along with them... I still want my little sis to live in the town here, but there's no point if we can't even feed her!



Ignatz: The Valley of Torment... I'd heard of it, but I never expected to go there. It's exciting! I wonder what the landscape is like.
Byleth: It sounds dangerous.
Ignatz: It probably is dangerous, but I still want to get there and see it as soon as I can.
Byleth: It sounds painful. 
Ignatz: Hm, that is an interesting point... The name does seem to suggest that.



Lysithea: Ailell, the Valley of Torment, lies on the border of three noble territories. The Kingdom's Fraldarius and Galatea families, and the Alliance's Daphnel family. Incidentally, the Galatea family was originally an offshoot from the Daphnel family.



Marianne: Valley of Torment... Valley of Torment...
Byleth: Something wrong? 
Marianne: I once read a book full of legends surrounding Ailell, but I can't seem to remember...
Byleth: Are you chanting some sort of curse?
Marianne: N-no... I'm trying to remember the legends surrounding Ailell...
Marianne: I feel there is something dreadful I'm forgetting.



Hilda: I heard we're headed to the Valley of Torment. I'm not exactly thrilled. That place is supposed to be really, really hot. Just the thought of it makes me uncomfortable.
Byleth: You don't like hot climates? 
Hilda: I hate them! You get all sweaty and sticky and eugh!
Byleth: You want to stay here?
Hilda: Ooh, that's not a bad idea! Though if our enemies attacked while I was here, that would be a pain too...
Hilda: Ugh! Who names a place Valley of Torment? A more inviting name would have been nice. Valley of Endless Summer, something like that!



Leonie: You're not a teacher anymore, and we're not your students, but everyone still calls you Professor. Is there something you'd rather be called?
Byleth: Professor is fine.
Leonie: Guess that's what we're used to, huh? All right.
Byleth: Call me by my name. 
Leonie: Oh? All right, then. I'll call you--ugh. Nope! Sorry, can't do it. Too weird.



Seteth: Meeting reinforcements in the Valley of Torment seems an astute decision to me. In that land of oppressive heat, it is unlikely that we will be disturbed. It also means we will need to contend with those harsh conditions ourselves, however. Best ensure we are well prepared.



Flayn: It has been only five years, yet so much has changed. Half of the Kingdom has fallen to the Empire. Skirmishes are rife throughout the Alliance. Despite such tumult, we look upon the same sky, unchanged by the storm happening beneath it.
Byleth: Do you wish you could return to those days?
Flayn: Yes, it would be nice, I suppose. Things were...simpler then. Or so they seemed to be, at the time.
Byleth: It's true--it's just like it was all those years ago. 
Flayn: Indeed. I gazed up at this same sky with Mother and Father. It does not feel so long ago at all. Wait, but how would you know, Professor?



Hanneman: The monastery repairs have made solid progress. Most excellent news. When we first returned here, I was unsure what we were going to do with the ruins of this place... But if we can get the cathedral rebuilt, we'll have it looking just like old times soon enough.



Manuela: Gilbert was a knight to the royal family of Faergus? What was a man like that doing in Garreg Mach, I wonder? Who knows. Whenever I try to ask about it, he'd change the subject and avoid giving a proper answer.



Gilbert: These past five years, Lord Rodrigue worried for His Highness more than any other. But I wonder what he would say if he saw what has become of Dimitri...



Alois: The Kingdom doesn't seem to have clear goals holding them together. Different people have different priorities. The situation right now is difficult. But at times like this, you have the opportunity to really shine, eh Professor? You're in charge. Show them what you're made of! I'll do what I can to help.



Catherine: Strategically speaking, our best move is probably to head for the Kingdom capital. Though, I think it's more likely that Lady Rhea is in the Empire, so I would not object to taking the fight directly to Edelgard. Hm. There are no right or wrong answers in war. What do you think we should do? I hope, with the goddess's guidance, we can make the right choice.



Shamir: There are enemy spies around. Remain vigilant. Capture anyone who seems suspicious.
Byleth: To kill them?
Shamir: What else would we do with them?
Byleth: All right, I will. 
Shamir: I'm glad you understand. I'm counting on you.



Cyril: Gotta clean out the storerooms, tend the flowers, do the washing, dust the library...
Byleth: That sounds like a lot of work.
Cyril: Well, it's my job, ya know? Gotta do your job.
Byleth: Do you need any help? 
Cyril: Nah, this is my job. Lady Rhea herself gave it to me. Even if Lady Rhea's not here right now, I still gotta do my duty.
Cyril: Like you. You gotta have other stuff you oughta be doing, yeah?



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Is everyone setting out on a big campaign? Not exactly? Ah, so you're meeting up with the reinforcements. Well, you can leave guarding this place to me! I'll keep an eye out for anything suspicious!

@Intro 
Gilbert: This valley isn't a place I'd care to return to . . .
Ingrid: After the chilliness of Faerghus, I can't seem to adjust to this extreme heat.
Sylvain: Historically, there have been battles whose outcomes were determined in part by the climate. You can't argue that this heat isn't a factor.
Ingrid: In conditions like these, who knows what will become of our morale . . .
Gilbert: Professor, be honest. How are you holding up?
Byleth: I'm at my limit.
Gilbert: Don't overexert yourself. Perhaps it would be best to take breaks as we proceed.
Byleth: I never imagined it would be like this...
Gilbert: Monks once used this area as an ascetic training ground because of the intense environment.
Gilbert: They say Ailell was born of the goddess's rage...
Byleth: Her rage?
Byleth: I hadn't heard that before.
Gilbert: If you believe the legends, this valley is evidence of the goddess's judgement...passed on humanity for its corruption. The forest that once covered the surrounding area was burnt to ash by a pillar of light that descended from the heavens. That legend fueled belief in a place of torment between our world and the next...where one's sins are purified in the cleansing flames.
Dimitri: Nonsense. Sins are not so easily washed away.
Gilbert: Indeed ... And there are no accounts of such a place in scripture. Yet those who cannot face their own sins have no choice but to cling to the idea.
Dimitri: ...
Mercedes: Ugh, I just don't think I can take this heat anymore. I think I'm starting to see things... Near those mountains over there.... Is it just me, or is there a group of people gathered there?
Gilbert: No... It would seem you are not hallucinating after all.


Dimitri: That is House Rowe's banner. They curried favor with that witch and sold out Faerghus.
Gilbert: We messed up. There must have been a spy among us... Will you have us meet them in battle or wait for Rodrigue to arrive?
Dimitri: There is only one option. How kind of them to save us the trouble of killing them later.
Byleth: Aren't they your former allies?
Dimitri: Never call those traitors our allies again.
Byleth: They sold out the Kingdom, right?
Dimitri: I will not repeat myself.
Dimitri: That banner belongs to the Gray Lion. It's a waste of breath to exchange words with one such as him.
Gilbert: His Highness is correct. He is not an opponent whom we can expect to negotiate with. Everyone! Prepare for the attack!

@Opening 
Your party travels to Ailell, the Valley of Torment, to meet up with allied troops and secure reinforcements. It should have been a safe march...

@Battle 
Gwendal: The Valley of Torment . . . Perhaps a good place to finish off my life as a knight. Only if that puny force of children is able to kill me, of course . . .
Gilbert: That man, who raises the Lion's flag? Lord Gwendal. He is an elder knight who serves House Rowe. Gwendal would, without thought, fight any battle if ordered. There is no chance of negotiating with him.


Gilbert: Ailell is a deadly place. Flames burst from the ground with no warning. Sane people usually avoid it.
Dimitri: So, the flames of torment burn your sins, your life, your everything. If you wish to spare yourself the goddess's wrath, tread lightly.

Kingdom Soldier: Here we go! Attack them from both sides!

Rodrigue: So Cornelia has planted spies even inside Garreg Mach.
Gwendal: The Shield of Faerghus has appeared! We can expect more out of him than the young ones.

@Battle-Talk 
%Byleth,Rodrigue 
Rodrigue: To meet you in a place like this... No, that won't do. I'll leave the talking until after the battle. Here's a small souvenir for you. Put it to good use.

@Boss 
Gwendal: Does a whelp like you really expect to kill me? I am Gwendal, the Gray Lion, a knight by the hand of Count Rowe! Do your worst!

Gwendal: Ah, so I have found a place to die . . . Young ones . . . I thank you . . .

%Dimitri,Gwendal
Dimitri: The man praised as a lion is degraded to a mere traitor's underling.
Gwendal: A traitor's underling? That's upsetting, Your Highness. I am and always have been a knight of House Rowe.
Dimitri: How dare you? You are nothing but a lowly beast scavenging for scraps. You have forgotten the dignity of knighthood.
Gwendal: I may be lowly, but this beast is loyal to his master.
Dimitri: Ha! Then I had better kill a pet and deliver its head to that master . . .

@End 
Rodrigue: It's been too long, Your Highness. But try to temper your joy, will you? This is a war, after all.
Dimitri: To say such a thing at a time like this. You have not changed one bit.
Rodrigue: Don't let looks deceive you. I've had a rough go of it ever since I crossed blades with those traitors in Fhirdiad. When I heard you'd been executed, I rushed there as fast as I could, blind with fury. When I got there, I was fed some garbage about not being able to see your body. The next thing I knew, I was gripping my blade and... Gilbert, you have done well to locate His Highness. I am truly grateful.

Rodrigue: And you... I have you to thank, as well.
Byleth: As his professor, it was my duty.
Byleth: We were all fortunate.
Rodrigue: Well, we are in your debt. I will repay you for this someday, I swear it. And you, Felix... You have also done well to bring His Highness here.
Felix: Hmph.
Dimitri: Tell us all you know, Rodrigue.
Rodrigue: I'm afraid there's not much to tell. You are aware that the western region of the Kingdom was taken by the Empire, correct?
Dimitri: Yes, so I have heard. They are now calling it the Faerghus Dukedom or some nonsense.
Rodrigue: If you know that much, then the rest won't take long. Enemy or not, it's undeniable that Cornelia's plan was nothing short of genius. After seizing power, she invited the Imperial army to Fhirdiad. There, she reorganized her troops and then sent soldiers to hunt me down. Because of that, we were forced to act defensively. And now we're being forced into a difficult battle. She's been controlling the situation all along.
Dimitri: So that's been the witch's plan from the start. I should have killed her ages ago.
Rodrigue: Your Highness... Fhirdiad is in a terrible state right now. The tyranny is unbearable, and so the rebellions are endless. Refugees starve to death in the streets. If I may speak freely, Your Highness... We should change course for Fhirdiad and take down those traitors before we embark to Enbarr.
Dimitri: There's no time for that. We must annihilate Enbarr before all else.
Rodrigue: Think this through. I understand wanting to destroy the Empire and the emperor. I want that so much it hurts. But which is more important, the dead or the living?

Dimitri:  SILENCE.
Rodrigue: No, Dimitri, you will hear me out.
Dimitri: Are you asking me...asking the dead...to forgive that woman?
Rodrigue: No, I would not ask that of you. What I am asking is that you allow us to prioritize the Kingdom capital over the Imperial capital for now. As Lambert's close and trusted friend, I am confident that he would have advised the same.
Dimitri: Do not dare to put words in the mouth of the dead. They are your words alone, even if you borrowed their lips. Until I offer up that woman's head, Father will remain a slave to his lingering regret and hatred... Even now, he suffers. It is ceaseless. As we waste time with idle chatter, his suffering continues!
Rodrigue:  You are my king. Our king. Wherever you lead, we will follow. But Your Highness... There are those who take up their sword in the name of revenge, and yet along the way, lose the strength and composure to follow through... You would do well to bear that in mind.
Dimitri: ...
Rodrigue: Ah, I nearly forgot. Take this, Your Highness. The time has come for it to be wielded by its true master.

Dimitri: Areadbhar... The Hero's Relic once wielded by my father.
Rodrigue: The very same. I managed to steal it back from one of Cornelia's underlings in Fhirdiad.
Felix: Understated as ever, Father. It must have been a true struggle to get it back.
Dimitri: I... I am grateful, my friend.
Rodrigue: Gilbert, Professor. May I request something of you? I wish to fight at your side.
Felix: Senile already, old man? Who will protect our territory?
Rodrigue: I expected it would come to this, so I left those matters to my younger brother. He has my complete faith. I must keep my promise to our fallen king...to my dear friend.
Byleth: What promise?
Rodrigue: A very old one. I swore it nearly 10 years ago. Now then, Your Highness. Let's destroy the Empire together. My men and I will spare no effort. I pray that you are right...and that this will save the Kingdom.

Rodrigue: Our orders are to capture Enbarr by striking the enemy stronghold directly... How familiar are you with the geography of FÃ³dlan?
Byleth: Very familiar.
Rodrigue: Then you must be aware that the Kingdom and the Empire are separated by the impassable Oghma Mountains, right?
Byleth: Not very familiar.
Rodrigue: The Kingdom and the Empire are separated by the impassable Oghma Mountains.
Rodrigue: Legend has it that Saint Seiros once crossed over those mountains to fight against the Fell King Nemesis... But don't fool yourself. Leading an army over such steep mountains would be near impossible.
Gilbert: In order to infiltrate the Empire, we have no choice but to go around the mountains, either to the east or to the west.
Byleth: Let's go east.
Rodrigue: Yes, I agree.
Byleth: Let's go west.
Gilbert: Hmm. I believe that may be difficult. After all, the western region of the Kingdom is already loyal to the Empire. Perhaps we should consider going east...using the route that passes through Alliance territory.
Rodrigue: The Alliance is currently split in two. Those who stand with the Empire and those who are against it. Leading the Imperial faction is House Gloucester, while House Riegan leads those who oppose. We should take advantage of their internal conflict and proceed east along the mountains until we reach the Great Bridge of Myrddin in Alliance territory.
Byleth: Why there?
Gilbert: The Airmid River divides Alliance and Empire territory. There are many large bridges that cross it. However, the Great Bridge of Myrddin is by far the largest, and it is also the closest to the monastery. I believe you crossed that bridge five years ago on your journey to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion.
Byleth: It's risky...
Rodrigue: I'm afraid we have no other option. This is our only hope.
Byleth: What if the Empire and the Alliance both attack?
Gilbert: I'm afraid it's a possibility. But it's still more practical than passing through the west.
Rodrigue: Perhaps our next move should be to contact House Riegan and request their cooperation...
Byleth: Do you think they'll help us?
Rodrigue: Claude of House Riegan is the leader of the Alliance and is firmly against the Empire. They are the enemy of our enemy... In other words, hopefully a friend.
Dimitri: Are you suggesting that we ask House Riegan to engage the Gloucester soldiers?
Gilbert: I am. If we take the bridge, then House Gloucester will no longer be able to receive help from the Empire. There's no way a man as wise as Claude would refuse our request.
Rodrigue: And once we manage to capture the Great Bridge and gain a foothold into the Empire...
Dimitri: Then we cross Gronder Field and head south toward Enbarr.
Ashe: But if we get attacked from both sides, we'll have to fight people from the Alliance, won't we?
Mercedes: Speaking of House Gloucester, I wonder how Lorenz is holding up...
Annette: If we meet him again, it will probably be as enemies. To be honest, I'd rather avoid seeing him altogether.
Dimitri: If you do not wish to kill familiar faces, do not tarry over the corpses of the dead.
Felix: Hmph. Good advice.
Dimitri: Prepare yourselves. It is time to steel your souls for the task at hand.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Following the death of Rodrigue, Dimitri begins to question his desire for revenge. His troubled mind turns to the kingdom capital and how he might end the chaos plaguing Faerghus, once and for all.

@Dialogue 
Gilbert: Our victory at Gronder was certainly a turning point for us. However... Rodrigue's death has been difficult to bear. We've lost considerable military strength and resources.
Byleth: Are there no lords we can rely on?
Byleth: Is there no way to secure more soldiers?
Sylvain: Unfortunately, with things as they are now, I don't think House Gautier has any resources to spare.
Ingrid: I'm sorry. I really wish we could help. If only house Galatea had anything to give...
Gilbert: If we split up the soldiers currently defending the monastery, we should have sufficient numbers to invade the Empire. But even then...
Dedue: Your highness! You should be resting. Your wounds are still healing...
Dimitri: I am well, I assure you. More importantly... may I have a moment of your time?

Dimitri: Thank you. I wish to apologize. To all of you. I have led you down this dark path with me, and have cost so much suffering along the way... I cannot tell you how sorry I am for my behavior. There is no apology I could offer that would be sufficient.
Felix: Hmph. And how do you intend to make up for my father's death?
Dimitri: Felix... I realize words alone are not enough to repent, but I fear they are all I have.
Felix: Iâm not after more empty words. I want you to speak through your actions.
Dimitri: ... I know that no amount of regret can ever bring back the lives we have lost. I... I know that well. It is like patching up a tear with a different material. Things can never be as they were. The best I can hope for is to make things whole again. I wish to do the right thing from now on. 
Dimitri: That is why I have made a decision... I intend to take back the kingdom capital. I wish to save our people, those who I turned my back on for far too long. To follow my heart and do the right thing... That's the only way I can atone for my sins.
Gilbert: Your highness... If we can win back Fhirdiad, it will give us the advantage in our war against the Empire. As one who has served the royal family for ages, know that your words bring me great joy. And pride. That said, I must point out that if we make for Fhirdiad, the Emperor's head will slip further out of reach. Can you live with that?
Dimitri: I still hold hatred in my heart for her and for the ones responsible for the tragedy... That, I will carry with me until death. 
Dimitri: But... my life is my own. It belongs to no one else, and it is high time that I started living for what I believe in. I will no longer allow the voices of the dead to bind me. This is something that I must do... No. Something that I am choosing to do. I will accomplish my aim, even if it means risking my life to do so.
Gilbert: Understood, your highness. So? Any objections?
Byleth: None.
Byleth: Count me in.
Seteth: You are correct. We cannot afford to die in vain by recklessly challenging the empire.
Mercedes: I'm worried about Lady Rhea... but if this is the choice you've made, I support it.
Dedue: I am at your command, your highness. I will follow you anywhere.
Ashe: My sword is at your service, your highness.
Annette: I'll help too! The people in Fhirdiad need us!
Felix: Fine. I'll help you...in my father's stead. But in return, you must win. You know that, don't you...Dimitri?
Dimitri: I do. And I swear on my father's lance that we will prevail.
Gilbert: Then it is decided. It seems this war council has much to discuss. Our next stop is Fhirdiad, the Kingdom capital. For the future of Faerghus!

@Conversation 
Dimitri: I really caused trouble for you, didn't I... I am so sorry. Truly. I am also...eternally grateful to you. Now, it's time to go to the Kingdom capital. I hope that you will lend me your strength once again.



Dedue: Everyone is saying His Highness is back to his old self, but I do not think that is accurate. What he was until recently is what he had been for as long as I've known him. So tortured by his compassion for the fallen that it had driven him mad. He has always been too kind to be king. He has always felt too much for the weak and the dead. That is exactly why I look up to him.



Felix: He'll need to excel as a leader, if he's to make up for my old man's death. Though if my father could see Dimitri now, he'd be glad to have made the sacrifice. Don't you dare tell anyone I said that.



Ashe: I was born and raised in Faerghus, but I've never actually been to Fhirdiad. Do you think it'll still be cold at this time of year? I can't even imagine.
Byleth: We should prepare for the cold.
Ashe: You're right. It's an important battle, so let's make sure we're ready for anything.
Byleth: Maybe we should ask someone. 
Ashe: Good point. I'll check with His Highness.



Sylvain: I don't feel like I can just forget all the awful stuff he's done... But if His Highness is owning up to his past, and trying to move forward... I figure I can give him that chance. We've been friends since we were kids. I'm gonna be there for him all the way to the end.



Mercedes: I agree that we should head for Fhirdiad, but let's not forget our search for Lady Rhea! The soldiers from the church are going to set up a base at the Great Bridge of Myrddin. They'll be able to keep up the search while we head for the Kingdom capital!



Annette: The Kingdom capital... It's been way too long since I was there last... Oh, Professor! I didn't mean, ah.. It's not that I'm looking forward to it or anything.
Byleth: You don't have to hide it. 
Annette: Ah! Please don't tease me like that!
Byleth: This isn't a vacation.
Annette: I know that! We're preparing for battle!
Annette: It's just... when I think of us finally saving everyone in Fhirdiad, it makes me a little happy. OK, maybe a lot happy. The Kingdom capital is under the tight control of Cornelia, who was ennobled by the Empire. Judging by what we heard from Lord Rodrigue, it sounds like she's a tyrant. But all of that ends soon. Let's get there quickly!



Ingrid: We buried Lord Rodrigue's body ourselves. There wasn't a time to do things properly. It pains me that I was unable to take him home to his territory. Once this war is over, I'd like to hold a proper funeral for him. For now, we need to focus on taking back Fhirdiad. All will be well eventually. I know we can win.

Ferdinand: Dimitri hated the Empire with a fiery passion. At Gronder, driven by fury, he sent many good knights to their doom... Now he appears to be freed from that hatred. If he can make thoughtful decisions, unswayed by his emotions, he may make a fine king someday.
Byleth: Kings are only human.
Ferdinand: No, they are not. A king must strive to be a king first and a human second.
Byleth: Kings can't have feelings? 
Ferdinand: No, they cannot. Kingly judgment has to be wholly separate from the emotions of the individual.



Linhardt: There are stories of Heroes' relics a thousand years ago of which we have no real evidence today. So many, in fact, that I'm led to wonder if those Relics are nothing more than legends. Especially since we know of relics like those passed down in the families of the 10 FÃ³dlan Elites.



Caspar: Can you believe it, Professor? Dimitri actually apologized to me! Remember that awful business between him and my uncle Randoph? He just came by and said he was sorry for all of that. That was behind us so far as I was concerned, but even so... It seem like he's changed for the better.

Bernadetta: It's always so peaceful coming back here. But it's hard to relax knowing we have to go out on another expedition again so soon. And now we're headed to the Kingdom? That sounds hard! Oh, really hard! Don't you think?!
Byleth: It's going to be tough. 
Bernadetta: I knew you'd think so! I knew youâ Ow! Oh ow. Can't believe I tried to hug you through the door...
Byleth: We'll be fine.
Bernadetta: Of course you'd say that! Why'd I even ask?!



Dorothea: So many people died in the battle at Gronder... And here we are, preparing for the next battle, as if nothing happened the day before. It's almost easier to think of war as theater, with the stage an entire continent.
Byleth: Though the actors die, the show goes on? 
Dorothea: Something like that. If an accident happens on stage, the next day's performance must unaffected.
Byleth: It really doesn't seem like theater.
Dorothea: Even if an accident happens on stage, the next day you have to sing as though nothing happened.
Dorothea: Everyone just pretends like everything is fine... focusing on their role in the play.



Petra: Taking back the land of home has the most importance. That is why I am fighting...all for my land of home. Actually, there is more... I am also fighting for you and for everyone here.



Lorenz: It seems we will soon set food in Fhirdiad. I used to live there, you know. Though that was before my time in the Officers Academy.
Byleth: Were you a hostage?
Lorenz: No, of course not. There is a school of magic there, which I was enrolled in for a time.
Byleth: Were you a traveler? 
Lorenz: That's right I was enrolled at the school of magic there for a time.
Lorenz: Trouble within the Kingdom forced me to return to Alliance lands. There was much I had yet to learn.



Raphael: You know when you work your muscles and they start screaming? That means you gotta be nice to them. If your muscles are hungry, you gotta feed them, and let them rest when they're tired.
Byleth: I don't see how you'd do that.
Raphael: Whaddya mean, how? You just gotta eat and sleep! It's pretty obvious...
Byleth: You can tell how your muscles are feeling? 
Raphael: Of course! If my muscles hurt, then I hurt. If they're hungry, well then I'm hungry too!
Raphael: What's with the confused face, Professor? You look like you don't get a word I'm saying!



Ignatz: The battle at Gronder Field was gruesome, wasn't it? But perhaps it's irresponsible to look awayâto close our eyes to the horrors of war.
Byleth: I agree.
Ignatz: As survivors, we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain. We must see the tragic foundations upon which we'll build our future.
Byleth: You don't have to force yourself.
Ignatz: Thank you. But I think I do actually. As survivors, we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain. We must see the tragic foundations upon which we'll build our future.
Ignatz: May an age of peace rise from the ashes, so that all this sacrifice means something.



Lysithea: I'm relieved the the prince seems to have finally come to his senses. Though it's a really shame that Lord Rodrigue passed away. It really is. But now I think we're starting to see a sliver of hope for the future of FÃ³dlan.



Marianne: I never used to care whether I lived or died... But after seeing so much death firsthand, I now realize how precious life truly is. I'm ashamed of how arrogant I was to think that death could mean so little...



Hilda: Fhirdiad huh? I've always wanted to go there. But I rather be visiting for fun, and during a warmer season. And going into battle? Not exactly an appealing prospect! Heh, I'm just teasing. I'll do what I can to help. I'm just so relieved that Dimitri is his old self again.



Leonie: Dimitri's completely changed. Or maybe I should say he's finally back to normal. Either way, I'm glad he's come around to the idea of retaking Fhirdiad. With our current troops, there's no way we could handle the Imperial capital. We wouldn't even get past Fort Merceus.



Seteth: It seems we are headed for the Kingdom capital this month. The Church of Seiros stands ready to lend its aid to you and Dimitri. It may be a roundabout route, but I believe this path will still eventually take us to Rhea. Besidesâsaving the people of Faerghus is just what she would want us to do.



Flayn: Standing face to face with those whom I went to school with. On the field of battle... How inhuman isâhow horrifying. My heart feels shattered. It is my hope that this war marks the end of such foolish behavior.s



Hanneman: There's a school of sorcery in Fhirdiad, which is staffed by the top minds of magical research. The study of Crests and sorcery should not be separate. I've always thought I should pay them a visit someday. I never imagined I might end up invading the place with an army though. Not how I imagined it at all.



Manuela: Fighting with three different groups in the mix was as confusing as it was difficult to survive. Enemies and allies dying one of top of the other... What an absolute mess, huh? If only I had my infirmary out in Gronder, maybe I could have saved a few more lives.

Gilbert: I am very grateful to you. I could never have achieved this on my own. This is all thanks to you and Lord Rodrigue. This month, we will invade Fhirdiad by way of the Fraldarius domain. Leave the negotiations with House Fraldarius to me. You make ready for the actual battle. It is a tricky business, but we are taking our first steps forward.



Alois: The emperor was wounded at Gronder Field. What do you think is going on in the Empire now? The Leicester Alliance has really suffered a blow as well. Who knows what will become of them? From now on, we have to pay close attention to how the rest of FÃ³dlan is doing.



Catherine: If we're headed to the Kingdom capital, that means we're further away from rescuing Lady Rhea. But it can't be helped, can it? Perhaps some people will question this decision, but I trust your judgement. Lady Rhea would want us to help in Fhirdiad. She'd scold us if we rescued her and left innocent people suffering.



Shamir: So we're turning around and heading for the Kingdom capital? Ridiculous. Tell him to cease this nonsense. Isn't there a saying in FÃ³dlan. Something those with power knowing how to use it? If he's not careful, the goddess will send her saints to smite him. Not that I believe that...



Cyril: Guess what I noticed. I can see further than most other people can see. But I can't see figure the point of seeing further than an arrow can fly, since I can't shoot what I see.
Byleth: You could detect enemy movements in advance.
Cyril: I suppose I could see a whole horde of enemies coming and run away. That's kinda useful, at least.
Byleth: You could find our targets quicker than anyone. 
Cyril: Yeah, I suppose it could be real useful for finding Lady Rhea too.
Cyril: Thanks, Professor. I think I get it now. I'm gonna put my eyes to real good use.



Anna: A class reunion on the battlefield? That's...bleak. That must have been so hard on everyone. You gotta keep looking after them all. I mean, they still look to you for guidance, you know?



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Fhirdiad is a city with a long history that goes back to before Faerghus gained its independence. I'd like to visit that place at least once before I die, but I'm afraid I have my own work to attend to. It's hard being so dedicated! Ah well. I'll go there for some leisurely sightseeing once FÃ³dlan knows peace!

@Opening 
Despite their victory at the Battle of Gronder, the Kingdom army turns around and marches for Fhirdiad instead of heading south.To hail the arrival of the Kingdom army, the people of Fhirdiad begin to rebel. No move is made to suppress them. Instead, Cornelia directs her borrowed Imperial troops to prevent Dimitri from reaching the Kingdom capital.

After Rodrigue's death, Dimitri reassesses his plan of attack. For the sake of the Kingdom, he chooses to forestall an invasion of the Empire in favor of securing his own capital city of Fhirdiad.

@Intro 
Dimitri: Fhirdiad... It has been a lifetime since I was last here. Five years ago, in fact. On the day before my execution, when Dedue helped me escape from prison. I killed soldiers from my homeland, stole weapons from their corpses, and made my escape, soaked in their blood. To think this is how I would return to the city of my birth, after all that has happened...
Byleth: You have Rodrigue to thank.
Dimitri: Yes, Rodrigue gave his life to show me the way back to this path. You have risked much as well.
Byleth: I'm proud of you.
Dimitri: I do not deserve that. If not for you or Rodrigue, I would still be lost...
Dimitri: I am glad to have you at my side. From the bottom of my heart...I am forever grateful. Let's win this, Professor. Let's all make it out alive and celebrate our victory.
Gilbert: Your Highness. The path to the castle has been cleared. We are making preparations to advance. Say the word, and we march.
Byleth: Give the order.
Byleth: It's time!
Dimitri: Yes... Let us begin. Everyone! Listen well! This battle is for all that the Empire stole from us. It is a fight to reclaim the days of peace we once enjoyed. I give you but two commandsâstay alive, and follow your heart. That is all I ask. The gates to the Kingdom capital are open. Join me! It is time to take back our home!

Cornelia: I thought I would see you again, little princeling. Heh, so stubborn. It must run in your family.
Dukedom General: Cornelia! The city is overrun with insurrection. It seems to be in response to our enemy's arrival. If we do nothing, our army may suffer damages. We should suppress the citizens immediately.
Cornelia: The people are rebelling? Ha! Let them do as they please. Or are you saying you have enough soldiers to divide our forces? Quite bold of you, with our enemy's most elite soldiers at our doorstep.
Dukedom General: But... What are you suggesting?
Cornelia: The city is going to be a battlefield anyway. Kill all who oppose us, even if they are members of the general populace. Go on now. You are needed out there.
Dukedom General: As you wish. May we find fortune in the battle to come.
Cornelia: Hmph. What an inconvenience the little princeling has turned out to be. And bringing that troublesome person along with him... It would have been much better if he and his sweet little stepsister had been good little children and just killed each other.

@Battle 
Cornelia: The preparations are all in place. Time to meet my old master. Ready the Titanus in the streets! Let's give them a welcome to remember.

Dimitri: Advance! Smash that traitor Cornelia and reclaim the capital! I will not lose... I swear it by the blood in my veins...

Dimitri: Bah! These things are surprisingly tough.. Are they being reinforced by magic?
Gilbert: If there is magic in use, we should find the source and eliminate it.
Cornelia: Weren't the Titanus enough for you? Well then! we had better active the Viskam!

Dimitri: That should stop the supply of magic. Now we should be able to land attacks on those things.
Gilbert: These strange devices and weapons... They are the Empire's? Unbelievable.

@Boss 
Cornelia: My, what a charming little guest. Let me take care of you.

%Byleth,Cornelia
Cornelia: Hm. I can't quite say that I'm pleased to meet you. Though I do know quite a lot about you. It would be nice if we could catch up a little . . . But I'm afraid it's time for you to die.

%Dimitri,Cornelia
Cornelia: My, it's been a long time hasn't it, Your Highness? You've grown awfully strong.
Dimitri: How shameless. I bet it was you who killed my uncle and set me up. Am I right?
Cornelia: Hah! Too true! I'd already forgotten all about that loveliness.
Dimitri: I'll kill you, you monster! You will pay for all that you have done!

%Gilbert,Cornelia
Cornelia: Ah, your face brings back memories... Still alive, are we, Gustave?
Gilbert: Prattle on, Cornelia. Faerghus will not be cowed by the likes of you.
Cornelia: How very dull...

@End 
Cornelia: Well, so be it. Still, I'll give you a little gift ...
Dimitri: It's over, Cornelia. If you have any last words, now is the time.
Cornelia: Right you are. Very well ... I have an old tale that I would like you to hear, if I may. About something that happened ten years ago ... Something Patricia said about how she wished to see her real daughter again, no matter who or what she had to sacrifice to do so ... And about how I made her wish come true, at the cost of the king's head ...
Dimitri: The king's head? You mean Duscur ... You monster! You mean to say that my father ... everyone ... was killed by my stepmother?!
Cornelia: That's right. Her family meant everything to her... You certainly know that feeling, do you not? Ah, poor little prince. Unloved by the only mother he ever knew... How pitiful.
Dimitri: How dare you!
Cornelia: There's nothing left for you now... Nothing but despair.

Gilbert: ...

Dimitri: Try as that woman might to spout nonsense to her very last, nothing could change the fact that she was an enemy of the kingdom. She sold out Faerghus to the Empire, forcing our people to suffer their tyranny... But all that ends today. No more blood will be needlessly spilled. Now the Cornelia has fallen, we will exert pressure on the nobles who were aligned with her. Perhaps we may yet find a connection to the tragic incident in Duscur. Once we do that, we will finally be able to prove the innocence of its people.
Dedue: Your highness... I am certain that would make those of Duscur who lost their lives that day very happy. I am grateful. And I am proud to serve a man such as you.
Gilbert: Come, your highness. You still have some responsibilities that must be carried out. Your people have been patiently awaiting your return.
Dimitri: Do you mean... No. I can't bear to face them after all that I--
Byleth: We're going.
Byleth: You must face them.
Dimitri: Professor... Right you are, as ever. I am their king, after all...

Dimitri: What... what is this?
Gilbert: As you can see, the people are rejoicing at the return of their king.
Dimitri: Even though I turned my back on them, and fled the kingdom in disgrace...
Gilbert: Even so... the spectacle before you does not lie. We are a kingdom in need of a king. A hero to save the people from their long oppression. Your highness... It is truly a blessing that you have returned.
Dimitri: Do I really have the right to stand here? Will they accept me as their king? Bloodstained as I am... Am I fit to be king?
Byleth: If you atone, all will be forgiven.
Dimitri: Yes... you are right again, my friend.
Byleth: Don't cry, Dimitri. This is a happy time.
Dimitri: These are happy tears, my friend.
Dimitri: I am finally home again... Faerghus... How I missed you...

Dimitri: It may be spring, but the nights are quite chilly here in Fhirdiad... Still, our celebratory feast shows no sign of stopping. Have you grown weary of the festivities?
Byleth: I have.
Dimitri:  If memory serves, you were much the same at the ball, all those years ago.
Byleth: I was going to ask you the same.
Dimitri: It's not that I have grown weary... more that I find it difficult to be around everyone at the moment.
Dimitri: I have just returned from visiting the graves of my loved ones. It had been a long while since I left flowers. I was always terribly afraid of going near there... But I could not stay away forever. You have taught me something important, professor.
Byleth: Studiousness?
Dimitri: That too, of course. But what I am referring to is far more valuable.
Byleth: Swordsmanship?
Dimitri: That too, of course. But what I am referring to is far more valuable.
Byleth: Humor?
Dimitri:  You never let up, do you? No, what I am referring to is far more valuable.
Dimitri: How should I put this... Perhaps it is most accurate to say that...you taught me how to live. If you and I had not reunited on that fateful day, I am certain I would have died a fruitless death on the battlefield. I would have foolishly challenged a horde of foes and, in doing so, needlessly sacrificed the lives of my friends and myself. But now, I have returned to my rightful place. I stuffle with what to say, when I know well that words are not enough to express my gratitude. You save me from the darkness...and guided me back to the light. Thank you, Professor. With all that I am, I thank you.
Byleth: Are you happy?
Dimitri: That...is a hard question to answer. I still do not believe I deserve happiness. These hands of mine have taken so many lives... Nobles and commoners. Adults and children. Perhaps a day will come when I have finally atoned for my sins...but such a day is not possible until after the war is over.
Byleth: Do you still wish for revenge?
Dimitri: Revenge was never something I wished for... It was an obligation I felt I had inherited from those who died. I believed my life belonged to those who lost their own in Duscur. But what I now seek is something else entirely... I can say that with confidence.
Dimitri: But I digress... For tonight, our only focus should be to bask in our victory. After that we must prepare for our battle with the Empire. To start, we must absorb the Kingdom knights taken by the Dukedom into our own forces and reshuffle our troops. The lords will need help purge our territory of Imperial forces, and I will use my authority as king to gather forces from various regions... And we'll have to ask the merchants to lend us the fund we require... Oh, and we must request delivery of supplies at once...
Byleth: That sounds like a lot of work.
Dimitri: Heh... Just thinking about it makes my head spin.
Byleth: Good luck with that.
Dimitri: I cannot handle all of this work myself, you know. I will be counting on you, Professor.
Dimitri: There is much to do, but it is all critical work if we hope to stand a chance against the Empire.
Byleth: Is there no way to coexist with the Empire?
Dimitri: Knowing Edelgard, I doubt there is a path that leads to our coexistence.
Byleth: You will soon face Edelgard...
Dimitri: Yes... I am well aware.
Dimitri: I believe we have spoken of this before... Everyone has something they simply cannot accept. As for Edelgard, I am certain she will never be able to accept the Church of Seiros. I believe that is why she seeks to destroy it. She is looking to revolutionize the world. In her mind, for the better. But even if she manages to birth a new world... it would be at the cost of... I wish to end this war through acceptance, not annihilation. Just as my people accepted me, I wish dearly to accept her. But I fear -
Kingdom Soldier: Your Highness! I finally found you!
Dimitri: Ah, I am sorry for slipping away. Has something happened?
Kingdom Soldier: An express messenger just arrived from the leader of the Alliance. Please return to the castle at once.
Dimitri: An express messengers? What in the world could Claude be after? I am on my way. Professor, please join me.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Now in control of the Great Bridge of Myrddin, the Kingdom army begins to invade Imperial territory. In response, the Imperial army garrisons soldiers at Fort Merceus.

@Dialogue 
Gilbert: We have received a report from our spy. It would seem the Empire is gathering troops at Fort Merceus. This is undoubtedly in response to us taking the Great Bridge of Myrddin. Their numbers are more than double ours. We believe that the emperor herself may be leading them...
Dimitri: ...
Gilbert: If House Riegan can reconcile with House Gloucester sooner than later... Then Claude can proceed with his plan to rally the Alliance lords, gather troops, and invade Empire territory.
Rodrigue: At this rate, three military forces will be clashing at Gronder Field.
Byleth: Just like five years ago...
Byleth: Just like the Battle of the Eagle and Lion...
Dimitri: If you wish to indulge in nostalgia, do it elsewhere.
Rodrigue: I'm afraid the difference in military strength is far from negligible. While we are elite soldiers, I am still uneasy about this...
Gilbert: If possible, I'd like to request reinforcements right away. If we can rely on any of the major Kingdom houses for military support, it would be...House Charon, I'd wager.
Byleth: Why them?
Gilbert: House Charon has yet to declare fealty to the Empire.
Catherine: It is also...my home. I will make the request to my father. With things as they are, I don't think he can refuse. The church has long protected me. I am certain that any request from the church will be answered to the utmost of their ability.
Rodrigue: Very well. We're counting on you, Catherine.
Gilbert: I suppose that is all we can do for now.
Rodrigue: So it would seem. Though, if there are any other avenues worth exploring, I would suggest...
Byleth: Allying with the Alliance?
Gilbert: Ah, good point. We have no reason to engage the Alliance directly.
Rodrigue: Even if we do receive Count Charon's aid, we still won't have the troops we need to face the Empire.
Gilbert: But if we join forces with the Alliance, then our numbers will rival the Empire's.
Byleth: Let's join forces.
Gilbert: Agreed. It's about the only thing we can do.
Byleth: Let's wait and see.
Gilbert: If we wait too long, we'll lose the advantage...
Gilbert: For now, let's send a messenger, and try to figure out what the Alliance hopes to achieve.
Rodrigue: It's hard to believe this decisive battle will take place at Gronder Field... I image that place is full of memories for all of you.
Mercedes: We won the Battle of the Eagle and Lion back in the day. It seems like a lifetime ago...
Ashe: I can't help but remember, even though I wish I didn't.
Ingrid: Our feast after the battle... I remember it well. We all had so much fun together.
Annette: No! Please, stop it. I had finally put all of that out of my mind... This isn't right. They're our friends! We used to study together. We shouldn't be fighting them.
Sylvain: Why not march up to Her Majesty and remind her of that? Oh, that's right...because you want to live to see tomorrow.
Dedue: No matter who the enemy is, I will fight for His Highness.
Felix: Tell me, boar prince. Do we stand a chance?
Dimitri: Who knows...
Felix: If we lose, we'll have died for you. I hope you know that.
Dimitri: ...
Rodrigue: That's enough, Felix. We must focus on the battle ahead.
Dimitri: Make your peace before we depart. It's kill or be killed out there. We will cross blades with the Empire, but it's possible we will also have to strike down the Alliance.
Gilbert: Your Highness... Do you feel no hesitation about killing your former friends?
Dimitri: If they must die, I will kill them. Nothing could be simpler.

@Conversation 
Dimitri: I can finally kill her... Finally... I can avenge them...



Dedue: You have my sincerest gratitude. Circumstances, and my wounds, have prevented me from being by His Highness's side these five years. I am grateful that you have found him for me. I am once again in your debt.



Felix: As powerful as our knights are, we're outnumbered. By a long shot. This won't be easy. It's crazy to attempt this. I guess I'm crazy to go along with it.



Ashe: If we defeat the Imperial army at Gronder Field, what will our next objective be? I guess we won't have much choice but to try to take Fort Merceus, on the far side of Gronder Field. It's probably too soon for us to be thinking about that, isn't it? The battle just ahead of us is far from certain.



Sylvain: Say we do manage to take down Edelgard here... What do you think His Highness will do next? As long as there's a plan, I won't complain. I just, you know, wanna know there is a plan.
Byleth: Continue on to the Imperial capital?
Sylvain: Yeah, I suppose that's the most likely plan since we're traveling with the church and everything.
Byleth: Head to the Kingdom capital first?
Sylvain: Heh, well, I'd be happy if that were the case, but I don't figure that'll actually happen. All this isn't just going to magically end the moment we kill Edelgard. It's gone too far.
Byleth: I don't know...
Sylvain: Heh, well, if even you can't say, I guess it's not surprising the rest of us don't know either.
Sylvain: I suppose we should focus on the battle right in front of us instead of what happens later.



Mercedes: So, we're finally going to set foot in the Empire... I'm starting to get a little nervous. I guess there's a good chance we'll be fighting more old friends from here on out.



Annette: The thought of fighting people who were once our friends...it makes my heart heavy. If it was gonna come to this, maybe I should have avoided making friends with people from the Empire and the Alliance to begin with...
Byleth: You might be right.
Annette: You think so too, Professor? I'm glad it's not just me.
Byleth: I don't think that's the right attitude.
Annette: I just don't know, Professor. I'm having a hard time with it.
Annette: It did often seem strange to me at the academy that we were studying with all these people from all over the world. But I feel like I've finally started to understand the real reason behind it. The more you get to know people from other places, the harder you'll try to avoid fighting wars with them...



Ingrid: Yet another grand battle awaits. Many will lose their lives.
Byleth: There's no way around it.
Ingrid: I am well aware. This is war, after all.
Byleth: Let's fight our hardest to stay alive. 
Ingrid: Yes, let's. We must both make it home in one piece.
Ingrid: Even considering those we are up against--friends from a time now past--I won't hold back.



Ferdinand: We captured the Great Bridge of Myrddin, but the fight has only just begun. Enbarr, the Imperial Capital, lies far to the south, beyond Gronder Field. And waiting for us on the way there is the entire Imperial army, with twice as many troops as us. We had better brace ourselves.



Linhardt: I seem to lack the skills required to grieve for the dead. If someone has passed, even someone dear to me, I could stand about and wail or get on with my life. While I'm at it, that whole idea that we must speak well of the dead? I don't understand that either. If I didn't like them when they were alive, then why pretend to do so when they are no longer here?



Caspar: After we cross the Great Bridge of Myrddin, we'll be in my father's territory. We actually crossed it five years ago for the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. Remember? Ugh! This is terrifying! What am I gonna do? I gotta get a grip...
Byleth: Don't worry, I'll arrange for your funeral. 
Caspar: You think we'll meet him on the battlefield and he'll kill me? The front lines cover a long stretch of land, you know! We might not even run into him!
Byleth: I'll pray for your safety.
Caspar: Oh, no no no. You should pray we don't run into him at all! The front lines cover a long stretch of land, you know!

Bernadetta: So the campaign continues, does it? Well, allow me, as a professional recluse with ten years of experience, to volunteer for, um...staying behind. Oh, who am I kidding? The fighting won't stop until we've defeated Edelgard, will it? Or until we lose, I guess. But there's not much use in thinking about that.



Dorothea: The Great Bridge of Myrddin was considerably better fortified that it was five years ago... The bridge was full of soldiers...and they all died.  And Ferdie was there. We killed Ferdie, Professor, he used to be our friend. Do you remember those days?



Petra: Nobles who are changing allegiance, again and again. I do not have understanding for that. How can you trust if treason comes with ease? How can you be calling yourself a noble? I do not have understanding of the reasoning...
Byleth: They're struggling for survival too.
Petra: Surviving is more difficult without trust. There must be...some other goal.
Byleth: For personal gain. 
Petra: Survival has more importance than that. Are they not knowing this?



Lorenz: So, Claude and my father have made peace. That is to be expected. They both prioritize their own interests above all else. So long as those interests are in alignment, they will continue to cooperate. And based on that reasoning, one might infer that the Alliance should be also willing to work with the Kingdom's military. I highly doubt Claude would refuse to assist us, if we were to ask.



Raphael: I gotta say, it's tough to keep the fighting spirit alive when you recognize your enemies on the battlefield.
Byleth: Everyone gets that feeling. 
Raphael: So you can't avoid it, huh? How did everything get so messed up?
Byleth: You can run away if you want.
Raphael: Hey, come on! Even I know we can't do that!
Raphael: Just because we're fighting someone doesn't mean we gotta hate 'em! That's probably the worst thing about war. Win or lose, I still get a bad taste in my mouth.



Ignatz: Thanks to our victory, I've been able to study the Great Bridge of Myrddin at my leisure. And you know what? It's an astounding structure. So much history there. Imagine how much time and effort it must have taken to build something that big. Over water, no less! I hope that someday it will be opened up to the people of FÃ³dlan--a historical site, rather than a military checkpoint.



Lysithea: I'm glad you're the one giving orders on the battlefield, Professor. I don't think we should trust Dimitri with that task... Although it's thanks to his obsession that we're wasting no time, taking the shortest route to defeating the Empire. I just can't see a bright future for this army, fighting as we are under the banner of a prince possessed. Even if we do succeed in defeating the Empire, I wonder what will become of FÃ³dlan. I apologize. Whenever I'm with you, I speak more openly than I should. Please keep this between us.



Marianne: The situation in the Alliance has changed so much, but I haven't heard a word from my adoptive father... Do you think he's forgotten about me?
Byleth: I'm sure he's just busy. 
Marianne: If that's the case, I hope he gets even busier.
Byleth: I'm sure that's not the case.
Marianne: I'm not overly concerned about him...
Marianne: I'd actually be happier if he really did forget about me. Everything would be so much easier...



Hilda: I heard the next battle might take us to Gronder Field. Is that right? Reminds me of the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. But of course, that was a very different time. When it was over, all three class heads complimented each other on their bravery. And then we had a party. But we can never go back to that, can we?



Leonie: I heard Edelgard is going to be leading her forces personally in the next battle. Seems pretty reckless to charge right into this one. I'm not sure I like our chances. What do you think?
Byleth: Don't worry. I can handle it. 
Leonie: I don't know why you're so confident, but it does somehow make me feel better.
Byleth: As long as you're here, I'll be fine.
Leonie: Hey, how come you only ever flatter me in times like these? What am I supposed to make of that?
Leonie: Anyway, we've come this far. Let's just keep putting one foot in front of the other and see how far we get.



Seteth: Each time we press forward, our search for Rhea broadens to a wider area. I certainly hope we will find at least some clue, but I do suspect I already know where she is. If I am right, and she is in the Imperial capital, then we cannot save her until we topple the Empire.



Flayn: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion. Has it truly been five years since then? Can you recall whether it was before or after I joined your class, Professor?
Byleth: Before.
Flayn: That is not at all the case, Professor. Your memory serves you poorly.
Byleth: After. 
Flayn: I am glad you have not forgotten.
Flayn: It was shortly after I joined your class--I remember it like it was yesterday.



Hanneman: When undertaking research, the usual method is to form a hypothesis, then test it with experiments. Those experiments reveal facts and falsehoods, yet sometimes, they also unveil an exception. You seem to be that exception when it comes to my Crest research.
Byleth: Sorry about that. 
Byleth: I don't understand.
Hanneman: Worry not, Professor. Exceptions are what make my work interesting. Why don't the rules apply to you? I will find out, eventually. I feel it is my destiny as a Crest scholar!



Manuela: I hear the next battle could be a big one, is that true? I miss the old days when, if someone got hurt, we'd rush them to the infirmary and make them well... But on the battlefield, there's not enough time to help. People die. Professor, don't be one of those!




Gilbert: Catherine will surely be able to convince Count Charon. All that remains is to wait for a response from the Alliance side... For now, there are preparations to be made for the coming battle.



Gilbert: Catherine has successfully convinced Count Charon. However... The knights we sent to the Alliance have yet to return.



Alois: Word just reached me that the Empire has stationed soldiers in Fort Merceus. If they decide to dig in their heels and defend the fort, we'll be in a difficult situation. I hear it's an impregnable keep, surrounded by high ramparts. Taking it would not be easy.




Catherine: Hey, Professor. Itâs been a while... Well, actually not that long. If youâre here about the reinforcements, no need to worry. Iâve sorted everything out with my father. If the Alliance agrees to chip in as well, we might have a real chance at victory.



Shamir: Reconnaissance is becoming more of a risk the deeper we move into enemy territory. If I don't come back, assume I'm dead.
Byleth: I know you won't get caught.
Shamir: I'm glad you think so highly of me, but we have to be realistic.
Byleth: Understood. 
Shamir: Good. We have to be realistic.
Shamir: Don't waste your energy worrying about me.



Cyril: I gotta keep this place clean, and I mean properly clean, every day. Dust it, sweep it, everything. You never can tell when Lady Rhea might be back.



Rodrigue: Hm? Oh, it's you, Professor. Sorry, I was a little lost in thought there. About all that has happened, and all that is to come... I'm sure the battles ahead will not be easy, but please take good care of His Highness.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! I hear we're sending troops to Gronder Field next. Is that what's what? That whole area is in the territory of House Bergliez. It's famous as the main granary of FÃ³dlan. If we could capture it, we probably wouldn't have to worry about food anymore! Bread for all!

@Intro 
Gilbert: There's quite a bit of fog settling in. We won't be able to advance our troops very far in this.
Rodrigue: We won't be able to move at all until the fog lifts, no matter which path we take. We'll have to be patient and wait it out. ... Gilbert. No... Gustave. I would like to take this opportunity to speak with you about something. It's about the Tragedy of Duscur. There's something about it I just can't wrap my head around.
Gilbert: I'm listening.
Rodrigue: I lost a son in Duscur that day. I exhausted every last resource I had to investigate what took place there. I was startled to find that...there wasn't a single shred of evidence to suggest that Lady Patricia's carriage had been attacked.
Gilbert: Go on...
Rodrigue: Apart from His Highness, whose injuries left him on the verge of death, everyone else present at the time was slaughtered. Of all the victims, only the corpse of Lady Patricia, His Majesty's second wife, was never found. Isn't that right?
Gilbert: Hmm... Surely that means she was abducted. There was no evidence of an attack, suggesting they threatened her but did not kill her...
Rodrigue: But what reason would they have to take her? Would it not have been better to kill her?
Gilbert: Perhaps she had some value as a diplomatic pawn.
Rodrigue: Nonsense. In the many years since that day, has Lady Patricia ever been used thus?
Gilbert: No... Not as far as I know. Then perhaps she was used for some political gain within the Empire.
Rodrigue: Now that her daughter is the emperor, what reason would she have to keep hiding her existence?
Gilbert: It is possible she passed away after returning to the Empire...
Rodrigue: Gustave, I know this is hard for you to hear, but just consider what it would mean if Lady Patricia was involved with that incident...
Gilbert: Silence, Rodrigue. I will not allow you to tarnish her memory like that.
Rodrigue: I do not mean to imply that she arranged His Majesty's murder or anything of the like. But Gustave... I cannot shake the feeling that the tragedy was part of a much larger conspiracy. There is more to it than we know, that much is certain...


Kingdom Soldier: Rodrigue! Gilbert! Please, hurry!


Gilbert: To kill like this...is inhuman.
Rodrigue: This is one of the knights who was dispatched to the leader of the Alliance. Tell me everything you know.
Kingdom Soldier: Sir! A soldier on patrol came across this knight a short while ago in a rocky area not far from here. Someone from the Alliance must have disposed of the body there...
Gilbert: Is this how the Alliance chose to inform us that they have no intention of joining our cause?
Byleth: Could Claude really have done this?
Rodrigue: The Alliance lords each have their own motives. It's difficult to say for sure who was behind this.
Byleth: Maybe it was the Empire...
Dimitri: Yes. I would not hesitate to believe them capable of this.
Rodrigue: Whatever the truth is, the other knights we dispatched are in serious danger. It's best to assume that joining with the Alliance is out of the question now.
Gilbert: Even with Count Charon's support, this makes our situation grim...
Dimitri: I never expected the Alliance to help us. Anyone who stands in my way will be crushed beneath my feet...


Fleche: It is time, dear Brother...

@Opening 
The Kingdom army departs from the Great Bridge of Myrddin and marches south toward Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Meanwhile, the Alliance army follows from behind to invade Imperial territory, and the Empire has dispatched forces from Fort Merceus to intercept them. The curtain is rising on a conflict between the three armies, which will come to be known as the Battle at Gronder, held on the same plains that witnessed the Battle of the Eagle and Lion.

At Gronder Field, where the Battle of the Eagle and Lion was once held, the house leaders of five years ago have a fateful reunion...but this time, the contest between the Empire, the Kingdom, and the Alliance is no mock battle.

@Cutscene 
Dimitri: Know that I will tear your heads from your shoulders. The dead must have their tribute.

Claude: As big class reunions go...this one's gotta be the worst in history.

Edelgard: Years ago, we fought here as classmates. But not today.

Dimitri: Kill every last one of them!

Edelgard: And so we fight on.

@Battle 
Dimitri: You have finally appeared, Edelgard. Now you are mine.
Claude: The Kingdom army doesn't look interested in joining forces. Let's take a moment and see how this Unfolds...
Edelgard: It would not be advantageous to take on both at once. We must stop the Kingdom and the Alliance from joining forces. I will create such chaotic warfare that will not be able to tell who is friend and who is foe.

Edelgard: Mounted units. Advance!

Petra: The center is in danger of being taken. We must be running to protect it! 

Imperial General: There are enemies in the central area... We need to head there immediately to protect it! 

Claude: Hmph. The Empire and Kingdom are mixed up in this battle. It's a struggle to target the right one. Such are the rules of Melee. We'll just have to crush anyone who isn't an ally!

Claude: They wanna crush us before the Imperial Army? Then we'll show them what we'll made of!

Leonie: Great! I may not have a Crest, but I'll give it my all. 

Hilda: I'm not going to hold back. I can't let down my dear old Claude. 

Edelgard: Those fools who went up the central hill will pay with their lives... in the crimson flames! 

Hubert: The central hill is up in smoke. Suppose I'll have to quench the flames - with the enemy's blood. 

@Boss 
Lysithea: Don't expect me to go easy on you. Because I won't.

Lysithea: I thought I'd be able to live...just a little bit longer than...this.
Claude: Lysithea... She burned too brightly, and faded too fast... 

Ignatz: I am helping Claude build the future of FÃ³dlan!

Ignatz: It's over for me. I did my best
Claude: I'm sorry, Ignatz... I wasn't able to save you... 

Leonie: I can't hold back just because I know you. Sorry, but that's war.

Leonie: S-so this is it. I did what I could, Captain Jeralt...
Claude: Leonie fell? Did I underestimate the enemy? 

Raphael: There's no way you're gonna beat me! You're better off turning tail and running away!

%Byleth,Raphael
Raphael: Wow, it's sure been a while! You're a tough opponent, Professor!

@Boss
Raphael: Claude... Take care of my little sis...and the Alliance...
Claude: Raphael! Don't worry, I promise to look after your sister... 

Hilda: You didn't forget about me, did you? Maybe you should just let me go.

Hilda: I have to get out of here! I'll die if I don't.
Claude: Hilda, you've done well. Leave the rest to me. 

Claude: So sad that our reunion should take place on the battlefield.

%Byleth,Claude
Claude: So, you're actually alive, Teach! It's a shame you aren't on our side. Anyway, isn't the Empire your enemy? Us fighting seems like a waste...

%Dimitri,Claude
Claude: Calm down, Dimitri! What does it achieve, us killing each other here?
Dimitri: Move, Claude. I have no time to exchange words with you.
Claude: It doesn't matter what I'm saying, does it? You aren't even listening. But I'm not gonna budge.

@Boss
Claude: Arrgh... I thought we had a chance, but there was no way to predict the movements of the Kingdom army. I can't afford to die here. I have to retreat.

Bernadetta: Stay back! Stay back or I'll shoot.

%Byleth,Bernadetta
Bernadetta: Professor? Is that you? You're with the enemy. That means I... I'll have to kill you.

@Boss
Bernadetta: Wish I could've at least died at home... not in this big, stupid field...
Edelgard: Bernadetta, thank you. I'll make sure your life was not lost in vain. 

Petra: For Adrestia and for Brigid... I will be defeating all of you!

Petra: I can't be fighting anymore... I must be retreating now...
Edelgard: Don't worry. You must live on to lead your people. Those fools who went up the hill will pay with their lives... in the crimson flames! 

Hubert: You're interfering with the plan. Looks like I'll just have to get rid of you.

Hubert: Fighting on will endanger my life. Your Majesty, I must withdraw.
Edelgard: No need to worry. We still have some troops left. So long as I stand, we won't give up.

Edelgard: I will destroy both the Kingdom and the Alliance. Now, with one fell swoop!

%Byleth,Edelgard
Edelgard: I knew when next we met one of our paths would have to come to an end. Your journey ends here, Professor. Forever...

%Dimitri,Edelgard
Dimitri: Stab your chest, break your neck, smash your head... I will allow you to choose your own death.
Edelgard: I'm not interested in methods of dying. All that matters is when death takes place, not how. And I have no intention of dying today.
Dimitri: I'm sure all of the people you've slaughtered so far thought the same!

@Boss
Edelgard: I lost?! Just as expected, you aren't making my path an easy one. I must retreat for now. We'll meet again on the battlefield.

@End 
Dimitri: So, you think you can escape, Edelgard?

Rodrigue: Your Highness! You're alive! We have to retreat to the Great Bridge of Myrddin...
Dimitri: That woman...we failed to capture her. I'll keep pursuing. The rest of you, keep fighting!
Rodrigue: I'm so sorry...but we can't do that. I understand how you feel, but the Imperial army is closing in!
Dimitri: I'll kill all of them! No matter how many hundreds or thousands of them they are!

Fleche: ...
Rodrigue: You... What are you doing here?! It's too dangerous! Fall back, now!
Fleche: Heh.

Rodrigue: Your Highness!
Dimitri: You...are...

Fleche: Have I caught you off guard, Your Highness? Aww, does it hurt? I bet it hurts reaaaal bad, doesn't it? But it's nothing compared to what my brother felt! You will never be forgiven, you know. I will never forgive you!
Dimitri: You... You must be...
Fleche: You filthy monster! It's time to DIIIIE!

Rodrigue: Dimitri!
Rodrigue: Gah... P-Professor... Do it now!

Fleche: Agahhhh! B-Brother... Help... me...

Dimitri: Rodrigue!
Rodrigue: Your Highness... Are you safe? Please tell me... it wasn't in vain...
Dimitri: This punishment... it was mine to bear.
Rodrigue: There are no sins or punishments... on the battlefield...
Dimitri: NO! Don't die... Please, don't die! Father, Stepmother, Glenn... They all died and left me behind. Rodrigue... Are you to join the ghosts who shadow my every move? This is my fault... I... I'm the one who killed you, as surely as though I had wielded the blade!
Rodrigue: Heh. Your Highness. You have one thing... terribly wrong. None of them... none of us... died for you. I'm dying for what I believe in... just as they did. Your life is your own. It belongs to no other, living or dead. Live for what you believe in. Dimitri... My boy... You really do look just like His Majesty...

Rodrigue: What are you saying, Lambert?!
Lambert: I am heading to Duscur. And before you start, nothing you could say would change my mind. You worry too much, my friend. So far relations with Duscur have been going smoothly, wouldn't you say? You of all people should appreciate how critical these negotiations are.
Rodrigue: Of course I do, but... for the king himself to make the journey... You must admit that it's dangerous. And His Highness is still so young. If the worst should happen...
Lambert: Even if the worst should happen, he would be OK. He's a smart boy, Rodrigue. Even if he should lose his father, I have no doubt that he will grow to be a good and respectable man.
Rodrigue: Lambert...
Lambert: However... If he ever starts down the wrong path and I am not here to set him straight, I am trusting you to do so in my stead, old friend. Promise me.

Rodrigue: Lambert... My promise... I...

@Dialogue 
Dimitri: What do you want?
Byleth: Where are you going?
Dimitri: It doesn't concern you.
Byleth: It does.
Dimitri: Get out of my way. Now.
Byleth: You're going to Enbarr, aren't you?
Dimitri: ...
Byleth: Do you really think that will appease the dead?
Dimitri: Silence. You have no idea what you're talking about. Death is the end. No matter how much lingering regret a person has, after death, they are powerless. They cannot even wish for revenge, much less seek it out. Hatred. Regret. Those burdens fall on the shoulders of those who are left behind. And so I must continue down this path! I already told you as much! It is far too late to stop.
Byleth: You're wrong.
Byleth: There must be another way.
Dimitri: Do not waste your breath with some nonsense about how I should move on with my life for their sake. That is merely the logic of the living. It's meaningless. Those who died with lingering regret... They will not loose their hold on me so easily. 
Dimitri: But you seem to have all the answers... So tell me, professor. Please, tell me... How do I silence their desperate pleas? How do I... How do I save them? 
Dimitri: Ever since that day nine years ago... I have lived only to avenge the fallen. Even my time at the Officers Academy was all so that I could secure my revenge and clear away the regret of the dead. It was the only thing that kept me alive... My only reason to keep moving forward...
Byleth: You must forgive yourself.
Byleth: You've suffered enough.
Dimitri: Hmph.
Dimitri: But then who... or what... should I live for?
Byleth: Live for what you believe in.
Dimitri: What I believe in... Rodrigue said the same thing. But is it possible... I am a murderous monster. My hands are stained red. Could one such as I truly hope for such a life? As the sole survivor of that day, do I... Do I have the right to live for myself?
Dimitri: ...
Dimitri: Your hands are so warm... Have they always been?
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Prince Dimitri and the remnants of the royal family join with the remaining Knights of Seiros to form a revitalized Kingdom army. Using Garreg Mach as their base of operations, they rise to action against the Empire.

@Dialogue 
Seteth: You! So, you were alive after all.
Flayn: Professor! It is so good to see you again. My brother and I were worried about you.
Alois: Ah, thank the goddess... I couldn't bear the thought of letting Jeralt down by not finding you.
Shamir: Guess you lucked out.
Catherine: We've been looking everywhere for you! But...I see Lady Rhea isn't with you. Damn.
Cyril: Everyone was real worried about you, Professor.
Hanneman: Gilbert has told us everything. From here on, our strength is yours as well.
 Manuela: Gilbert told us everything. We'll help you out however we can, of course.
 Knight of Seiros: Gilbert told us everything. We are at your disposal!
Gilbert: It does my heart well to see that all of you are safe. Now that we have all gathered, let's discuss our next course of action.


Seteth: We have two objectives...to overthrow the Empire and to rescue Rhea. I have no objections to joining forces with you. After all, our interests are aligned.
Gilbert: Nothing could be more reassuring than securing the cooperation of the Knights of Seiros.
Byleth: Thank you.
Byleth: Let's fight together.
Seteth: The archbishop entrusted all of her affairs to you. From now on, I shall comply with your wishes.
Gilbert: We'll make Garreg Mach our base, and prepare to make our stand against the Empire. There is a fair amount of damage, but we will at least have shelter from the wind and rain.
Catherine: Surely those Imperial jerks have this place staked out, right? It's a highly strategic location.
Gilbert: While it may be a strategic location, it's too far from the front lines to be worthy of notice at the moment. This area is inconvenient as far as transport time is concerned, so it's of little importance to their war effort.
Seteth: Even so, nothing slips past the emperor. It is safe to assume she at least has this place under surveillance.
Gilbert: Professor... What do you think about making this place our base?
Byleth: I have no objections.
Byleth: Gathering resources would be difficult.
Gilbert: Yes, that is a valid concern...
Gilbert: Fortunately, there are still villages and hamlets nearby. And though I wouldn't call them abundant, we have war funds, as well. What do you think, Your Highness?
Dimitri: Do as you please.
Annette: Hey! Don't act like this doesn't concern you! We finally reunited after all this time... We've got to work together!
Sylvain: She's right. In fact, why don't we all join forces and clean this place up a bit?
Annette: Ooh, yeah! That's a great idea! And it'll give us time to reminisce about all the good old days at the academy. I can't wait!
Dimitri: How carefree of you.
Ashe: It may sound trivial, but... Well, I think it's a good idea...
Gilbert: I understand feeling impatient, Your Highness. But patience is key at a time like this. If we fix up our base, it will improve morale, which will be sorely needed as weâ
Dimitri: Fools.
Byleth: Let's all settle down.
Byleth: Let's all get along.
Dimitri: Stay out of this.
Gilbert: Please calm yourself, Your Highness. We are not your enemies.
Dimitri: My enemies say the same.

Felix: What happened to him? It's like he's a completely different person.
Mercedes: I feel so bad for him... Would it help if I brewed him a nice pot of tea?
Gilbert: I cannot claim to understand how he feels. However... The way he's behavingâit's as though he's being haunted by some unseen force.
Byleth: I'm worried.
Gilbert: As am I.
Byleth: He wasn't always like this.
Gilbert: Perhaps...

@Conversation 
Dimitri: ...



Felix: Hello. I have a request concerning that...creature. I can hardly look at the thing in the state it's in. Do something about it.
Byleth: I'll see what I can do. 
Felix: Please do.
Byleth: I don't think I can.
Felix: Don't just give up like that.
Byleth: Better to just leave him alone.
Felix: Don't just give up like that.
Felix: We tracked the boar for five years. I thought he was dead. In the state he's in, he might as well be. He's gotten better at killing people, and in exchange, surrendered what little humanity he had.



Ashe: Is...is Dedue really gone? There's so much more I wanted to say to him. He was always so tender with the flowers in the greenhouse. I wonder how they're doing...




Sylvain: Hey, Professor. It's been a while. It's really good to see you again. Gorgeous as ever, might I add. An awful lot has happened in these past five years. There were so many times I wished you were around. I'm glad you're back. Your skills are worth more than a whole army.

Mercedes: I finally managed to meet up with everyone again, but they're all so gloomy. Hey, Professor. Care to join me for a cup of tea? We could invite the others, and the soldiers.
Byleth: That sounds nice. 
Mercedes: Doesn't it? There probably isn't enough time to bake any treats though...
Byleth: Um, I don't know...
Mercedes: Don't be like that, Professor. When things are tough, that's exactly when we need to keep our spirits up and smile!
Mercedes: Oh! I should invite Dimitri to come along as well. Though I don't suppose he'll want to join in...



Annette: Now that I think about it, His Highness was right. We probably don't have time to waste on cleaning... Maybe I wasn't taking the situation seriously enough. After all, the Imperial army could be showing up at any time! I was just so happy to see you again. And everyone else too. Maybe I got carried away.
Byleth: I'm happy to see you too. 
Annette: Oh really? That's so nice to hear!
Byleth: Cleaning is important.
Annette: Well, I suppose Lady Rhea would be pretty shocked if she came back to find the place filthy!



Ingrid: These past five years, many Kingdom houses have become vassals of the Empire. The major houses of Fraldarius, Gautier, Charon, and my own family, Galatea, remain loyal... But the lords of the minor domains in the west have almost entirely defected. After all the royal family has done for them, they respond with betrayal. And to think they have the gall to call themselves nobles. But we still have His Highness, and you, Professor. I'm sure we can take back the Kingdom's lands.



Ferdinand: I have lost my dominion. My nobility may seem like nothing more than a title. But I will never lose my noble heart. I will stop Edelgard, even if it costs me my life. I have turned my blade against her now. I cannot go back on that decision. Professor... Do you think I chose the wrong path?
Byleth: Not at all.
Byleth: We'll find out soon enough. 
Ferdinand: You are right...



Linhardt: The promise was made five years ago, but I must say I'm rather impressed by how many of us managed to make it. Personally, I only showed up because I hoped to see you again, Professor. I've been with my family in the Empire until recently. I admit to feeling a little guilty betraying Her Majesty...but only a little. Now that we're all together again, I suppose the fighting will begin soon.



Caspar: Hey, Professor! You won't believe what happened! I figured I couldn't go back to the Empire after Garreg Mach fell, so I started drifting across the Kingdom and the Alliance. Then I just happened to run into our old class, so we came back to the monastery together!

Bernadetta: Ah, at last, I return to my domain! My lonely paradise! My realm of exquisite solitude! Huh? Professor? Is that, um. Is that you? You, um. You didn't hear that just now, did you?
Byleth: Sorry.
Bernadetta: Oh! Forget you heard anything!
Byleth: Hear what? 
Bernadetta: Right. You didn't? Well, um. Good.



Dorothea: Laaa-la-laaa-la-laaa... Professor! Oh my! It's so good to see you. These days, so many old friends seem to be disappearing. But you... You're here! It's incredible to see you again after five years! I have a feeling your name will go down in history.



Petra: Edelgard is controlling the Empire. She is putting the pressure on the Kingdom and Alliance. Empire and religion are at open war. It will be...difficult for us at first. But corrupt nobles are many. That means that common people will rebel and be joining our side. With you, Professor, the battle tides will...ah, will turn. I have certainty.



Raphael: The Alliance is such a mess. How are we supposed to know where's safe and where's not? I should probably just move my little sis and grandpa to Garreg Mach. At least I could keep working on becoming a proper knight without having to worry about them! I gotta find them a house once things calm down a bit!



Ignatz: Oh, Professor! Seeing everyone together again, it's like I'm in a dream. I feel like it's time for me to forge my own path and find my own place in this world.
Byleth: What about your family? Are they OK?
Ignatz: Yes. They're in the Alliance, but they're merchants, so they have the means to escape if need be.
Byleth: How does your father feel about all this? 
Ignatz: I sent him a letter. I'm still waiting on a reply, but I don't think he'd object to my being here. It'll be valuable for him, having someone outside the Alliance to keep him abreast of new information.



Lysithea: I should probably keep things to myself, but in all honesty... What matters to me, more than anything, is ensuring a peaceful, quiet future for my parents. I don't care about the Kingdom. I simply want to remove the threat of the Empire. Because of this, Dimitri's fixation on Edelgard is convenient to me. I fight for my own reasons and no others.



Marianne: Professor... Is there any reason for me to remain here? I want to be useful, of course, but I'm not sure anyone needs me.
Byleth: Then why did you stay?
Marianne: That was my adoptive father's decision. He has decided there is no future in the Alliance...
Byleth: I need you here. 
Marianne: If you really mean that, I will stay and do my best to help.



Hilda: Garreg Mach is a mess. So is Dimitri, honestly. If not for you arriving, Professor, I'd be heading home about now. Though staying here is still more appealing than living with my big brother.



Leonie: I'm so glad I found you here, Professor. Now I don't have to worry about what to do with myself. Captain Jeralt told me to look out for you, after all. So now my purpose is clear. I'll do everything I can to protect you!



Seteth: Five long years, I've searched for you and the archbishop. It is a pleasure to see you again. The Church of Seiros will follow you from now on, but please do not abandon the search for Lady Rhea.
Byleth: We'll do whatever it takes to find her. 
Seteth: Thank you. I know the battles ahead will be dire, but we will support you with all our strength.
Byleth: We don't know what the future will bring.
Seteth: Wherever she is, Rhea is doubtlessly waiting for you. Please do not let her down.



Flayn: Professor, I am so glad you are unharmed! No matter the path you walk, I will be with you every step of the way. Anything you ask of me, I shall see it through. You saved my life, and I am in your debt.



Hanneman: Thankfully, it appears the records and equipment I need for my research have not been damaged. I am most curious though. You say you were asleep for five whole years? Incredible. Perhaps this is another effect of your Crest. I do look forward to investigating you in greater detail.
Byleth: We can talk about that. 
Hanneman: Wonderful news! I am most excited to begin. We must find the time, of course.
Byleth: Uh, maybe later...
Hanneman: I'll have to be content with observing you wherever you go, then. I cannot waste any opportunity!



Manuela: My, Professor. You haven't changed a bit! At your age, I'd expect your whole demeanor to have changed greatly over five years... Though I suppose I haven't changed either, right? Thank you for noticing, by the way. Ah, just the two of us, forever young.  Oh, let me have my fun.



Gilbert: We have given a proper burial to the Imperial soldiers kills in the monastery. The ones who were sent to investigate the thieves. Already, rumors spread that they were utterly annihilated. So regardless of whether there are spies observing us, the Imperial army will know of this soon enough. Your Highness...Dimitri... How could you be so reckless?



Alois: I'd given up on seeing you again. Where have you been hiding? Anyway, now that we're reunited in the land of the living, I must fulfill my promise!
Byleth: What promise?
Alois: The promise I made to the captain, to keep you safe! I can't believe you've forgotten. How cold...
Byleth: Right, the promise. 
Alois: That's right. I promised the captain I'd protect you in his stead, and now I'll make good on my word!



Catherine: In Lady Rhea's absence, I will follow you. That's what she would want me to do. Know that wherever you might lead us, I'll continue searching for Lady Rhea.
Byleth: That's fine. 
Catherine: Good, because I will not budge on that point. Welcome back, Professor.
Byleth: Sounds like a lot of trouble.
Catherine: I don't care how much trouble it is! I will rescue Lady Rhea, at all costs.



Shamir: I'm more of a mercenary than a knight these days. I work to get paid. I never was too attached to FÃ³dlan. I was considering leaving soon... But I might change my mind if you're around.



Cyril: I don't know anything about rebuilding, but I can sure do my best to clean up the mess. I'm gonna keep Lady Rhea's room spotless, so she can use it right away whenever she gets back.



Anna: There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! You know, it's such a thrill to be able to greet you like this again! I almost died as well in the battle five years ago, but I won't allow any enemies to get into this place again. I promise you that! Even if the Death Knight shows up, I'll be sure to... Well, for now I'll keep training so I can eventually feel confident that I can stop him!

@Intro 
Dimitri: You're wrong.
Byleth: ...
Dimitri: It's not like that, Glenn. I swear it. Any love I once had for my stepsister...has been tossed aside. Only hatred remains. If I could tear that woman to shreds right this very moment, I would. I don't care if she's the emperor. It's no different than killing anyone else. So I beg you...all of you... Do not worry about my resolve. Please, Father... And you too, Stepmother... Do not gaze at me with that look in your eyes... I will bring you her head soon. And when I do, you may finally rest in peace. I know it... Yes, I know it...
Byleth: Snap out of it, Dimitri.
Byleth: What is troubling you?
Dimitri: What do you want?
Byleth: I came to check on you.
Byleth: Everyone is worried about you.
Dimitri: I see. We should make haste and prepare to move out at once. I must kill her as soon as possible...
Byleth: That would be rash.
Dimitri:  I don't have time to leisurely set up camp like the rest of you fools!
Byleth: We must first prepare.
Dimitri:  We have no time to leisurely set up camp. If I must, I will go by myself.
Gilbert: Pardon the interruption. We must prepare a counterattack at once. The Imperial army has caught wind of our position. It would seem they were patrolling this place, after all.
Dimitri: The Imperial army, is it? Well, well. Hehehe...
Gilbert: Your Highness... I ask that you please refrain from reckless behavior in battle.

Randolph: It would seem the report that the Knights of Seiros have returned was accurate. This is going to take some effort.
Fleche: Brother... I heard a rumor that there is a vicious murderer among our enemies.
Randolph: Who knows if there's any truth to it. Thought I admit we have lost some soldiers recently. Whether he's among them or not, taking on the Knights of Seiros is extremely dangerous. You're not ready for the front lines, Fleche. Stay in the back and support us from there. Understood?
Fleche: No! I want to stay with you! I have toâ
Randolph: I need you to understand, Fleche. I will come back. I promise.
Fleche: Fine. I trust you, Brother. Please...be safe.
Randolph: All units, prepare to attack!

@Opening 
At the monastery at Garreg Mach, the Kingdom army proceeds to bolster its forces, but the Empire is already one step ahead. An Imperial vanguard, led by General Randolph, has deduced the location of the Kingdom army and now advances with the aim of toppling Garreg Mach for a second time.

Fulfilling a promise made five years ago, your former students gather once more at the monastery, as do the knights. However, your joyful reunion is cut short...

@Battle 
Randolph: The Knights of Seiros are a powerful enemy, but we have more soldiers. We'll take them down all at once!
Gilbert: There are more enemies than expected. Attacking with fire would prove most useful here.

Knight of Seiros: Report! The enemy has entered the periphery of Garreg Mach!
Gilbert: If they reach the interior, we won't be able to protect the monastery. Drive them back!


Gilbert: It is our duty to give these soldiers to their destination. Stay alert. An attack may come at any time.

Gilbert: Damn! We couldn't protect the monastery. We must accept defeat.

Randolph: A total loss... But we can't just return home like this...
Dimitri: Professor! Get down!


Gilbert: The fire attack unit has been destroyed. Our plan has failed.
Randolph: It looks like they were planning something, but it failed!

Gilbert: Fire attack is ready. Now to draw the enemy's attention. So many units, and you still can't defeat us... The Empire's generals are not as formidable as I'd heard.
Randolph: Quiet! Don't think you'll get away with mocking me! Attack! Make sure they never speak again!
Gilbert: Now!

Imperial soldier: Fire! Gyaaaaaah!
Randolph: Argh, a fire attack... The damage is too great. We can't fight anymore! All units, retreat! I'll take on our pursuers! Carry away the injured soldiers!


Gilbert: Chase them down! Leave none standing. Eliminate them before they can regroup.

@Boss 
Randolph: For my house! For justice! I will not be defeated!

Randolph: No... This can't end here...
Dimitri: Capture him.

%Dimitri,Randolph
Randolph: A one-eyed demon... So, it's you. You're the one who's been going around killing the Imperial troops!
Dimitri: What is it to you?
Randolph: You bastard! Life is worthless to you, isn't it?!
Dimitri: Ha! You took the words from my mouth, general!

%Caspar,Randolph
Caspar: You must be Randolph... My uncle.
Randolph: Caspar?! Yes, indeed... So, I see you have chosen to oppose the Empire. If so, be warned that I won't hesitate. I'll strike you down, even if we're of the same house!
Caspar: You took the words right outta my mouth! Graaagh!

@End 
Gilbert: A terrible battle, yet Garreg Mach still stands. Your Highness?

Randolph: I have family waiting for me... Please. I can't die here...
Dimitri: A beast of your depravity, prattling on about family? How amusing.
Randolph: As though you could understand...such a thing as love... You heartless monster!
Dimitri: You are a monster too, General. You have just yet to realize it. A monster who thinks he's a man...despicable. As a general, you must have killed countless souls without a shred of mercy. Do you still remember the sound of them begging, just as you're begging now? Or, now that your life is at its end, will you hold to the lie that your hands are not stained red with blood?
Randolph: This...this is war. I did what I had to for the Empire...for the people...for my family!
Dimitri: So, you are piling up corpses for the people and for your family. And I am doing the same for the salvation of the dead... After all is said and done, we are both murderers. Both stained. Both monsters.
Randolph: You're wrong!
Dimitri: Am I? I can smell the rotting flesh upon your hands even now, General.
Randolph: Enough! That's enough!
Dimitri: I won't kill you right away, my fellow monster. Unless you object to watching your friends die. One...by...one. If so, I will do you the service of removing your eyes first so thatâ

Randolph: Gaaah! Fleche... Please, forgive me...

Dimitri: ... What is the meaning of this?
Byleth: I couldn't bear to watch.
Dimitri: Hah...hahahaha! A grievous error, Professor!
Byleth: I miss the Dimitri I once knew.
Dimitri: The Dimitri you once knew is dead. All that remains is the repulsive, blood-stained monster you see before you.
Dimitri: If you do not approve of what I have become, then kill me. If you insist that you cannot...then I will continue to use you and your friends until the flesh falls from your bones.

Gilbert: We managed to repel the Imperial army, but we remain divided on our next course of action. I anticipate a second and third wave of attack... With our current forces, we'll have our hands full just defending.
Sylvain: It's a miracle we managed to repel the Imperial army with the few units and resources we do have.
Annette: We should probably contact Rodrigue right away to request backup.
Gilbert: Rodrigue is in a difficult position, as he has suffered invasions by the Dukedom. But there are troops who share in our cause gathering the heart of Fraldarius territory. If we can arrange for them to join us, our forces will grow considerably.
Dimitri: Fraldarius... So, Rodrigue is still alive, is he?
Byleth: We met five years ago.
Dimitri: So you did.
Byleth: That name sounds familiar.
Dimitri: You met Rodrigue when he visited the monastery during Miklan's rebellion.
Felix: I wonder what my old man will say when he sees you now. That spectacle alone will be worth the trip.
Dimitri: Hmph.
Gilbert: I've already sent word with our fastest messenger informing Rodrigue that His Highness is alive. But we'd do well to send another in case anything happens to the first. With the current state of things, we'll be completely helpless without his support. Your Highness, may I ask what your next plan of attack is? Should we dispatch our troops to the Kingdom capital or to the Imperial capital?
Dimitri: We will take the Imperial capital. There, I will kill her. We end the war and chase away the lingering regrets of the dead. Nothing could be more to the point.
Annette: Uh, that may be true, but don't forget that your people need our help right now...
Ingrid: Your Highness... I hate them too. But the citizens of Fhirdiad have long awaited your return.
Sylvain: Just give it up already. Wasting time thinking about stuff like that will only dull your blade.
Ashe: Defeating Edelgard would put an end to the war. That would benefit the Kingdom as well...
Mercedes: We still need to look for Lady Rhea, so I agree that we should get to Enbarr as fast as possible.
Seteth: Professor... Whatever you decide, we shall follow.
Byleth: Let's take back Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital.
Dimitri: You were entrusted with leading the church. One would think the logical step is to march to Enbarr. If Lady Rhea is being held prisoner in the Empire, we don't have time to waste taking back Fhirdiad. Can you deny it?
Byleth: ...
Byleth: Let's take down Enbarr, the Imperial Capital.
Dimitri: Yes... It is the only way.
Gilbert: Either way, we are in need of numbers. It is essential that we secure backup.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
The Kingdom Army has reclaimed the kingdom capital and plans to immediately begin restoring the country and its forces. But an unexpected request arrives from Claude, leader of the Leicester Alliance. Dimitri promptly responds to the request for aid, and he rushes to prepare the kingdom's forces.

Having allowed the Imperial army to invade, the Alliance army makes their last stand at the center of House Riegan territory in Derdriu. The Kingdom army rushes to their aid after amassing more troops.

@Dialogue 
Dimitri: We have received a request for aid from the Alliance. They are being invaded by the Empire. We have only just taken back Fhirdiad, and yet I am already asking all of you to move out once more. Please accept my apologies for that.
Ingrid: That's no problem at all. More importantly, how is the Alliance faring?
Dimitri: House Riegan has rallied the Alliance Lords. They are facing the enemy with all the strength they can muster. But we do not know how far that will get them. It seems the enemy's relentless attacks have forced them into a tough situation. Their defeat at Gronder severely weakened the Alliance. I imagine the Empire now intends to destroy them before they can recover.
Gilbert: To think they'd watch us chase their soldiers out of the kingdom capital, then immediately go invade the Alliance... Their general is Lord Volkhard von Arundel. He serves as regent to the Emperor. He has presumably taken command after the Emperor was wounded in Gronder.
Dimitri: He is known for his shrewdness and excels not only in domestic affairs, but tactics as well. He is not an opponent we should take lightly. Lord Arundel...
Byleth: Are you concerned?
Dimitri: I always suspected that Lord Arundel was behind the tragedy nine years ago. The timing of his departure from the kingdom, the fact that he abruptly stopped making donations... Too many factors made him suspect. If Lord Arundel conspired with Cornelia... then what Kronya and the others said five years ago...
Gilbert: Hmm...
Dimitri: Well, nevermind that for now. The Alliance needs our help. What are your thoughts?
Gilbert: If we turn our back on the Alliance and then Derdriu falls, it will undoubtedly make our situation difficult further down the road. We would have enemies in two directions... in the Alliance to the northeast and in the Empire to the south.
Dimitri: That is true. In that scenario, we would not be able to safely march our soldiers to Enbarr.
Flayn: I'm terribly worried about Lady Rhea... but I believe we must save the Alliance first.
Annette: Oh! Maybe if we do this, the Alliance will help us out in return! We could ask them to help us attack the Empire. You know, a sneak attack or something!
Mercedes: Annie! When did you become so devious?
Gilbert: Heh. What would your mother think.
Annette: What? It wasn't that devious!
Gilbert: What do you think, professor?
Byleth: Let's march for Derdriu.
Dimitri: Yes, I agree.
Byleth: I support whatever Dimitri decides.
Dimitri: We must go to Derdriu.
Dimitri: I will admit that there is something to be gained for us as well, for when we eventually march south... But far more importantly... they need us. We cannot turn our backs on them.

Dimitri: We will arrange to head out at once. Prepare yourselves, everyone.

@Conversation 
Dimitri: it was over 20 years ago... There was an illness raging across Fhirdiad. While people were dying left and right...it was Cornelia who saved the Kingdom from that dreadful illness.
Byleth: I can't imagine it...
Dimitri: Neither can I. By the time I was old enough to understand, that time had already passed.
Byleth: Cornelia was a doctor?
Dimitri: No, I her she was originally an Imperial scholar. She was in the Kingdom by my father's invitation.
Dimitri: People praised Cornelia as a saint for ending the epidemic. But there came a day when she completely changed. Her behavior, mannerisms, likes, dislikes...everything. Despite all that, Father still appointed her to a high post. After all, she had saved the Kingdom from ruin by that disease... But above all, my stepmother trusted her. That's why what that woman said is... Never mind.



Dedue: Lord Rodrigue Fraldarius has passed on. Margrave Gautier has assumed his position, and is now gathering the lords of the eastern territories. House Gautier is equal in prestige to House Fraldarius. Sylvain is a Gautier. These lords are reorganizing the Faerghus army, and eradicating any remaining factions that claim allegiance to the Empire. Of course, His Highness is being kept appraised with regular reports. But it falls to me to monitor him, and ensure he does not try to take on too much. I would ask you to do the same. If you take your eyes off that man, even for a moment, he is liable to do something rash.







Ashe: The very same night we liberated the capital, a messenger arrived from Derdriu. Claude must have predicted that we'd retake it.
Byleth: Definitely.  
Byleth: Could have been a coincidence.
Ashe: No, I don't think so. It takes too long to travel to Fhirdiad from Derdriu for it to be chance.
Ashe: Claude's a hard person to read. It's obvious not much escapes his eye though. Kind of unsettling, honestly.



Sylvain: Derdriu, the Aquatic Capital... I've heard it's a magnificent city, you know. If we're going, I wish it wasn't to wage war. It'd be more fun to visit with a cute girl on my arm.
Byleth: Maybe once the war is over... 
 Sylvain: You're right. That's something to look forward to.
 Sylvain: Yeah? Maybe you and me? That'd be a good reason to survive the war. Heh heh...
Byleth: Forget it.
Sylvain: Aw, come on. let a guy dream.



Mercedes: I went to visit my adoptive father at his home in the capital. He used to grovel at Cornelia's feet when the city was under her control. But after it was liberated, he started courting the Kingdom instead.
Byleth: Whatever it takes to get ahead.
Mercedes: I suppose he was just doing what he needed to survive...
Byleth: That's despicable. 
Mercedes: Absolutely. He's hopeless. I suppose when you're a merchant, that's all you know.
Mercedes: No matter what becomes of the world, it'll always be plagued by people like him.



Annette: Derdriu, huh? I've always wanted to go there. In Faerghus, most of the towns are pretty much glorified fortresses. So to hear about a place called the Aquatic capital... it just sounds so elegant! When the war's over, I hope I can visit with everyone there!



Ingrid: So, House Riegan has regained its influence in the Alliance and is gathering forces. Claude always was somewhat inscrutable. It's strange somehow to hear talk of his brilliance as the leader of the Alliance.



Ferdinand: I have been wondering something... If I had not been your student, where would I be right now? Who would I be? Do you ever think about that sort of thing, Professor?
Byleth: Like what if I had led a different class?
Ferdinand: Ah, so you do think about such questions. You can never find answers though, right? We cannot turn back time, so there is no way to back and try a different path.
Byleth: Like what if I had allied with the Empire? 
Ferdinand: Ah, so you do think about such questions. You can never find answers though, right? We cannot turn back time, so there is no way to back and try a different path.
Byleth: No, I don't.
Ferdinand: I see... You are so focused and coolheaded. I wish I could be more like you.



Linhardt: Traveling to the Empire, to the Kingdom, and then off to Alliance territory... Everyone certainly is busy. Perhaps it's not a bad thing now that I think about it.
Byleth: It's all in the pursuit of peace.
Linhardt: Peace will be lovely. Peace will, one assumes, be considerably less perilous.
Byleth: Yes, very busy. 
Linhardt: If only we were only busy, then I think I would be fine. I'd be able to take a nap for one. But If I napped now, I suspect that I soon enough I'd find myself busy dying...



Caspar: Didn't they used to call Claude the Master Tactician? I want a nickname too! Maybe I'll get one if I can rescue him at Derdriu... I'll come up with a plan that's even better than his and earn a nickname for sure!

Bernadetta: Claude... Claude... Which one was he again? Oh! Right. Yeah, of course I remember him. It's just... I can't picture his face. Don't remember what he looks like. I'm not sure if I ever knew.



Dorothea: Dimitri is going to Claude's aid. How great is that? It's like we've gone back to how things were five years ago. It's so nice. Just imagine if Edie was there too? I suppose you can't ever really go back to the way things were in the past...



Petra: I am being told you can see the sea from Derdriu. Not just see...that it is right there in front of you. In Brigid, the sea has great closeness. I would be looking at it every day. But in Garreg Mach, we cannot look at the sea. So I am feeling...drawn to Derdriu.
Byleth: The ocean is frightening. 
Petra: That is true. The ghosts of the sea have vengeance in their hearts. If they are wanting to take you, you cannot be saved.
Byleth: The sea is beautiful.
Petra: Yes, I think the sea has much beauty. But can also be frightening.



Lorenz: It seems Dimitri has become downright charitable. But I believe he is operating under a serious misapprehension. It may appear as if Claude is appealing to Dimitri for aid, but that is not what is happening here.
Byleth: Another one of Claude's tricks?
Lorenz: That's not it either. I see it got by you as well.
Byleth: Did he not actually ask for help?
Lorenz: That's not it either. I see it got by you as well.
Byleth: Is there another interpretation? 
Lorenz: Yes. A fine example of how snap decisions based on mere appearances can lead to gross misunderstandings.
Lorenz: Claude has asked for reinforcements from here because he knows I am here. Simply put, he is not throwing himself on Dimitri's mercy. He is throwing himself on mine. I suppose there is nothing else for it, is there? We cannot turn our backs on those in need. Let us grant him the aid he requires.



Raphael: We're going to go help Claude? I haven't seen him in forever. Wonder how he's been... I chose this side because I believe in you, Professor. But it's not like I got anything against Claude.
Byleth: What was he like?
Raphael: Hmm... Well, he loved parties, and he was full of some pretty good jokes!
Byleth: Were you close? 
Raphael: Of course! Claude was the kinda person who would be instantly friends with anyone.
Raphael: I got no clue what'll happen to the Alliance, but I sure hope Claude doesn't die...



Ignatz: So, war finally comes to the Alliance territories. I don't mean that there's never been fighting on Alliance soil, of course. There have been countless skirmishes between neighboring lords, as well as conflicts with Almyra. But this is an invasion by an army of the Empire. It's a whole different animal. I don't want to see my family get dragged into this... I hope we can drive back the Empire.



Lysithea: The pro-Imperialist lords who've let the Empire in have their hands tied. Houses Ordelia and Gloucester are exposed and likely caught off guard. That must mean that Claude's allies are...
Byleth: Duke Goneril.
Lysithea: Geographically, it would be hard for him to commit his forces, and logically, it wouldn't make sense for him to offer support.
Byleth: Margrave Edmund.
Lysithea: Margrave Edmund does not commit troops as easily as he commits funds, so that's doubtful.
Byleth: Count Daphnel. 
Lysithea: Without a doubt she is providing reinforcements. She has always supported Claude.
Lysithea: Whatever the situation, Claude's military strength is lacking, and what's more, they suffered casualties at Gronder Field. I don't know how long the Alliance forces will be able to hold out against the Empire. We've got to move quickly or we may be too late.



Marianne: I'm glad Dimitri and Claude don't have to fight one another... I am the daughter of an Alliance lord though, so I suppose that goes without saying. Having to fight with your former classmates is just so terribly sad...



Hilda: We took Fhirdiad back, but I never found the time to go shopping there! When the war's over and the city is revitalized, I'd like to visit again. Will you come with me, Professor?
Byleth: All right. 
Hilda: Really? Oh, I'm so glad! Although I suppose we have bigger things on our plate, like...
Byleth: Shouldn't we be more worried about... 
Hilda: Claude! He's in big trouble. I bet my family is too. We have to help them, Professor! I know we can't lose with you on our side!



Leonie: Guess this doesn't end with liberating the Kingdom capital. Derdriu is next. That prince really works his people hard, doesn't he? Or should I be calling him a king now? Whatever the title is, he'll always be Dimitri to me.



Seteth: I thought there was a chance that Cornelia had captured Lady Rhea, but it seems that is not the case. Our next foe, Lord Arundel, was once a pious adherent to the Seiros creed. His contributions to the church stopped quite abruptly some time ago. I think it is likely the man knows something.



Flayn: You plan to aid Claude, do you not? I think that is absolutely marvelous. Being opposing forces at the battle of Gronder was ill fated. It hurts to side against him. I am happy that things have taken a brighter turn now.



Hanneman: Cornelia Arnim... That's a familiar name, yes. She once studied in the Empire. My understanding is, shortly after I left the Empire, she did as well. Unlike myself, Cornelia traveled to the Kingdom. Apparently she halted a plague, and was rewarded with a quite powerful appointment. That such a an outstanding researcher should fall to such depravity... Sickening, Professor. And quite sad.



Manuela: Remember the Death Knight who stabbed me five years ago? Of course you do. How could you forget? Well, it turns out he's a general in the Imperial army, claiming victory on dozens of battlefields. But it looks like he's not at Derdriu. Like every man in my life, he's run away from me... And he better run! One day, I'm gonna find that guy and pay him back for what he did to me!



Gilbert: With the capital recaptured. I desire to call him Your Majesty rather than Your Highness. He would refuse my desire, rightfully pointing out that he has not, as yet, been crowned. However, the day this war has ended, and the church has placed the crown upon his head... Then, he will truly be our king, and I will call him Your Majesty at last. I must go hear the reports from our spies. There is something worrying me andâNo. I can wait. I shall tell you more when our information is more concrete.



Alois: I was getting excited for our big Empire showdown! I spent so much time mentally preparing. Then we shifted focus to Derdriu. I hadn't been expecting that. But, as a knight who's sworn to serve the goddess, I cannot turn a blind ear to those who seek my aid.



Catherine: We're still searching for Lady Rhea. No news on that, I'm afraid. Lord Arundel, the emperor's uncle, is the regent of the Empire. If we crush them at Derdriu, maybe we'll capture him and wring some clues out of him.



Shamir: Claude, eh? He always was sharp among his peers. Never let himself get caught up in conventions. He wasn't typical in FÃ³dlan. I'd like to save him if we can.
Byleth: We'll make it in time.
Shamir: I know. And I'm sure he's already calculated exactly when that will be.
Byleth: He's too determined to die. 
Shamir: Heh. You may be right.



Cyril: Ugh, even if we do enter Alliance territory, we're not gonna find Lady Rhea there. I wish we could leave Claude be and go attack the Empire. I suppose if we can't beat the Empire forces here, then we can't get into the Empire lands, can we? I guess that means it's just hard work time, huh, Professor?



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Derdriu is known as the Aquatic capital... It's a beautiful town with streets that seem to float on the water and an impressive harbor. In times of peace, it would be a wonderful place for a holiday... Anyway! Best of luck in the next battle!

@Intro 
Alliance Soldier 1: The citizens of Derdriu have all been evacuated and are now at sea! Are you sure about this? If Derdriu were to fall, those ships don't have enough resources for --
Claude: Derdriu won't fall. Have some faith in me, will you?
Alliance Soldier 1: Oh! Yes, sir!

Alliance Soldier 2: Our line of defense has been broken! The Imperial army will be here any moment!
Claude: Understood. You two join up with the troops in the city.
Alliance Soldier 2: Yes, sir! 
Claude: Judith, are you ready?
Judith: As ready as I'll ever be. It's been years since I last battled in the city streets.
Claude: Don't go messing up because your vision has weakened with age. Take the defensive for now.
Judith: Yeah, yeah, I get it. You hang in there, too, boy. Your wounds from Gronder Field haven't fully healed yet, have they?
Claude: No, but it's not like I can sit this one out. I have to make my daring escape, after all. And for the last time, stop calling me boy! That's an official order from the leader of the Alliance.
Judith: Understood, Leader Man. I wonder if our little ray of hope will show up... We fought on opposite sides at Gronder, didn't we?
Claude: They'll come. You can count on it. If anyone can bring him back, it's Teach. Teach will talk, and he'll listen. But more than anything, I've their skill and abilities... I believe in them.

Alliance Soldier 3: Claude! Reinforcements are coming from the west! Their banner is that of the Kingdom...
Claude: What did I tell you? They're here. And just in time.



Gilbert: It appears the Imperial army has already marched into Derdriu and engaged the Alliance. It seems the Imperial advance has been stalled by guerrilla skirmishes. The Alliance forces are holding out, but they won't last much longer...
Ingrid: That must be Judith of House Daphnel who joined up with Claude's troops. To think Judith, a true hero, would find herself backed into a corner like this...
Dimitri: It is not so. The Alliance has only drawn the enemy so deeply into the city to allow us to attack them from behind. Brilliant.
Byleth: They're planning a pincer attack?
Dimitri: I believe so. He put his soldiers into position purely on the belief that we'd come... I can't believe Claude would risk everything on that behalf. He has placed all of his hopes on us. Let's make sure we live up to his expectations, Professor.

Dimitri: Here we go. Let's move!

@Opening 
Shortly after reclaiming the Kingdom capital, a request for aid arrives from Claude. To save the Alliance from ruin, you head to Derdriu, the Aquatic Capital.

@Battle 
Lord Arundel: The leader of the Alliance has managed to escape to the harbor, has he? Those rats resist in vain...
Imperial Soldier: Your Excellency! There's an army closing in on us from outside. The banners...are those of House Blaiddyd.
Lord Arundel: Blaiddyd? I see... That idiot failed, it seems. Hurry up and kill the leader of the Alliance. With him gone, Derdriu will fall.

Dimitri: I will not let Claude die... Let's hurry to his rescue.
Claude: Hey, you're late! Hurry up and help!

Gilbert: Look. The Imperial army's supply corps. Attacking them now would be a fine plan.


Imperial Soldier: The subjugation of Derdriu is complete. We will be joining the main army now!
Claude: Ugh... They're showing up one after another... Nothing for it but to blockade the gate leading to the town. I don't want the enemy's numbers to increase any more.


Hilda: Claude's nuts. Asking me to protect the bridge! That's so much responsibility. But the guy's so helpless, I feel sorry for him. So, I'll do what I can to protect him.

@Battle-Talk 
%Byleth,Hilda 
Hilda: Professor! It's been too long. I was hoping you'd show up. Seeing you puts a spring in my step! Come on, time to 'em the Hilda treatment!

@Battle 
Hilda: It's been fun, Claude... Sorry to go so soon...
Claude: Hilda! Why didn't you retreat?! I counted on you retreating...

Judith: It's no good...we're surrounded. But I need to hurry up and rescue the boy... To get to the harbor, first we have to get rid of the enemy mercenaries. There's no other way.

Judith: Thank you. That was a big help. I'll go and cover our leader!

Judith: I guess my vision really is going! I slipped up... Don't you get yourself killed out there, boy.
Claude: Judith! Stop calling me boy! I'm your leader... And I told you not to die...

Imperial Soldier: Now! Hidden soldiers, attack!


Claude: I missed that face! And you're just in time. Thanks for that. 

@Battle-Talk 
%Dimitri,Claude
Dimitri: You're OK... Can you still fight, Claude?
Claude: You barely snatch me from the jaws of death, and now you're recruiting me! You sure know how to inspire loyalty, Your Majesty. Sadly, I'm not free to move here, for many reasons. You'll have to repel the Empire without me...

%Byleth,Dimitri
Claude: Professor, if you had chosen me instead of Dimitri... No. I shouldn't dwell on it. I'm grateful you came. I'm glad to have your strength, if only for today. 

@Battle
Claude: My plan failed... Teach. Dimitri. That's enough. Time to retreat. I've crossed one too many bridges... It's a shame, but... It's over now...

@Boss
Lord Arundel: Clever. I can't believe they pushed through to here. Nothing is more foolish than dying in vain. Let's get to the harbor and finish off the leader of the Alliance! 

Lord Arundel: Nothing bites so hard as a cornered rat, eh?

%Dimitri,Lord Arundel
Lord Arundel: You would raise a weapon against your uncle? You've grown into a savage of a man, just like your father.
Dimitri: You are rather calm for one in your position. Or did you forget that this is a battlefield? Perhaps this is no time for words, Uncle. There will be time for that after we have settled things here.

@End 
Dimitri: Uncle, I need to know. The incident nine years ago ... You were involved, weren't you? You know something. What did Cornelia... No. What did my stepmother do?!
Lord Arundel: You are not qualified to look into the darkness... You and Edelgard... Do your best to kill each other... You are family, after all. There it is... the light...

Dimitri: He's dead. There goes our chance to gain more information. Then again, even if we had managed to capture him alive, judging by the way he was acting...
Byleth: For now, let's rejoice in our victory.
Byleth: We can think about that later.
Claude: Teach is absolutely right. We should take this rare opportunity to let off some tension.
Dimitri: It's been a long time, Claude. I am glad to see that you're safe.
Claude: Same. I haven't seen you since the nightmare that was Gronder. You really did come to help us... You must be a bunch of soft-hearted suckers, eh?
Dimitri: If you really felt that way, you would not have set up a defensive battle in the hopes that we would come. It worked out, only because we made it in time... Were you really so confident that we would answer the call?
Claude: Of course. I knew you wouldn't hesitate to put yourself second and come running to our aid.
Byleth: You know him well.
Byleth: How insightful.
Claude: You and I are cut from different cloth. I wouldn't make a move unless I could gain something from it. You've always been just the opposite. And of course, I've always been fond of taking dangerous risks. After all, I sent that express messenger before you had even recaptured the kingdom capital. If all went to plan, I knew you'd recapture it soon, and then respond to our request for aid. It was riskier than usual, I'll give you that. But it was the only card I had to play, so I took the gamble.
Dimitri: You cross too many dangerous bridges for my liking.
Claude: I know, I know. But... that ends today.
Dimitri: What do you mean?
Claude: Here, take this. Use it however you see fit.
Dimitri: The legendary bow, Failnaught... Isn't this the hero's relic of house Riegan? Hold, Claude. This must be one of your jokes. You cannot truly intend to part with this...
Claude: It's not a joke. As of today, the Leicester alliance is no more.
Dimitri: Just what are you planning, Claude?
Claude: If you're going to lead FÃ³dlan, then the alliance Lords will follow you. Back in the day, the Alliance split off from the kingdom. I'm just putting us back together again. Oh, and I've already gained the support of the other Lords at the roundtable conference, so you can stop looking at me like I'm crazy. All that's left for me is to officially step down as the leader of the Alliance.
Byleth: What will you do now? 
Byleth: Will you join our army?
Claude: Hold your horses there, Teach.
Claude: I'm leaving FÃ³dlan. There are things I have to do. Dreams I need to see to fruition. That's why I became the Alliance leader to begin with, actually. But it left me no time for what I was really after. You'd better not take on too many responsibilities yourselves, or else you'll end up in the same boat. And remember... both the living and the dead cling to us without any regard for our own lives. It's up to us to break free of that weight and follow the path that we believe in.
Dimitri: Claude...
Claude: Oops! I almost forgot the most important thing. If you're looking for Rhea, apparently she's being held captive in the imperial capital. It doesn't sound like they intend to kill her, but there's no telling what they're planning.
Dimitri: You have my gratitude, Claude.
Claude: Gratitude? Thanks but no thanks. As far as I'm concerned, we're even now. I don't know how many years will pass until then, but let's promise to meet again. And when we do... don't be too hard on me, your Kingliness.

Felix: Well, Dimitri? Are you finally going to tell us the damned truth?
Dimitri: What are you talking about?
Ashe: Didn't Lord Arundel say something about you and Edelgard being family?
Ingrid: To claim that the king and the emperor are related... Could it be?
Dimitri: Ah, I suppose I never told you, though I do recall mentioning it briefly to the professor... Lord Arundel spoke the truth. My stepmother was Edelgard's birth mother. Political turmoil drove my stepmother out of the Empire. Father fell in love with her at first sight and they married. I lost my birth mother before I was old enough to remember her. My stepmother filled that role for me. But she lost her life in Duscur nine years ago, along with Father.
Felix: Hang on, I didn't even know she was your stepmother. Did my father know about this?
Dimitri: Yes. All those who were close to my father knew, including Rodrigue. But to speak openly about it would have caused a scandal, and so she was our secret. No one in the general public knew about her. Naturally, the fact that Edelgard and I are stepsiblings was kept a secret as well.
Mercedes: I'm finally beginning to understand what you went through five years ago. I mean, Edelgard is the only family you have left, isn't she? To find out someone so precious to you is actually your most hated enemy... How heartbreaking.
Annette: But wait! You two were born and raised in two different territories, right? So you probably never met until you were both at the academy. I mean, don't get me wrong, I think the idea of fighting family is just about the worst thing ever. But hopefully the fact that she's a stepsister you never really knew helps with the pain... I don't know, it was just a thought.
Dimitri: I am afraid that's not the case. Though it was only for a short time, Edelgard once called Fhirdiad home. It was a long time ago, but she was a cherished friend of mine.
Sylvain: Wait! I remember now! She was that girl, wasn't she? The one you gave a dagger to! Heh, so your little girlfriend was Edelgard.
Dimitri: Sylvain. If you have any more foolish things to say, please hold them for later.
Sylvain: I do have a few more up my sleeve, but they can wait. Go on, Your Highness. This is important for us to hear.
Felix: She may be a hated enemy now, but the emperor is your old friend and stepsister. Can you bring yourself to kill her?
Dimitri: I will kill her... if I must. But if there is any chance that the world she seeks to create could be a just one... Then I... I would love to see a future in which I may reach out my hand for her and have her reach back. That said, I have no intention of letting my personal feelings cloud my judgment. Too much is at stake.
Ashe: Your Highness... I think you should meet with the emperor and at least try to talk to her. If there's any hope of ending this war without more bloodshed, we have to try. Besides, killing your own family... I'm sorry, but it's not right.
Dimitri: I...I think so too. And you are right that we should at least try.


Edelgard: I see. So my uncle's defeat is beyond doubt?
Hubert: Yes, Your Majesty. I have confirmed it via countless channels. I advise that we accept this as a drop of joy amid a pool of sorrow.
Edelgard: Pretty words, but I'm afraid we can't rest until the joy outweighs the sorrow. And for that to happen, it now seems we must confront them all at once. Dimitri, who took back Fhirdiad... Claude, who managed to protect the Alliance...And that professor, who is successfully mobilizing the Knights of Seiros...
Hubert: What will you do, Your Majesty?
Edelgard: Pull back our forces. In the west, to Arianrhod. In the east, toâ
Hubert: Fort Merceus, I presume? There is no better place for such a confrontation after all.
Edelgard: Indeed. And dispatch the Death Knight to guard it. He can buy us some time. In the meantime, I willâ
Hubert: Forgive me, but I must speak bluntly. I do not agree with what you intend to do. Though slight, there is a chance that once done, it cannot be undone.
Edelgard: Even I cannot choose the direction my path leads me. There is no other way. And so, I must walk on.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
After defeating the Kingdom army and King Dimitri on the Tailtean Plains, Imperial forces set their sights on Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital. The final battle against Rhea draws near.

@Dialogue 
Lord Arundel: So, we have finally arrived. It has been a very, very long road.
Edelgard: Why are you here, Uncle? We haven't prevailed just yet.
Lord Arundel: Even better. I decided I wanted to see the end with my own eyes. The very moment that humans will finally be free from the control of that false beast of a goddess..
Edelgard: Understood. Behold to your heart's content, just don't get in our way.
Lord Arundel: Of course. I could not stand to be dragged into the fighting. When this fight is over, a world completely controlled by the Empire will be upon us.
Edelgard: Not completely... I will only do what I must. But until our reign becomes stable... Uncle... No, all of you. I believe that your power and knowledge may be essential during that time of transition.
Lord Arundel: Perhaps so. We also will do what we must. For that short while, we will lend your our strength.
Edelgard: Yes... We're counting on you. For now.

Edelgard: Professor, may I speak with you?
Byleth: What's on your mind?
Edelgard: I know the timing is less than ideal, but there's something I need to tell you. I imagine you've already sensed it, but even still... I must tell you the truth...of the power you wield and of what you are.
Byleth: I have sensed it too.
Edelgard: I expected as much.
Byleth: What are you talking about?
Edelgard: Have you still yet to realize it? If so, then it's absolutely vital that I tell you.
Edelgard: You, like Rhea, share a bloodline with the so-called goddess. Your mother likely had some connection to the goddess, whose power has always been sleeping within you. Five years ago when your power awakened, I was afraid you would choose to join with Rhea.
Byleth: You thought I would join her?
Edelgard: I did.
Byleth: Five years ago...
Edelgard: Yes. In the Sealed Forest, when you returned from the eternal darkness...
Edelgard: As you know, my goal is to free our world from the control of Rhea and the other children of the goddess. I seek to obliterate her, as well as those around her who use the church's power to control FÃ³dlan. I swore to free the people from Rhea by striking her down, whether or not it meant making an enemy of you. And yet...you came to my aid and chose to walk with me on the path against Rhea. I was overjoyed of course, but I was also confused. I thought that perhaps it wasn't the path you were meant to take. But I chose to trust in you, to rely on you and your strength. And now, here we are.
Byleth: I understand...
Edelgard: Thank you for listening, my teacher. I'm glad I finally had the chance to talk to you about it.
Byleth: Please explain it once more.
Edelgard: Of course... 
Edelgard: After Rhea is gone from this world, I don't know what will become of you. But whatever happens, I hope you know that you're very special to me. I hope that I hold a special place in your heart as well. But regardless... 
Edelgard: You are the one person in this world who can share the heavy burden I must carry. Someone without equal who I can always speak my mind to... 
Edelgard: It's time. Let's go, Professor.

@Opening 
The Imperial army arrives in Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital, only to be confronted by Rhea--who has transformed into the Immaculate One. The Black Eagle Strike Force steels itself for an epic final battle, hoping to soon return FÃ³dlan to its people.

@Intro 
Edelgard: Rhea! Members of the Church of Seiros! Surely there's no reason to continue this fight. What could possibly be gained by shutting yourselves inside the capital of a kingdom without a king? I will give you this one chance...and no other. Throw down your weapons and surrender! Unlike you, I have no desire to unleash wicked atrocities upon this world!
Hubert: Their silence speaks volumes. Shall we commence our attack?
Edelgard: I'll wait just a moment longer. There are still many residents within the city. Unlike my attack at Garreg Mach five years ago, the church will not allow the inhabitants to evacuate. What the hell are they planning...

Catherine: Lady Rhea...Or rather, Lady Seiros. The Imperial army is calling for our surrender. Is it wise to ignore them? Perhaps we could leave FÃ³dlan and devise another plan...
Seiros: We shall not surrender. We must not lose! Even if it must split the heavens, we shall not yield to the wicked ones!
Catherine: Understood... I will do as you command. You have my fealty no matter what, until my last moment of life.
Cyril: I'll stay by your side too...forever.
Seiros: Now, Catherine. Set fire to the city. The Imperial army will burn in the flames of eternal torment!
Catherine: What?! No, you can't do that!
Seiros: Catherine. Now.
Catherine: As...as you wish. But is there truly no other way?
Seiros: I have no patience for foolish questions. I shall sacrifice as many lives as it takes! That apostate who insists on taking everything from me...will by crushed by my own hands!

The Immaculate One: GRAAAARGH!

Edelgard: That ghastly voice...
Imperial Soldier: Your Majesty! There's smoke coming from every corner of the capital! It seems they've set fire to the city!
Edelgard: What?! Damn it, Rhea. There really is no depth you wouldn't sink into. Everyone, we must commence our attack at once. Are you ready?
Hubert: Preparations are complete. Just say the word.
Edelgard: Then we attack. We'll head straight for the castle and strike down their leader--Rhea, that vile creature called the Immaculate One! This is the end of our long war. After this victory, FÃ³dlan will finally be united and truly free! The capital we're about to invade is engulfed in flames. Do not rush to your deaths. Survive. Prevail. Do that and we'll witness the birth of a new world. I want to see it with all of you at my side. Understood?
Hubert: Of course. I will not fall and leave you without your protector. That you may live to see your dream to fruition... For that, I shall survive and prevail!
Petra: I am carrying the future of Brigid. I will not be dying here! I will be winning. For myself and everyone, I will be surviving!
Caspar: We've been cutting our own path this whole way. There's no stopping until we reach the end! I can't die, or all my great work so far will have been wasted!
Dorothea: Don't worry about me, Edie. I won't fall before I've found my happily ever after. Maybe when this war is over I can finally snag a good catch and settle down!
Linhardt: Somehow we're already here... I wonder if the peace we secure will allow me to research as much as I'd like. If so, let's end this quickly!
Bernadetta: Edelgard! Professor! I'll do my best for both of you! If I die here, it would be with shame and regret... Oh, I can't let that happen!
Ferdinand: Once the world is united, I will lend my strength to both Edelgard and the Professor. To that end, I will lead us all safely to victory! My pride and duty as a noble demand no less! As do my own principles!
Byleth: Let's win this, together!
Edelgard: Imperial army! Black Eagle Strike Force! Move out!

@Battle 
Edelgard: At last, we made it to Fhirdiad, but...it's in a pitiful state.
Caspar: It's so awful to see the Kingdom capital go up in flames, but at least we made it this far!
Hubert: We finally stand before the palace. Though these flames will our friends and foes alike.
Edelgard: Those who stand in our way will perish with the flames. Immaculate One...your reign ends, here and now!
Catherine: With fire raging all over the city, our enemies won't be able to advance in large numbers. Instead, they may try to defeat us with small squads of elite warriors.
The Immaculate One: Indeed, I suspect as much. And at their head is the one who stole my mother from me and likely that mutinous whelp, Edelgard.

Bernadetta: The whole city's burning! oh, this isn't good! I'm flammable, you know!
Petra: If possible, we must be avoiding the flame and be careful of strong enemies.
Hubert: If we want to minimize our losses, we will need to be flexible in our approach.

The Immaculate One: Open your hearts and accept your fate... The immaculate roar saves only the righteous! GRWOAAAAAARRRR!
Linhardt: What? Her howl as unadulterated magic. I didn't know such a display of power was possible.
Ferdinand: That roar seems to have affected the dolls' movements.
Dorothea: Whenever the Immaculate One howls, those dolls become stronger.
Edelgard: Such power resides in the Immaculate One's roar... We must destroy those golems, and quickly!

@Boss 
Gilbert: I was trusted to protect the future of this nation. The royal bloodline itself! I cannot yield! I will fulfill my duty even if I must forfeit my life!

%Byleth,Gilbert
Gilbert: I can only lament that you chose to side with the Empire. I am a royal knight, and I will destroy all of His Majesty's foes!

%Annette,Gilbert
Gilbert: Annette...I knew this day would come.
Annette: Yes... And so did I, Father. Be warned that I will push you aside, even if I must use force to do it.
Gilbert: I understand. Goddess...this is surely a chastisement from you.

@Boss
Gilbert: Majesty... I beg...forgiveness... My promise to you... I...could not...
Annette: Don't worry, Father... I will protect the capital and the whole Kingdom!

Ashe: Our pride, our people, our king. You've torn them all apart. Haven't you had enough?! What else is there for you to take?!

%Byleth,Ashe
Ashe: Don't look at me that way. You'll throw off my aim!

@Boss
Ashe: I tried...to do the right thing, Lonato...

Annette: I won't let you take Fhirdiad! I'll defend this place with my very life!

%Byleth,Annette
Annette: Why, Professor? Why must we fight like this? Surely there was another path you could have taken that wouldn't have led to this...

@Boss
Annette: Urgh, it hurts... Help me, Father...
Gilbert: Annette! I will avenge you, my daughter. 

Catherine: I will pour everything into this blade--my body, my soul. Thunderbrand rumbles, urging me on. I am the goddess's servant. You will taste my blade!

%Byleth,Catherine
Catherine: I wish you'd never shown your face at Garreg Mach. I always knew you were trouble, yet I did nothing. Time for me to correct that mistake. Prepare to meet your end!

%Shamir,Catherine
Shamir: Hello, Catherine. I always knew this day would come.
Catherine: What a coincidence, so did I. It seems that we now have no choice. We have nothing in common. Not our backgrounds, not our beliefs.
Shamir: Not the way we lived...or the way we die.

@Boss
Catherine: Lady Rhea... My service ends here. It's been an honor.

Cyril: Get away from Lady Rhea!

%Byleth,Cyril
Cyril: You made Lady Rhea hurt! I'll never forgive you!

@Boss
Cyril: Lady Rhea, thank you...for everything...

The Immaculate One: I see the years have not cured humanity of its folly... You still wish to hurt and betray my mother and myself!

%Byleth,The Immaculate One
The Immaculate One: Give her back... Give back my mother! Gaaaaaah!

%Edelgard,The Immaculate One
Edelgard: So it's true. You don't value human life at all. Isn't that right, Immaculate One?
The Immaculate One: Nonsense! Fools who do not accept their own sins are undeserving of salvation! You humans are the ones who betrayed! You betrayed me, and you betrayed my mother!
Edelgard: I did not betray you or her. I never believed in you from the beginning.

@Cutscene 
The Immaculate One: Give it back!
Edelgard: When humanity stands strong and people reach out for each other...there's no need for gods. Rhea. Your reign of tyranny is over.

Edelgard: The time has come.

Edelgard: I'm ending this once and for all!

Edelgard: Is it...is it over?

@Narration 
A rising flame was alight as the flow of time carved a new history for FÃ³dlan. With the fall of Fhirdiad, the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus and the Church of Seiros both vanished into the people's memories. FÃ³dlan was finally one unified nation, under the rule of Emperor Edelgard and the Adrestian Empire. Embracing her newfound power, Edelgard could at last set about destroying FÃ³dlan's entrenched system of nobility and rebuild a world free from the tyranny of Crests and status. Yet beneath the surface, an unseen and silent struggle began to take shape. From her seat of power, Edelgard could at last wage war on those who slither in the dark.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
After a narrow victory over the Knights of Seiros at Garreg Mach, the Black Eagle Strike Force hopes to secure a route to Fhirdiad, the Kingdom capital.

@Dialogue 
Edelgard: The time has come to invade the Kingdom capital. Or so I declared. In truth, we'll be advancing to a different location. Only you and the rest of the Black Eagle Strike Force can know. Please bear that in mind.
Byleth: Of course.
Hubert: Seems you've already anticipated our intentions, Professor. Well done. Before Fhirdiad, we must take Arianrhod, which lies near the border between the Empire and the Kingdom. As a city on the boundary of the two territories, it must be taken at once.
Byleth: What's the plan?
Hubert: There is another location we must take before moving on to Fhirdiad. South of the capital, there is a fortress city on the border of the Empire and the Kingdom. It is called Arianrhod, and we must take control of it at once.
Edelgard: There are many mages within Arianrhod. We will also face Cornelia, a general of the Kingdom. We must also contend with Rodrigue, the head of House Fraldarius, as well as his troops. Once we defeat them, Arianrhod will be ours.
Hubert: I hear Cornelia has a suspicious magic weapon at her disposal. We must attack before the enemy can respond with defensive measures. That is why we are preparing an assault before even our allies are aware. Even within our ranks, there is no way to know with certainty that there is not a rat among us who would leak such information.
Edelgard: When Arianrhod falls, we'll focus on striking Fhirdiad from both the south and the east. The deeper we carve our way into Kingdom and church territory, the more favorable our position. As ever, I'm counting on you, my teacher.

@Conversation 
Edelgard: Professor? Halt! Don't come in here!
Byleth: Hasn't this happened before?
Edelgard: Ugh, I thought I told you to forget about that. There's something I don't want you to see.
Byleth: Is it a portrait?
Edelgard: So...you know about it. Yes, it's a portrait. Of you. I painted it myself. It's, uh...quite disgraceful. I did a terrible job with it, and it looks nothing like you.
Byleth: Thank you for that, Edelgard.
Edelgard: I'm happy that you appreciate my efforts, but...please don't touch that door.




Hubert: This was a trying month, but we did manage to hold Garreg Machâif only just. The power of Seteth and Flayn was certainly a sight to behold. The archbishop's supporters were strong. But with this victory, we have all but cornered the Church of Seiros and its knights. The goddess above shall give away to the darkness that has long dwelled below...

Hubert: This was a trying month, but we did manage to hold Garreg Machâif only just. Honestly, I did not expect such strident supporters of the archbishop as Seteth and Flayn to flee. But with this victory, we have all but cornered the Church of Seiros and its knights. The goddess above shall give away to the darkness that has long dwelled below...



Ferdinand: Dimitri, the King of Faerghus. He despises Edelgard and everything she stands for. I am of the opinion that a man seized by such strong feelings is not fit to be king. It is a sad situation, really.
Byleth: Kings are people too.
Ferdinand: If he cannot suppress his emotions to make reasoned decisions, he should abdicate.
Byleth: Kings can't be emotional? 
Ferdinand: No, they cannot. Kingly judgement has to be wholly separate from the emotions of the individual.
Ferdinand: At any rate, I find it hard to believe that Dimitri could defeat Edelgard.



Linhardt: There are stories of Heroes' Relics a thousand years ago of which we have no real evidence today. So many, in fact, that I'm led to wonder if those Relics are nothing more than legends... Especially since we know of Relics like those passed down in the families of the 10 FÃ³dlan Elites.



Caspar: All right! Off to the Kingdom's capital we go! What's the matter? Should I not be excited? I can't help it. Everyone's gotta have something to look forward to!




Bernadetta: I've got a dream, you know. Not that I think it'll come true, but it's nice to hope. I'd like to get out of FÃ³dlan and travel across the sea. Maybe to Dagda. Maybe even past that. I want to see all the wild jungles out there, the huge flowers, and--oh--the carnivorous plants! I know it's not realistic, and I know it's probably impossible, but that's what I'd like.

Bernadetta: I've got a dream, you know. I don't know if it'll come true, but it's nice to hope. Remember when I went to Brigid, with Petra? I drew a picture of some of the flowers I saw there. Next time, I wanna go even farther. Maybe Dagda. Maybe even past that. I wanna fill a whole book with the drawings of the biggest plants I see! And the carnivorous ones especially! Oh, I hope I get the chance...



Dorothea: I heard that Randolph died in battle guarding Garreg Mach. We knew each other for, wow, more than five years... My chest feels tight. Think about it. There's no end in sight to the fighting. I might be next. Any of us could be.
Byleth: We'll make it through together. Relationship with Dorothea goes up)
Dorothea: Together, eh? That sounds like one of Sylvain's old pick-up lines! But yes, let's get through this war. Together.
Byleth: I don't see an end to it either.
Dorothea: When the days are filled with fighting, or preparing to fight, it really does feel like this could last forever.



Petra: I have excitement in my heart for secret tactics! I enjoy attacks that are surprising.
Byleth: Why's that?
Byleth: Because it's like hunting? 
Petra: Yes. Hunting is like doing surprise attacks on prey.
Petra: Surprise attacks are safe with friends. Fewer injuries. That is a wonderful thing. I have no liking for the thought of losing someone.



Felix: Since I allied with you and the emperor, my resolve has never wavered. I abandoned my country. I am prepared to kill my father, and kill a man I once called my friend. Resolute as I am, my sword feels...heavy.



Ashe: In Faerghus, there's an amazing knight of House Rowe they call the Gray Lion. I heard about him from Lonato, who was an acquaintance of his. Apparently he's getting old, but with each year that passes, he only hones his skills even more.



Sylvain: Some people are so in awe of King Dimitri, they call him the Tempest King. After he wins, there won't be anything left. He'll be a storm, leaving nothing behind. He hates the Empire so much he's willing to do anything to bring it down.
Byleth: He hates the Empire?
Sylvain: Yeah, because of the role the Empire played in the Tragedy of Duscur. You know, even back at the Officers Academy, he never had much to do with anyone from the Empire.
Byleth: He wasn't like that before? 
Sylvain: No. Then again, maybe we just didn't actually know him at all.
Sylvain: We'll be fighting Dimitri and his troops soon. We all oughta train a little harder if we want to stay alive.



Mercedes: Well, that was certainly frightening.
Byleth: What was?
Byleth: The church? 
Mercedes: You're very perceptive, Professor.
Mercedes: Having to fight against the Church of Seiros was unnerving. To push back against something I've hinged so much of my life upon... I was terrified. But now we must fight Lady Rhea, and I won't back down!



Annette: I used to live in the Kingdom capital with my parents. I know we've got no choice but to fight the Kingdom, but I really don't want Fhirdiad to become a battlefield... Lots of my old friends still live in the city, and many people there were kind to me. If fighting breaks out there, all of those people might get caught up in it...



Ingrid: I never thought this day would come--that I'd fight my homeland. My betrothed was a knight who served the king. He died bravely to protect the future of our country. Now I'm betraying the place he fought to protect. I'm betraying him. But I must do this. Professor. I believe in the path you have chosen for us.



Lorenz: It seems we will soon set foot in Fhirdiad. I used to live there, you know. Though that was before my time in the Officers Academy.
Byleth: Were you a hostage?
Lorenz: No, of course not. There is a school of magic there, which I was enrolled in for a time.
Byleth: Were you an exchange student? 
Lorenz: That's right. I was enrolled at the school of magic there for a time.
Lorenz: Trouble within the Kingdom forced me to return to Alliance lands. There was much I had yet to learn.



Raphael: Hyah! Next up is the Kingdom's capital! We're coming for you! What's wrong? Was that too much? Maybe it was too dramatic...or I didn't yell it loud enough!



Ignatz: Soon we'll assault Fhirdiad, the Kingdom's capital! This'll be one for the history books. Our enemy won't hold anything back. I'm quivering with excitement at the very thought of it!
Byleth: Bravo. You put on a good show. 
Ignatz: Heh, I appreciate the compliment! I worried I was laying it on too thick...
Byleth: Your performance is a bit stilted.
Ignatz: Is it? I thought I sounded quite sincere.
Ignatz: In any case, let's do our best! We're coming for you, Fhirdiad! And so on, heh.



Lysithea: I've been informed of the surprise attack. That information could be devastating, were the enemy to find out. It moves me to know I've been trusted with it. Edelgard and those within the army... They really do trust me. Initially, I had my own motives for joining the Black Eagle Strike Force. But now, all I want is to support Edelgard.



Marianne: Even though we're denying the doctrine and fighting the knights, I keep praying to the goddess... When I think about those who have fallen in battle... I...I have no choice but to pray. The goddess of the church may be a fallacy, but I'm sure she still exists in some form. I'm weak. I would be nothing without her.



Leonie: Don't you think this plan to use the entire army for a surprise attack is a bit--I don't know--cowardly? Sorry, the word just kind of slipped out. Maybe don't tell Edelgard or Hubert I said that. No matter the target or strategy, I'll do my job.



Alois: It's hard to feel cheery when you've just gone to battle against old friends. Mraaaugh! No! I will not let myself be gloomy!
Byleth: Go easy on yourself.
Alois: You're trying to take care of me, but it's supposed to be the other way around! Forgive me, Jeralt!
Byleth: How about you go fishing? 
Alois: Fishing, huh? That may brighten my mood a bit, now that you mention it.
Alois: I'm sure it must be even harder for you, to fight against your students. When times are tough, just remember, you can always rely on your old pal Alois!



Shamir: Last month's fight with the Knights of Seiros was a disaster.
Byleth: Are you all right?
Shamir: Are you asking me if I'm OK with killing my former colleagues?
Byleth: You seem fine. 
Shamir: I am. I never believed in Seiros. And my old colleagues are now just enemies.
Shamir: Sometimes it's easier to get by without any personal attachment or religious beliefs.



Hanneman: There's a school of sorcery in Fhirdiad, which is staffed by the top minds of magical research. The study of Crests and sorcery should not be separate. I've often thought I should pay them a visit someday. I never imagined I might end up invading the place with an army though. Not how I imagined it at all.



Manuela: How have we come to this? Fighting the archbishop and her knights... I'd never imagined... I hate this. So much. Professor, I tried. I gave treatment to everyone I could, but...but lives were still lost. The infirmary is as much a morgue right now as it is a place of care and healing...



Jeritza: The Knights of Seiros... They certainly know how to inflict pain. However. The demon within me will be satiated only by fighting you.



Anna: There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals.



Fleche: My brother fought proudly to the end and died an honorable death. He said something to me before the battle. That he was entrusting his dream to me... I'm gonna see this battle through to the end. I'm gonna fight for my brother!



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Between Garreg Mach and Fhirdiad stretch the plains of Tailtean. That's the sight of the ancient battle where Nemesis, the King of Liberation, fought the prophet Seiros. If our forces end up fighting our enemies there... It'll be a clash passed down through the ages!

@Intro 
Rodrigue: Cornelia! I have a report from our scouts. The Imperial army that departed from Garreg Mach en route to the capital now appears to be marching here.
Cornelia: What did you just say?!
Rodrigue: The speed of the army's movement quickens... They will be here to invade within days. I just sent some of my troops to support the capital. It is likely to be a fierce fight...
Cornelia: How could this be? I have not heard a thing about... Ah... I understand now. I am the target.
Rodrigue: You? Are you sure they do not mean to take Arianrhod for strategic reasons?
Cornelia: It would appear so from the outside. However, the circumstances are not that simple. And will you calm yourself? It will not be a fierce fight whatsoever. The sweet children I have prepared will protect Arianrhod well...
Rodrigue: Cornelia...

Hubert: Arianhrod is a fortress city that was built about 400 years ago. Originally a base on the front lines of the battle against the Kingdom, it was built using Imperial money and technology.
Edelgard: However, the head of House Rowe secretly planned to betray the Empire. As the fortress neared completion, it was rebuilt as a base to defend against the Empire. When the fortress was completed, House Rowe declared its vassalage to the Kingdom.
Hubert: Since then, Arianrhod has never fallen. Not once. The beautiful white walls that protect it against its enemies have earned it the nickname the Silver Maiden. In the end, that is all it is to the Empire... the Silver Maiden stands as a bitter memory.
Petra: We will now be destroying that memory. The past is the past. Now is now.
Caspar: A fortress that has never fallen?! Ooh, I can't wait to make it fall!
Ferdinand: How savage of you. And yet, I must say I agree with the sentiment. Let us take the sturdy Arianrhod and continue our march against the Kingdom!
Bernadetta: An invincible fortress? Sounds perfect!
Linhardt: Unfortunately, it will soon no longer be invincible. The Silver Maiden's iron skin is about to be damaged. It's sad, really.
Petra: Is it silver or iron? Use your language with clarity, please.
Dorothea: Really, Lin. There must be a better way to say that. Since we are attacking a heavily guarded place, we must take extra care to prevent allies from getting injured.
Edelgard: Thank you, everyone. I'm counting on all of you. Now, let's resume our advance.
Hubert: This battle is for the future of FÃ³dlan...

@Opening 
In order to secure a successful invasion of Fhirdiad, Edelgard launches a raid on the Fortress City of Arianrhod, which occupies a key position on the border. At Arianrhod, a mage serving House Blaiddyd named Cornelia and the head of House Fraldarius, Rodrigue, strengthen their defenses.

With razor-sharp focus on the unification of FÃ³dlan, Edelgard feigns a premature assault on Fhirdiad while the Black Eagle Strike Force instead descends on the southern stronghold of Arianrhod.

@Battle 
Cornelia: How could they deceive me and close in on Arianrhod?! But it's not like I'm just going to just stand by and watch... I will slaughter them all.
Edelgard: So this is the Silver Maiden... Seeing it with my own eyes, I finally understand its strength. Especially the fact that its strength is distributed across its frontal defenses. We'll attack the front and keep our enemy occupied while the others by the east gate.

Cornelia: Titanus, my lovely dolls... Seek out the enemy and destroy them! And if the chance presents itself, I wouldn't mind being rid of those unsightly Kingdom forces too!
Hubert: Are those Cornelia's magical weapons? Impressive.

Felix: Want to die? Step forward. I'll take you all. 
Ingrid: We all chose our paths and I've chosen mine. I fight for my lord, to the death! 

Edelgard: Traps awaiting us inside the castle... What a nuisance. But with such large-scale traps, there must be some sort of mechanism to control them.


Hubert: The traps are still functional. There must be more of these devices.

Edelgard: The traps are disabled.

@Boss 
Ingrid: I will protect Arianrhod to the bitter end. This I have promised to my ancestors, to His Majesty, and to myself!

%Byleth,Ingrid
Ingrid: You have chosen to assist the Empire, even while knowing of their deeds. I am truly disappointed in you, Professor. Prepare yourself, heel of the Empire! A wretch like you will never be qualified to rule over FÃ³dlan!

%Felix,Ingrid
Ingrid: Felix, why?
Felix: Urrgh...
Ingrid: You've betrayed His Majesty, Glenn, and Lord Rodrigue. You've betrayed just about everyone!
Felix: You couldn't possibly understand. If you're going to stand in my way, I'll have to kill you.

%Sylvain,Ingrid
Ingrid: Sylvain. This isn't funny. What are you doing?
Sylvain: I'm sorry, Ingrid. I believe in what the professor is trying to do more than I do in my own country.
Ingrid: Perhaps my blade will cut away the scales from your eyes!

@Boss
Ingrid: Maybe...I've become like him...

Felix: There you are, standing before me, ready for death. I will administer the finishing blow.

%Byleth,Felix
Felix: Part of me has been waiting for this since I met you. No need for chitchat. Come at me!

%Sylvain,Felix
Sylvain: Hey, Felix? Remember when we were kids and we made a promise about dying together?
Felix: I remember.
Sylvain: Well, seems we're about to kill each other.
Felix: Sorry, Sylvain. You'll die first.

%Ingrid,Felix
Felix: All that talk about chivalry and loyalty, only to turn against your homeland.
Ingrid: Maybe I'm not a knight after all. Not in the traditional sense, anyway. I've betrayed lord and family alike. And I've done so because I believe in the professor. I fight for that which I believe in!
Felix: So, you won't step aside. Then I'll have to kill you.

@Boss
Felix: I failed...
Rodrigue: Felix, I'm so sorry... I swear to avenge you! 

Rodrigue: I am the king's shield, devoted to protecting the Kingdom, as well as the king's lance, who kills his foes! In the name of House Fraldarius...I will defeat you all!

%Felix,Rodrigue
Rodrigue: So, my foolish son... You took it upon yourself to leave your family behind.
Felix: I'm not coming back. I won't serve the boar.
Rodrigue: It's a father's duty to settle his child's failures. Felix... You must die here and now!

@Boss
Rodrigue: So this is it... Your Majesty... Please bring us victory!
Felix: Father... I will fight in your stead. 

Gwendal: Does a whelp like you really expect to kill me? I am Gwendal, the Gray Lion, a knight by the hand of Count Rowe! Do your worst!

Gwendal: So this is where I meet my end...

Cornelia: Oh my, what a charming guest. Let me take care of you...

Cornelia: Gah! So this is as far as I could get...

@Byleth,Cornelia
Cornelia: Ah, such a shame... I always thought we'd end up being good friends. But here you are as my enemy... The only thing left to do is to kill you, right?

@End 
Cornelia: Ah... All is in accordance with this carefully crafted script of ours... What a masterpiece! What a delightful dance... 

Edelgard: Victory is ours! Arianrhod has fallen! Another army will take control of Arianrhod. As for us, we will take all of the military force we can muster and advance to the Kingdom capital of Fhirdiad. It won't be long before all of FÃ³dlan is unified. Everyone, this is our last push. Our goal is within reach!

@End 
Edelgard: What turn of events has brought you so suddenly to Garreg Mach, Uncle?
Lord Arundel: Well, my business in the old Alliance territory had roughly finished. I wanted to see the face of my niece, who so bravely took Arianrhod. I have heard that it was done with truly magnificent tact. And that you even deceived some of your allies.
Edelgard: I'm happy to have earned your praise. However, to say that I deceived my allies is a bit misleading. I despise leaks of information, and there may have been a church rat hiding amongst our ranks.
Lord Arundel: Ah, I see. However, there are some unfortunate consequences. Cornelia surely planned to betray them, but...she has been struck down. Truly wasteful meddling. Unless... Was it your intention to kill her?
Byleth: It was. 
Edelgard: Professor, don't joke about that. The only ones we came to kill were our enemies.
Byleth: It was not.
Byleth: I didn't care either way.
Edelgard: Indeed. We came only to kill our enemies.
Edelgard: She used a terrible magic weapon... Dolls that she could move and fight with. Did you know about them?
Lord Arundel: Well now... If that were the case, would it not have been better to keep her as an ally? If you are only capable of such imprudence, this dark cloud might hang over the Empire's future as well.
Edelgard: Thank you for your concern. However, I will sweep aside any darkness that comes our way.
Lord Arundel: I will be praying. Praying that the Empire will not become another Arianrhod.
Edelgard: Another Arianrhod? Just what do you mean...
Lord Arundel: Hmph. I must take my leave now. Farewell.

Hubert: Lady Edelgard, there you are. We just received some truly shocking news. It is said that pillars of light have rained from the heavens and disintegrated Arianrhod.
Edelgard: Disintegrated?
Byleth: How is that possible...
Hubert: It was likely some type of magic... Perhaps a forbidden art.
Byleth: Was it Lord Arundel...
Hubert: Why would he do that?
Hubert: Was Lord Arundel just here? So that would mean...
Edelgard: Hubert! Give me the full report!
Hubert: Ah, my apologies. I, of all people, should be able to control my discomposure. The pillars of light descended and exploded, resulting in the complete destruction of the main building and the north wall. It is believed that all key people within House Rowe, including its leader, were killed. Of the Imperial officers and men we kept at Arianrhod, about a third are unaccounted for...
Edelgard: It can't be true... So...this is my uncle's trump card. In exchange for striking down Cornelia, he has destroyed Arianrhod!
Hubert: Perhaps we acted too soon in our disposal of Cornelia...
Edelgard: No. If we'll be fighting them soon, there's no disadvantage to weakening their forces. It's also extremely valuable that we forced them to show their hand. Hubert, the investigation you made into the legend of Ailell, the Valley of Torment... This is likely what took place back then as well.
Hubert: Yes... The probability is high.
Byleth: Valley of Torment?
Byleth: The same thing happened in the past? 
Hubert: Yes, it is quite likely.
Hubert: North of Garreg Mach there is a valley where the earth is always aflame. Once, javelins of light fell from the sky there... They pierced the earth and set the forest ablaze, creating a land of torment. We believed it may have been the work of the goddess, but... It was actually an attack by those who slither in the dark. That sums up all that we know.
Edelgard: By giving us that knowledge, those who died at Arianrhod will not have died in vain.
Hubert: Indeed. It would be good to control the flow of this information.
Edelgard: True. We'll conceal this from everyone as best as we can. I trust you, my teacher.

Edelgard: I'm sure everyone has heard about what transpired at Arianrhod. The church has displayed their cowardice by indiscriminately using forbidden practices to kill the residents there. Their victims also include members of House Rowe, the Imperial army, and many, many more.
Hubert: According to our investigation, the forbidden attack that destroyed Arianrhod cannot be used again so quickly. Even so, we cannot delay our efforts. We must put a stop to all of this by the end of next month. The leader of one of the Imperial factions has already initiated an attack on the Fraldarius territory lost by Rodrigue... Soon, all obstacles blocking our path to Fhirdiad will have vanished.
Edelgard: A cornered animal is at its most deadly. We must move quickly. Next, we march through the Tailtean Plains. After that, we destroy Fhirdiad. At that time, complete Imperial control over FÃ³dlan will finally be a reality.
Caspar: Ah, I'm shaking with excitement! Bring on the battle!
Dorothea: I understand that a confrontation is inevitable. Still... I wonder if there's some path we could take that would cause less suffering...
Petra: This is the only path for the goal we are reaching for, and so we must keep walking on it. We are walking down the path to a better tomorrow.
Linhardt: A cornered church... Hmm, well, count me out from any forbidden sorcery that can destroy whole cities. If only there was an easier way to get more information on Crests and Relics...
Ferdinand: You are as negative as usual, Linhardt. We have but one order. To emerge victorious!
Bernadetta: We're going to win this! We really are! After all, if we lose, everything will be terrible forever! Oh, no way! We can't let that happen!
Caspar: There's a lot to worry about, but...I'm sure it will all work out! We'll win no matter what!
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Having crushed the Alliance's army and captured the Great Bridge of Myrddin, the Imperial army prepares to attack Derdriu--the Alliance's base of operations.

@Dialogue 
Edelgard: Professor, what is your opinion of Claude? I can't help but wonder what sort of impression he made on you.
Byleth: He's a schemer.
Edelgard: That is inarguable. And his schemes are still going strong. With them, he's managed to keep the Leicester Alliance from the Empire's grasp.
Byleth: He's a jokester.
Edelgard: That much is obvious. He acts like a fool, but still manages to make the impossible happen. That's as true now as ever. He's managed to protect the Leicester Alliance with his cunning alone.
Byleth: He would be a good king.
Edelgard: Interesting... I've never thought of him like that. However, I know you have a keen eye for potential. After all, as leader of the Leicester Alliance, he has managed to protect his entire territory all this time.
Byleth: How has he done that?
Edelgard: Since the beginning, territories within the Alliance have been split between those who support the Empire and those who oppose it. Claude has been acting as an intermediary between the two, essentially keeping the Alliance pacified. As both sides are of equal strength, he's created a situation in which they've all agreed to avoid fighting each other and causing undue bloodshed. By carrying on as though the Alliance is united, he's minimized the Empire's influence there.

Hubert: Heh. It's quite impressive how well his bold scheme has worked out. However, he is walking on thin ice. One wrong move and the Alliance will shatter.  Speaking of Claude... Your Majesty, we should not delay in our invasion of the Alliance. It would seem that Claude has some fresh scheme up his sleeve, to no one's surprise.
Edelgard: Is that so?
Hubert: Yes. The people of Derdriu have suddenly found it difficult to leave or enter the city. We can safely assume he is preparing for battle, but I am certain his plans extend beyond that as well. Do you not think we should take Derdriu at once?
Edelgard: Derdriu, the Aquatic Capital... A city floating on the ocean certainly poses a challenge. Since it's deep within Riegan territory, we haven't had the opportunity to attack it directly. However, now that we have control of the Great Bridge of Myrddin, our situation has changed drastically. They can no longer expand their supply line into the Empire, and so we can finally attack Riegan territory.
Hubert: House Riegan is not only Claude's house, but also the flagship of those who oppose the Empire within the Alliance. If House Riegan falls, the other Alliance lords will be tripping over themselves to join us. That is why we cannot fail to take Derdriu.
Byleth: Let's go.
Hubert: Confidence is one thing, Professor, but see to it that you do not underestimate Claude.
Byleth: That seems difficult.
Hubert: Fair enough. Claude will certainly be a difficult opponent.
Hubert: The leader of the Alliance has had many things said about him... They say he is unbeatable in a battle of intellect. I hear they call him the Master Tactician.

@Conversation 
Edelgard: I wish we could settle all of this before the fighting begins. Don't you? I wish it dearly. But few others feel that way. They fight in a bloody battle, take countless lives, and then finally come to understand defeat. They refuse to admit when they're beaten, and they keep it up until they've been utterly defeated. Of course, I understand that sacrifice is inevitable... But if they're going to surrender after being defeated anyway, why raise a weapon in the first place?



Hubert: So, we've somehow managed to take the Great Bridge of Myrddin. That means House Gloucester should now be ready to join the fold more formally. We've blown a major hole in Claude's plans to preserve the Alliance. We should press on to Derdriu before he has the opportunity to adjust his strategy.



Ferdinand: I have been wondering something... If I had not been your student, where would I be right now? Who would I be? Do you ever think that sort of thing, Professor?
Byleth: Like what if I had led a different class?
Ferdinand: Ah, so you do think about such questions. You can never find answers though, right? We cannot turn back time, so there is no way to go back and try a different path.
Byleth: Like what if I had turned against the Empire? 
Ferdinand: Ah, so you do think about such questions. You can never find answers though, right? We cannot turn back time, so there is no way to go back and try a different path.
Byleth: No, I don't.
Ferdinand: I see... You are so focused and coolheaded. I wish I could be more like you.



Linhardt: I never do get used to the sight of blood. It always makes me feel as if I might faint. I suppose I've told you that though, yes? I've no idea how you cope with it. I hope this war ends soon. I dislike being lightheaded because other people are bleeding everywhere. It's all a great deal of a bother, but I will do my part of course.



Caspar: Didn't they used to call Claude the Master Tactician? I want a nickname too! Maybe I'll get one if I can defeat him at Derdriu... I'll come up with a plan that'll beat his and earn me a nickname for sure!



Bernadetta: Claude... Claude... Which was he again? Oh! Right. Yeah, of course I remember him. It's just... I can't picture his face. Don't remember what he looks like. I'm not sure if I ever knew. Oh well. He's just another enemy now, isn't he? What, am I not supposed to say that?!



Dorothea: I'm happy when we win battles, and I'm always relieved when our friends make it back safe. On the other hand, it's hard to watch the enemy die. Even worse when it's someone you know. Perhaps it would have been better if I'd just stayed with the opera...
Byleth: I don't think so. 
Dorothea: You're right, Professor. I'll never regret the choices I made.
Byleth: Perhaps... 
Dorothea: No, Professor. I refuse to regret my past decisions.
Dorothea: Now you just have to lead us to victory so everyone else can let go of their regrets too.



Petra: Since the past, I have learned much of the language of FÃ³dlan. But speaking the FÃ³dlan language still gives me difficulty. I can understand, read, and white with nearly perfection now. But understanding and speaking are...fruits of a different color.
Byleth: That's part of your charm. 
Petra: I have gratitude for you, Professor. I hope that I will have fluency one day.
Byleth: Everyone has a weak spot.
Petra: Yes. I will keep practicing more.



Felix: I hear Claude's earned himself a rather colorful nickname. He does whatever it takes to win. I like that. It will be especially satisfying to defeat him. I can't wait to see what his next move is.



Ashe: Food has gotten scarce since the war started. Lately the prices have really been going up. Normally that would mean reducing our own take, but we just can't afford to do that. If we lose this war, we lose everything. Still, the townspeople are the ones who will suffer from this the most. The longer this goes on, the more people will starve.



Sylvain: Derdriu, the Aquatic Capital... I've heard it's a magnificent city, you know. If we're going, I wish it wasn't to wage war. It'd be more fun to visit with a cute girl on my arm.
Byleth: Maybe once the war is over... 
Sylvain:  You're right. That's something to look forward to.
Sylvain:  Yeah? Maybe you and me? That'd be a good reason to survive the war. Heh heh...
Byleth: Forget it.
Sylvain: Aw, come on. Let a guy dream.



Mercedes: Flowers are so resilient, aren't they? Despite the war going on outside the monastery, here they are, blooming beautifully. I hope we get to see more kinds of flowers when the weather warms up...



Annette: Derdriu, huh? I've always wanted to go there. In Faerghus, most of the towns are pretty much glorified fortresses. So to hear about a place called the Aquatic capital...it just sounds so elegant! Let's go for a leisurely visit someday, promise? You know...after the war is over.



Ingrid: Judith of Daphnel. You were a force to be reckoned with. You will not be forgotten. In another life, I might have fought by her side.
Byleth: What's done is done.
Ingrid: As harsh as that is, it's the truth of it. It's over now.
Byleth: I understand the sentiment. 
Ingrid: It's a harsh truth, but it's the truth nonetheless. We can't change the past.



Lorenz: Now that we've seized the Great Bridge of Myrddin, House Gloucester is comfortable aligning itself with the Empire. The path to Riegan lands lies straight before us. Our clash with Claude draws nearer by the moment.
Byleth: Having second thoughts?
Lorenz: Not at all. On the contrary, I look forward to it. My old rival will be a worthy test for me.
Byleth: Will he put up a hard fight? 
Lorenz: I certainly hope so. I would be quite disappointed if my greatest rival were to simply roll over.
Lorenz: I know Claude better than anyone. He is a schemer. No doubt he has some trap for us in mind. Let us be vigilant, Professor.



Raphael: We're gonna go up against Claude next? I haven't seen him in forever. Wonder how he's been... I chose this side because I believe in you, Professor. But it's not like I got anything against Claude.
Byleth: What was he like?
Raphael: Hmm... Well, he loved parties, and he was full of some pretty good jokes!
Byleth: Were you close? 
Raphael: Of course! Claude was the kinda person who would be instantly friends with anyone.
Raphael: I don't mind so much that we gotta fight him, I just hope he doesn't get killed...



Ignatz: I thought I was ready for this, but it's not easy to fight against my old schoolmates... I was in the Golden Deer House, so I have a lot of memories with them.
Byleth: Are you feeling conflicted? 
Ignatz: No, I'm not. I decided to fight alongside you, and I will not waver.
Byleth: It's hard for me too.
Ignatz: Really, it is? I wish that we could resolve this without violence.
Ignatz: Then again, precisely because they're old friends, I wouldn't leave this to someone else. I have to assume responsibility.



Lysithea: Without the support of the pro-Imperialist lords, the Alliance is greatly weakened. Even so, I don't feel great about all this. We're gonna be fighting Claude...
Byleth: We must not let our guard down. 
Lysithea: We can't--you're right. Claude has such unusual strategies for toying with his enemies.
Byleth: We can definitely win.
Lysithea: Even so, we should stay alert. Claude won't be caught off guard. Neither should we.
Lysithea: Even with you here, this battle will be very challenging.



Marianne: The tide of war is clearly favoring us, but Claude refuses to surrender. I wonder why that could be...
Byleth: It's against his principles.
Marianne: Frankly, it seems to me that his ideals are not that far removed from Edelgard's...
Byleth: The way he sees it, we can't both exist. 
Marianne: I think you're probably right...
Marianne: I suppose even the very powerful can be irrational at times...



Leonie: I'm from Alliance lands, but I'm only a commoner. The idea of fighting Alliance nobles isn't exactly losing me any sleep. Fighting old friends though? That's something else. Ugh. I'd better clear my head. Captain Jeralt used to say a mercenary has to be thoughtless. Guess I finally get what he meant.



Alois: Do you ever regret taking the path you did?
Byleth: Yes.
Alois: Hm. I guess doubts and regrets just come with being human.
Byleth: No. 
Alois: Hah, the very model of a leader! I should take a page out of your book.
Byleth: All the time.
Alois: Hm. I guess doubts and regrets just come with being human.
Alois: Whatever path you choose going forward, I'll follow you without question.



Shamir: Claude, eh? He always was sharp among his peers. Never let himself get caught up in conventions. He wasn't typical in FÃ³dlan. Then there's Rhea and King Dimitri... I'd stay on their good sides, for different reasons.
Byleth: You don't have a choice.
Byleth: I have no desire to kill them, but... 
Shamir: Yeah, well... If that's the only way forward, it can't be helped.



Hanneman: Professor, I think you should be made aware of a certain group working with the Imperial army. They are the same lot that invented a technique to turn monsters into war assets. It's quite obvious their trick draws on the power of the Crest Stones, but... There is something more to it than that. Some secret I have yet to decipher. I suppose I need to better understand what kind of people they are. Who are they? What do they want? For her part, Miss Edelgard is cooperating, yet does not hide her hostility towards them. I suspect we should prepare in case the day should come when we must combat these strange people.



Manuela: Remember the Death Knight who stabbed me five years ago? Of course you do. How could you forget? Well, it turns out he's a general in the Imperial army! He leads the western front against the Kingdom. Once I knew he was at Garreg Mach, I stormed right up to him, told him who I was, and what he did... And he offered me an apology. I'm talking about a sincere, heartfelt, solemn apology. What a letdown. What's going on with that guy, anyway? Who is he under that mask?
Manuela: Oh, hello there, Professor. Did you need something from me? It doesn't look like you're wounded or anything. You just looking for...someone to talk to?
Byleth: Yes.
Manuela: I thought so. Well, I'm here for you! Making you feel better is my top priority.
Byleth: No.
Manuela: Come on now, you don't have to be shy. Helping you feel better is important to me.
Manuela: Whether it's physical pain or worries of the heart, you can come to me for anything, Professor.



Jeritza: What is it?
Byleth: I just want to chat a bit.
Jeritza: I have no words for you. I have blades, and if you wish to cross them, I'll be more than happy to. Although you may not be.
Byleth: Nothing.


Randolph: Lately, the Kingdom and the Knights of Seiros haven't made any significant moves. I don't suppose they're going to stand by and watch while we attack Derdriu though. That's why I've doubled our guard and instructed them to be extra vigilant. I will keep Garreg Mach safe! It is my duty and responsibility.



Fleche: Big brother always gets me so fired up... Better keep an eye on him. Oh, sorry! I was just talking to myself. I hear you're heading out to Derdriu. Good luck with the battle!



Ladislava: Five years ago, during the attack on this place, you allowed me to join your side. Since then I've risen through the ranks, and now I'm a general leading my own army. In this invasion of the Alliance, I've been entrusted with maintaining the supply lines and keeping the Goneril territories under control. That's why I won't be accompanying to Derdriu. Please look after Lady Edelgard.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Derdriu is known as the Aquatic capital... It's a beautiful town with streets that seem to float on the water and an impressive harbor. In times of peace, it would be a wonderful place for a holiday... Anyway! Best of luck in the next battle!

@Intro 
Edelgard: It's almost time to depart. Are you ready?
Byleth: Leave it to me.
Edelgard: A promising answer. Whatever happens, never allow your foe to see any weakness.
Byleth: I don't think we can win.
Edelgard: I agree that Claude will prove a difficult foe. Still, do not speak such words right before a battle.
Edelgard: We must pay attention not only to Claude's schemes but to the man himself. He's a master archer who wields the legendary bow Failnaught. He won't fall easily.
Byleth: Failnaught...
Edelgard: It's the Relic of House Riegan. That bow once belonged to one of the 10 Elites. Professor... Do you know the true story behind the legend? The Relics were created by the hands of mankind. Seiros collected them after killing the 10 Elites. Seiros manipulated the people of the world and defeated the all-powerful King Nemesis.
Byleth: I thought he was corrupted by his power?
Edelgard: That's the history the Church of Seiros maintains. However, it was little more than a simple dispute.
Byleth: Why would she do that?
Edelgard: The church maintains the false history that he was corrupted and turned evil. However, it was little more than a simple dispute.
Edelgard: Should the one leading the people of the world be someone with humanity or a creature that can merely masquerade as a human at will? In the end, Seiros was victorious. The Immaculate One and her family then took control of FÃ³dlan. I know this because that knowledge is passed down from emperor to emperor. And that is the because the first emperor is the human who cooperated with Seiros, allowing humanity to be controlled in secret.
Byleth: ...
Edelgard: Perhaps it's fate that you can wield the Sword of the Creator, just like Nemesis, the King of Liberation. And that very fate will lead you to use that sword to stand against those who would distort history.

Claude: It seems they've set out from Garreg Mach... That's sooner than expected. Losing the Great Bridge of Myrddin was a serious blow. So is the fact that Teach is still alive. On top of all that...Judith. I told her to run if things looked grim. Damn it. So many people will die, and by my call.
Nader: And what of it? Would you rather turn tail and run back home?
Claude: Nader... You're really getting on my nerves. Do you have any idea how much of the Alliance adores me and believes in me?
Nader: Well, I suppose it's quite a lot. Does that mean that...
Claude: Yes. The plan is a go. I'm counting on you, Nader. We'll make a good show taking down those who would assault Derdriu.
Nader: People say our kind may not always win, but we never lose. Let's teach them the real meaning of those words.

Claude: Now then... Let's see what you're made of, Teach...

@Opening 
North of the Great Bridge of Myrddin, the Imperial Army passes through the allied territory of House Gloucester and invades the land of House Riegan, which leads the opposition. They move to attack Claude in the capital, Derdriu, where the leader of the Alliance awaits their arrival.

After seizing the Great Bridge of Myrddin, the Black Eagle Strike Force makes its way to Derdriu, the Aquatic Capital, where Claude awaits.

@Battle 
Claude: Here she comes, at long last... I've done all I can to prepare. Let the cards fall where they may. It'll be a true test of strength.
Edelgard: It seems Claude has blockaded the city and occupied the naval port.
Hubert: Heh. If that is the case, he will have no choice but to engage us from there.
Edelgard: Yes. Though putting myself in Claude's place leaves me with an unpleasant feeling... If we take over the port and close the entry to the city, Derdriu will be under our control. Each soldier should bear that in mind as they advance.

Hubert: There are three gates which connect Derdriu to its naval port. Taking the city will be easy once we secure all three.

Claude: Now it's our turn, Almyra's elite! Strike the flanks of the Imperial army!

Claude: Those fangs and claws the Alliance fears so much will now be their salvation!
Nader: Leave it to us, kiddo! My undefeated streak will live on. Another chapter in my heroic saga!
Edelgard: That flag and banner... Is that the Almyran army? Ugh, you really did it, Claude!
Hubert: This is no ruse. That is Nader, an Almyran general.
Edelgard: Take care of them quickly! Especially those Almyran wyverns!

Hubert: The Almyran reinforcements keep coming. We should try to eliminate Nader...

Villager: We don't have the guts to resist anymore! Here...you can have this! Just please don't attack the city!
Edelgard: I never planned to touch the city. Our target is the Alliance and their leader, Claude.

@Boss
Hilda: You didn't forget about me, did you? Maybe you should just let me go.

%Byleth,Hilda
Hilda: Professor! It's been too long. But now we're on opposite sides, huh? What a shame. I'm not going to hold back. I can't let down my dear old Claude.

%Marianne,Hilda
Marianne: I-I'm so sorry, Hilda. I...
Hilda: It's OK, Marianne. These things happen in war.

@Boss
Hilda: It's been fun, Claude... Sorry to go so soon...
Claude: Hilda! Why didn't you retreat?! I counted on you retreating...

Lysithea: Don't expect me to go easy on you. Because I won't.

%Byleth,Lysithea
Lysithea: You are here as well, Professor? That is a shame...

%Edelgard,Lysithea
Edelgard: Lysithea. How unfortunate that a talented woman like you should throw her life away on a pointless battle.
Lysithea: Ha, do not underestimate me. The fight is far from over, Edelgard!

@Boss
Lysithea: That's the last of my energy. If you're gonna kill me, make it quick. Fair warning though, I'll likely come back to haunt you. It's not like I've had an easy time of it, after all...
^start
Lysithea: You...want me to join you? The Alliance is over no matter what. The only thing left is to place faith in you and Edelgard. There's still so much I have to accomplish. Thank you for the second chance, Professor.

Lysithea: Father, Mother... I'm sorry I didn't listen to you...
^end

@Boss
Nader: It's been 30-odd years since I set foot on a field of battle. Here's a taste of my undefeated strength!

%Edelgard,Nader
Nader: The emperor continues fighting at the front line. Is the Empire short on troops?
Edelgard: Unfortunately, I can't deny it. But then, I've heard the Almyran king does the very same. You have traveled far. I do hope it's for a king who would not only lead his army but fight at their side.
Nader: TouchÃ©... Yes, he is that sort of king!

@Boss
Nader: Sorry, kiddo. It seems we'll have to withdraw...
Claude: You've done enough, Nader. Just stay alive. We'll meet again one day!
Edelgard: We have forced the Almyran forces to flee. I doubt they're expecting more reinforcements.

Claude: Heh... So sad that our reunion should take place on the battlefield.

%Byleth,Claude
Claude: Teach... You should have chosen me instead of Edelgard. No point in whining about it now, I suppose. Sorry, but I'll be taking the win today.

%Edelgard,Claude
Claude: We haven't seen each other since Garreg Mach. You've grown lovelier than ever, Edelgard.
Edelgard: You're not so unfortunate yourself. And as usual, you're here at a most inopportune moment.
Claude: Well, I'm sure we have much more to talk about... But how about we settle things first?
Edelgard: No objections here. Prepare yourself, Claude.

%Jeritza,Claude
Claude: Hey, how long's it been? Five years? Who'd have thought you'd end up as an Imperial general...

@Boss
Claude: Enough! You've bested me. If I die here, the Alliance becomes part of the Empire.
Edelgard: Do you yield, then? You've never known when to give up.
Claude: Well, I can't just surrender so easily. I'm responsible for the others. If you're as smart as you seem, I bet you've figured out why I was able to summon Almyran reinforcements. Wouldn't it be better to let me go and have me in your debt?
^start
Claude: Thank you, Professor. And you, Edelgard. I'm truly grateful for your courageous decision. I will return your kindness one day... I promise. 

Claude: I see. Right until the very end, I've read this whole thing terribly wrong... All my hopes have fallen to ash... It's all up to you now, Edelgard... I really hope you do make the world...better... 
^end
Edelgard: Everybody! Raise your voices in a victory cheer! Derdriu is ours!

@End 
^start
Claude: Hey, Teach.
Edelgard: Claude?!
Claude: Settle down, will you? You're the victor, after all. I could have escaped, but I decided to say hi to Teach. Nothing to worry about. Derdriu has fallen and the Alliance has collapsed. There's nothing I could do to turn things around at this point.
Edelgard: You want me to drop my guard around someone who evaded detection by my soldiers? Impossible. Did you really risk coming here just to say hello?
Claude: I did. But mostly, I wanted to say good-bye. I'm leaving FÃ³dlan.
Byleth: Why are you leaving?
Byleth: Lend us your strength.
Claude: Lend you my... I knew I liked you, Teach!
Claude: I daresay FÃ³dlan would be a lot more peaceful without me around. Right, Your Majesty?
Edelgard: It's as you say. So long as you remain here, the faction of the Alliance that is against the Empire will continue to support you.
Claude: Too true. It's best if I leave this place altogether. I'll just have to find some other way to pay back my debt to you. All I ask is that you go easy on the Alliance. After all, no one there would dare defy you. And please, treat my former classmates well. I've asked them to cooperate with you if I lost.
Edelgard: Wait... Did your scheming include a plan for if the Alliance lost?
Claude: Heh, you think too highly of me. It just seems that way now. Outside of Derdriu, most of the Alliance is unscathed and ready to join your superior strength. In all honesty, I was hoping to become a supreme ruler and lead FÃ³dlan to peace myself. But...that won't be happening now.
Edelgard: Claude...
Claude: Good luck to you, Edelgard.
Edelgard: We crushed him in battle and yet... He really is difficult to understand.

Edelgard: Derdriu is ours. The Alliance has collapsed, and their leader has fallen.
Byleth: Did we really have to kill him?
Edelgard: If Claude had lived, the faction of the Alliance that is against the Empire would have never stopped fighting us. To keep the bloodshed to a minimum, he had to be taken out of the equation. However, now that it's over, I can't help but wonder if he was in complete control of that entire situation. What will become of the Alliance without him... He must have taken that into account. Without the rule of House Riegan, and with most of the territory left unscathed, the Alliance will undoubtedly ally itself with the Empire. The citizen's lives will be saved from ruin, and no more blood will be shed. Perhaps that's what he wanted from the start...
Byleth: That sounds like Claude.
Edelgard: Of course, if his plan here in Derdriu had worked and I had lost my life...the opposite would have come to pass. The Empire would have rushed to the Alliance without further conflict. No matter how the battle unfolded, Claude secured the shortest, most peaceful possible outcome.
^end
Hubert: Lady Edelgard, Derdriu is now completely under our control. As planned, the Alliance's affairs will now be overseen by Count Bergliez.
Caspar: My father is coming here? First west, than east... You sure keep him busy.
Hubert: Should the others return to the monastery and prepare to face the Kingdom?
Edelgard: Yes. Thank you, Hubert. Thanks to all of your efforts, our battle with the Alliance has reached its conclusion. However, we still can't afford to be careless. We must now join the battle against the Kingdom. With the strength of the church on their side, they will prove to be a formidable enemy. More than ever, your support is invaluable. We'll need it in the days to come. But for now, let's enjoy our triumphant return!
Caspar: Let's get to it!
Dorothea: I'm so happy that the end of the fighting is near. Too bad there's still more violence to come...
Petra: The Kingdom and the Church of Seiros are worthy for fighting. I will crush them into very small pieces!
Linhardt: Crushing wouldn't yield a lot of pieces, but I guess it would get the job done. With the Professor we can't lose...probably.
Bernadetta: Oh no, are we fighting Lady Rhea? But she's scary! And she'll be really angry! But no way she can stay in her spooky beast form all the time...right?
Dorothea: If she could, she would have come and attacked the monastery as many times as she wanted.
Ferdinand: It may be wishful thinking, but perhaps it is a power that she can only access when the situation is dire. But whether she is the archbishop or the Immaculate One, we cannot be stopped! Half remains, but half is finished... We are certainly moving forward.
Hubert: No one can stop us from pushing forward. No one.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
With Derdriu now under Imperial control, the Leicester Alliance ceases to exist, and its remaining lords ally with the Empire. The Black Eagle Strike Force, now having conquered all of eastern FÃ³dlan, confidently moves to invade the Kingdom.

@Dialogue 
Hubert: ...And that concludes Count Bergliez's report.
Hubert: Just as Claude said, the old Alliance has willingly fallen under Imperial rule. However, knowing him, there is no telling what manner of poison could be waiting within. 
Hubert: Just as Your Majesty predicted, the old Alliance has willingly fallen under Imperial rule. However, even with Claude dead, there is no telling what manner of poison he left in his wake. 
Hubert: We must be careful not to expose any weakness.
Edelgard: Of course. Though it seems we can now attack the Kingdom without issue.
Hubert: True. However, you should know that Lord Arundel has entered Derdriu. It would seem he has already started collecting the Relics of the old Alliance...
Edelgard: Let him do as he pleases for now. It's not yet the time to chide him.
Hubert: Understood. As for the Kingdom... As we theorized, it is not entirely united. If we defeat the royal family of House Blaiddyd and a handful of other notable houses, it should fall under our control quite readily. Those we must target include the houses Fraldarius, Galatea, Gautier, and Charon.
Hubert: We have allies who are close to some of those lords. Perhaps that can be used to our advantage. Persuasion by tears or threats...Perhaps one would consent to act as an hostage? We must make good use of the tools given to us.
Edelgard: What about House Rowe in Arianrhod, the Fortress City? Will they not side with us?
Hubert: The head of House Fraldarius, Lord Rodrigue, has entered the city. It is possible that he has seized it.
Edelgard: I see. Then it might prove too difficult to strike Fhirdiad right away.
Hubert: Either way, when preparations are complete, we can begin our deployment into the Kingdom.
Edelgard: That part of the plan remains unchanged. Professor? Is something wrong?
Byleth: No, it's nothing.
Byleth: Many of those names are new to me.
Edelgard: Yes, I don't imagine you have much interest in a running list of noble names. But it matters not. The nobility and the weight of it all those names will be gone once the war is over.
Edelgard: This month, we must put all of our effort into preparing for battle. I'm counting on you, my teacher.

Edelgard: Aaah!
Byleth: ... 
Edelgard: Professor! You didn't hear anything just now, did you?
Byleth: Are you OK?
Edelgard: Of course I am! It's nothing...nothing at all.
Byleth: That was a cute shriek.
Edelgard: Cute?! Huh! Well, be that as it may, it is not your concern. It was nothing.
Byleth: Are you sure about that?
Edelgard: I told you it was nothing and I meant it.
Byleth: Really, very cute...
Edelgard: You seem to be trying your hardest to infuriate me. Don't you dare say that again! 
Edelgard: Cute?! Huh! Well, be that as it may, it is not your concern. It was nothing. 
Edelgard: It's just... Well, there was a rat. I don't enjoy the company of rats. I believe I've told you about this before...about when I was held captive beneath the palace. There were a lot of rats there. To this day, I just...
Byleth: What's that?
Edelgard: What?! Oh! Professor! Leave here at once! I recall now that Hubert needs to speak with me. I must change my clothes. Now. Whatever you do, don't look this way.
Byleth: I already saw it...
Edelgard: Aah! Then forget what you saw! That's an order!
Byleth: ...

@Conversation 
Edelgard: If the Alliance falls, then the Kingdom will... There's no time to waste. If we hesitate, we risk losing the initiative. I do think we should let the troops rest, though... We must maintain morale, Professor. And let's make sure this matter stays between us. If it gets out, I'll struggle to forgive even you.
Byleth: What matter?
Edelgard: Hmm... It seems you don't comprehend the consequences of angering the emperor.
Byleth: Understood. 
Edelgard: Thank you.



Hubert: Claude von Riegan. What an interesting character. Underneath that compassionate exterior, he was always cold and calculating. Ordinary fools run headlong into combat, without even considering the possibility of defeat. But to consider one's chances, and to prepare for plans to go awry--that takes real intelligence. I have to say, I am impressed beyond words.



Ferdinand: The majority is with us. This conflict will end soon. I am so moved by the Alliance nobles' decision. That is true nobility! Acting in accordance with the people's needs and wishes. As war drags on, those living near the front lines inevitably get the worst of it. We will not see such a peaceful resolution in Faerghus, I am afraid, as it is ruled by the royal family, not a council of nobles.



Linhardt: I've been exploring the Holy Mausoleum. It's quite interesting in there. There is a mechanism I believe would allow us passage into the Holy Tomb, but I'm unclear on how to activate it. My research hasn't turned up much. It may come down to asking the archbishop for details.
Byleth: Your research will find something. 
Byleth: That's a puzzler.
Linhardt: Indeed. We'll see if it's worth the trouble.



Caspar: Did you meet my father in Derdriu? I guess he'll be responsible for controlling the Riegan territory and maintaining popular support. Not really sure what all that means though...
Byleth: You should study more. 
Caspar: You're probably right. I'll do my best!
Byleth: It doesn't matter.
Caspar: Are you sure? I figured you'd say something about me having to study more. Oh, I get it. This is a test! I'm definitely gonna have to brush up.



Bernadetta: War isn't kind to you if you're a recluse. By the time you realize what's going on, you're already under attack. And if you're off by yourself, you can get killed with no one ever even finding out.
Byleth: Sounds like you're learning.
Byleth: Isn't that a little pessimistic? 
Bernadetta: Got me out of my room, at least! That's good, right?




Dorothea: The Leicester Alliance is no more. Three hundred years of history...gone and done. They write operas about events like this, you know. I'm sure they'll have a talent and beautiful songstress playing you. Probably for Edie as well. I wonder if there'll be romantic tension between your two characters, even if it's not historically accurate?

Dorothea: The Leicester Alliance is no more. Three hundred years of history...gone and done. They write operas about events like this, you know. I'm sure you'll be played by the most handsome actor of the time. Hearts will pound as he takes the stage. A diva will play Edie! You'll fall madly in love, even if it isn't historically accurate.



Petra: The Kingdom always is cold. I have hatred for the cold. Brigid is not cold. We have no Cold Spirit. Does the goddess of FÃ³dlan give protection from the cold? I am wishing I knew how to ask her...



Felix: Hmph. My father is holding Arianrhod secure. Our next battle will be there, against him, or in Fhirdiad, which the king is protecting.
Byleth: Can you fight them?
Felix: Ha! Don't underestimate me. I've been preparing for this for a long time.
Byleth: I'm counting on you. 
Felix: Hah. You just worry about yourself.



Ashe: Derdriu's fallen. The Alliance nobles have surrendered to the Empire. We made it through with as few losses as possible. Not bad, all things considered... But I doubt it'll be so easy to deal with Faerghus.



Sylvain: First Leicester and next Faerghus? Ah, that'll be really tough. Look, Professor... Fighting Faerghus? Isn't there some way we can come to an understanding?
Byleth: Maybe there is. 
Sylvain: Yeah, but Edelgard and her idiot sidekick haven't shown much desire to compromise, have they?
Byleth: No.
Sylvain: Harsh...but true. I don't see how we can avoid what's coming.
Sylvain: Truthfully, I hate the idea of planning to kill people I used to be so close with. I guess everybody feels that way though.



Mercedes: Oh, Claude. I'm so relieved that he managed to make it out alive. You'll be fighting the Kingdom next, right? Then the church? Isn't there some way we can do this without fighting Dimitri and Lady Rhea? I suppose not...
Mercedes: Oh, Claude. It's too late now, but it's such a shame... You'll be fighting the Kingdom next, right? Then the church? I guess Edelgard won't hesitate to cut Dimitri and Lady Rhea down...



Annette: We may be witnessing a key moment in history. Hundreds of years from now, your name and Edelgard's will be written in the history books, Professor!
Byleth: Perhaps. 
Byleth: That's a little embarrassing.
Annette: What, how? I think it's just amazing!
Annette: I wonder who will decide whether we did the right thing or not... Well, it won't be us, anyway. Probably the people of a future era.



Ingrid: While the battle with the Alliance is over, we still need to stay vigilant. Both the church and the Kingdom are not to be taken lightly. I have the feeling we'll draw their attention soon. Weapon prep and training are of the utmost importance now more than ever.



Lorenz: It seems all that praise of Claude's ingenuity was largely unfounded. A truly clever man would have realized defeat was inevitable and surrendered. Or, failing that, he could have rallied the Alliance nobles to secure a real fighting chance.





Raphael: I'm no noble, so it won't make much difference to me... But it hasn't really hit me yet that the Alliance is finished.





Ignatz: To think, I saw the end of the Leicester Alliance with my own eyes. I witnessed a turning point in the history of my homeland. I'm not sure how to express my feelings right now.
Byleth: Why not write about it?
Ignatz: No, I don't have a gift for words. But perhaps I'll tell my children someday, if I have any.
Byleth: Why not paint a picture? 
Ignatz: That's right, I'll paint it! The Fall of Derdriu.
Ignatz: So that posterity can remember our triumph.




Lysithea: The battle ended without House Ordelia getting involved. Although...I've no desire to continue on with my family, so from here on out, it's up to Edelgard. I have Claude to thank. Ultimately, this ended without the Alliance being entirely consumed by war. It's all thanks to Claude.



Lysithea: I have Claude to thank. Before the battle, he considered my precarious position and told me it wouldn't matter if we fell to the Empire. So when you invited me, I accepted without hesitation. Ultimately, this ended without the Alliance being entirely consumed by war. It's all thanks to Claude.



Marianne: I wonder... Was there really no way to end it without fighting Claude?
Byleth: It couldn't be helped. 
Marianne: You're probably right...
Byleth: It's better this way.
Marianne: I hope you're right...
Marianne: I suppose the only thing I can do for him now is pray...
Marianne: That he may live the rest of his life in happiness. 
Marianne: That he may rest in peace. 



Leonie: The worst part about going to battle is knowing you might have a friend fighting for the other side. You were a mercenary, Professor. Were you always prepared for that?
Byleth: Absolutely.
Leonie: Guess I need to learn. Won't make a very good mercenary otherwise, will I?
Byleth: I still hesitate. 
Leonie: That's reassuring. I don't think I'll ever get used to it.
Leonie: Fighting old friends--there's nothing worse. My hands shake just thinking about it.
Leonie: I'm glad Claude didn't die. Does that make me soft? 
Leonie: I didn't want Claude to die. Does that make me soft? 



Alois: I've lived at Garreg Mach Monastery for a few decades now. Still, the other day I got myself all turned around! There are so many secret rooms and hidden passages. Maybe I'll take the time to properly search the place. Care to join me? I expect it'd take a whole day.



Shamir: You're too soft. I'm talking about Claude. Our emperor mercilessly cuts down all those who stand in her way... But perhaps she is more tolerant of those who know their place.
Shamir: Our emperor mercilessly cuts down all those who stand in her way... Even the Master Tactician.



Hanneman: It seems Claude has disappeared...
Hanneman: Claude...lost in battle. My goodness.
Hanneman: Do you suppose this means the end of House Riegan? While the Crest of von Riegan is not terribly rare... The long linage of the von Riegan family will be broken.
Byleth:  It's just another consequence of war. 
Byleth:  We should mourn his death. 
Hanneman: Agreed. The poor boy...
Byleth: Does this pose an obstacle to your research?
Hanneman: No... At the very least, I think not. There are other, lesser Crests to research. Yet I am a human first and a scholar second. For now, I grieve the fallen and pray for those still living.



Manuela: You know as well as I do, the day's coming that we'll have to fight the archbishop and her knights. We've got some strong fighters here, sure. But even with all our training, I don't know if we can win. I just don't see how any of us can compete with the archbishop, say, turning into a monster.
Byleth: If we must fight, we will. 
Manuela: Yeah? What if that fight's to the death--yours and mine in particular?
Byleth: Sometimes it can be better to retreat. 
Manuela: That's exactly what I was saying. I've always appreciated how you listen to me.



Jeritza: Neither the emperor nor the Empire have my allegiance. It is all simply part of the agreement. There is no other reason for me to be here.



Anna: The Alliance is just...gone. It's hard to believe. The merchants of Derdriu all have nerves of steel. I'm sure they'll be up and running again in no time.



Randolph: Finally, the Kingdom... After that, we'll battle the church. I volunteered for monastery guard duty. It was more for my family than anything. But now, from the bottom of my heart, I want to see Her Majesty ruling this land. Even if it costs me my life, I will protect Garreg Mach!



Fleche: I just wanted to help out my brother, Randolph, so I aspired to be a soldier. My brother puts his life on the line to fight, so I'll put everything I have into it too. Eventually the enemy will attack, and when they do, we'll defend this place to the bitter end!



Ladislava: Your next opponents will be the Kingdom's army and the Knights of Seiros. Both fearsome foes. Put the mobility of my troops to good use, and let us protect the Kngdom's western battle front. When this month has ended, I'll depart. I pray that you have good luck in battle.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! You may already know this, but the Kingdom and the Alliance were once a single entity. The leaders of the Alliance, House Riegan, are actually a branch of the Blaiddyd royal family. In a way, it's just a battle of the part of Blaiddyd family tree that rose in rebellion against the Empire...

@Opening 
Following the Alliance's defeat, the Black Eagle Strike Force prepares to invade the Kingdom, but the Kingdom's new allies--the Knights of Seiros--begin to make an advance of their own. After appearing in Ailell, the Valley of Torment, and following the border south, the Knights of Seiros openly march to recapture the monastery at Garreg Mach.

Absorbing the Alliance brings the Empire one step closer to a unified FÃ³dlan. The Black Eagle Strike Force returns to Garreg Mach to plan its invasion of the Kingdom, unaware of the enemy lurking in the shadows.

@Intro 
Imperial Soldier: Raid from the north! Their flag bears the symbol of the Knights of Seiros! One of our troops has already intercepted them! Your Majesty, please give us your orders!
Edelgard: From the north? Interesting... Could it be they journeyed through Ailell, the Valley of Torment? Is the archbishop among the enemy ranks? If so, focus our attacks on her first.
Imperial Soldier: Understood!

Edelgard: Our enemy knows Garreg Mach from inside and out. They can come and go as they please. It would have been best if we had detected them sooner, but that can't be helped. Professor. We must hurry and intercept them ourselves. I'll leave the preparations to you.

Hubert: Heh. The battle looks to be rather cumbersome. We are still guarding all of Garreg Mach, but there are undoubtedly numerous secret passages and magic traps... There is still much about this place that we do not know. It is quite possible that they will attack from a location we cannot anticipate.
Edelgard: I must head out first to give my orders. I'll meet up with you soon. Call for General Randolph and General Ladislava! Hurry!



Seteth: It feels like only yesterday we called this place our home... We must show these fools the error of their ways. They shall pay for the sin of invading Garreg Mach...
Flayn: Oh, but the professor is fighting alongside our foe! The same one who saved my life...
Seteth: That is true... Though I find forgiveness difficult, we do owe that wayward soul a debt. However, the fact remains that because of the professor, Rhea has long been tormented. To think that the vessel of the goddess, entrusted with the Sword of the Creator, could go on to... Ah, it angers me to even think of it! All that has happened has changed Rhea. I imagine it has changed the professor as well. Even if we prevail, I doubt the church can ever fully return to the way it once was...
Flayn: Umm... Brother?
Seteth: Dear Flayn. I only brought you with me because you were so insistent. Still, no matter what happens, you must not go near the front lines. If something were to happen to you, it would utterly destroy me. You are my reason for breathing. Do you understand?
Flayn: I...I understand. If something were to happen to you, it would break my heart. I could not go on either. I cannot help but wonder...if there is a way to end this without fighting the professor...

@Battle 
Shamir: Our surprise attack on Garreg Mach was a success. Now we just need to break through past this point. 
Knight of Seiros: We were successful sneaking up on Garreg Mach. All that's left is to break through past this point. 
Alois: Lady Rhea and Catherine are holding back most of the Empire's army. Thereby leaving us, the expeditionary force, free to recapture the monastery! 
Knight of Seiros: The archbishop and Catherine are handling the bulk of the Imperial army. That gives us the chance to infiltrate the monastery! 
Edelgard: Our enemies have followed us even here. How unfortunate.
Hubert: Your Majesty, the enemy's movement is suspicious. They may have some tactic in mind.
Edelgard: If so, then let's face them without delay. Form defensive lines and hold them to the death! Strike down all who approach!
Hubert: Their troop composition is also strange. I would bet that they are concealing additional soldiers.

Hubert: The enemy is transporting large quantities of flammable material into the woods. They clearly intend to attack us with fire. We should do all we can to prevent it.
Edelgard: Troops waiting in the woods to ambush? We must avoid any suspicious areas as we advance.

Seteth: Now!
Edelgard: Come at me, so that I may put you out of your misery! (Flayn and several Church Soldiers appear on the right side of the map.
Flayn: The time is now! As long as we stand here, you shall not pass!

Alois: Now! Light it up! Like the goddess's fiery wrath, these flames will engulf our enemies. 
Knight of Seiros: Start the fire! 

Shamir: Great. A path has opened for us. 
Knight of Seiros: All right, a second route is open! Well done on this one too! 

Edelgard: If they break through here, the monastery will be â ...If that happens, all will be lost.

@Boss 
Shamir: How much of this can you take? It doesn't matter. We will be reclaiming Garreg Mach.

Shamir: I knew it... Shouldn't have let emotion get in the way...
Alois: Shamir, no! I will avenge you! 

Alois: You fiend, bearing ill will against the goddess. This place will be your grave!

Alois: Jeralt, I did it... I protected the monastery...
Shamir: Alois! How dare you die before me! 

Edelgard: Our enemy's plans is in ruins. Still, we must tread carefully.

%Byleth,Shamir
Shamir: You still align yourself with the emperor? What a shame. Let's make this quick. I don't want the loser to suffer.

%Alois,Shamir
Alois: Why, if it isn't Shamir! You're still with the knights. What a surprise.
Shamir: You're the surprise, Alois. I never thought I'd see the day you'd choose anyone over Rhea. Don't worry, I won't hold back. I owe an old ally the courtesy.
Alois: I won't either. I hope you're ready.

%Petra,Shamir
Shamir: I cannot bring myself to kill you... You're a princess of Brigid. A hostage of the Empire.
Petra: That was the truth in the past, but it is a different truth now, Shamir... I am...the will of the emperor!
Shamir: In that case, I won't hold back.

%Byleth,Alois
Alois: I can't believe you would try to kill lady Rhea. Jeralt must be turning in his grave. I can't protect you like I promised. I have to kill you and bury you with my own hands.

%Shamir,Alois
Shamir: So, you're the leader of the Knights of Seiros now? Good for you, Alois.
Alois: Indeed. You seem to be doing well for yourself too. The other knights are always cursing you.
Shamir: Don't worry, I won't hold back. I owe an old ally the courtesy.
Alois: I won't either. I hope you're ready.

@Boss
Flayn: This makes me terribly sad, but this is my duty, to which I must be true!

Flayn: Farewell, Professor. I do not imagine we shall ever meet again.

Flayn: Father, please forgive me... I am returning to Mother now...before you do...
Seteth: Flayn! Please, no! No! 

%Byleth,Flayn
Flayn: When I heard you were alive, Professor, I was so happy. But now... Now this? How can it be that you fight on that side? I cannot take your life, for I owe you mine, even now. And yet I cannot back away from this fight. When this is over, my brother and I will go into hiding. It is the only way.

@Boss
Seteth: Trespassing on holy ground is a grave sin indeed. You must atone for it with your life!

Seteth: I'm sorry, Rhea... For Flayn's sake, I must take my leave to retreat...

Seteth: I'm sorry, Flayn... I couldn't protect you...
Flayn: Father! Father, why?! Why?! 

%Byleth,Seteth
Seteth: It saddens me to face you on the field of battle, after all you've done for Flayn. I cannot approve of your actions. But I also cannot follow Rhea on her current course. It may not change anything, but allow me to make a promise to you. If Flayn and I survive this battle, we will withdraw from the world and leave you to do as you please.

@End
Edelgard: We fought them off. Good work, everyone. We've repelled the principle force of the knights and defended Garreg Mach! Hubert, I require a damage report at once.
Hubert: Yes, Your Majesty. We will have to make inquiries about the status of the main army.
Edelgard: Indeed. After all, it seems they had Rhea and Catherine fighting on their side.

^start 
Catherine: Lady Rhea. The unit that invaded the monastery has been completely driven away. We were able to make a clean sweep of those who came to attack us. However, I fear we can do nothing but retreat for now.
Rhea: What of Seteth and Flayn?
Catherine: Seteth and Flayn were able to escape in another direction. I have a message from them.
Seteth: I am sorry, Rhea. I fear we must return to a life in hiding. I detest that person with all my heart. However, Flayn's life is more important to me than all else. I pray that you will one day be free from the burden of your work...
Rhea: I see. As expected, I am the only one left. Mother, please wait for me. I promise that I will save you...The filthy thief who stole you from the Holy Tomb...I will crush them with my bare hands!

Catherine: Lady Rhea! I am afraid I must report...we lost Seteth and Flayn. We were able to make a clean sweep of those who came to attack us. The unit that invaded the monastery has been completely driven away...a bitter disappointment. I fear we can do nothing but retreat for you.
Rhea: Seteth... Flayn... First my mother, and now those two have been stolen away as well? Must you take everything from me?!
Catherine: Lady Rhea...
Rhea: No amount of repentance will bring your wretched soul salvation. You will be chained to the Valley of Torment...eternally walk the desert until the skin rots from your bones... I will ensure that you pay for your sins, Professor! In the name of the Nabateans, I swear it!
^end

@End 
Randolph: Edelgard... Your Majesty... I am so sorry...
Edelgard: Silence. We must tend to your wounds.
Randolph: It will do no good. I can't be saved... You must know that. Ladislava has also passed... The enemy has withdrawn... You are safe now...
Edelgard: Understood. Good work. Another loss on my watch... As more blood wets my feet, they grow heavier with each step. Remorse, resentment, despair... I have dispensed with all such things to come this far.
Hubert: And we must keep moving forward...
Edelgard: Hubert. Tell me the status of the enemy.
Hubert: The battle has ended in a draw with severe injuries on both sides. Some known commanders have been slain.
Hubert: The most worthy of mention among the dead was the second in command to Rhea herself, Seteth.
Hubert: With the death of Alois, the Knights of Seiros have taken a huge blow as well.
Hubert: Garreg Mach has not taken much damage, and so it would not be out of line to claim it as a victory for us.
Edelgard: Yes... We'll call that a victory. Although, I'm sure they will say the same.
Hubert: Yes, Your Majesty.



Bernadetta: Ugh, what a terrible opponent that was! Why is the church always like this?! How am I supposed to train for that?! It was way too scary!
Linhardt: When I saw the enemy enter Garreg Mach, I prepared myself mentally for death. I thought it would be a fine time to die, but I suppose it wasn't quite the time after all...
Petra: Our luck was good to have grabbed victory. The church has great strength. We must not have grief, but must keep fighting. Can we be fighting now?
Ferdinand: This was certainly a momentous victory. We lost a lot, but we also gained a lot. Certain lords in the Kingdom have examined the situation again and decided to join our cause. Changing their fealty based on just one battle... They are all a disgrace to the nobility!
Dorothea: Today, our enemy held many faces I knew well... If we must fight to the death with that kind of opponent, what will become of this world?
Caspar: There's no stopping me! I'm ready go strike the Kingdom here and now! Everyone must see that we can easily unite FÃ³dlan! Don't you think?

Edelgard: Excellent job, everyone. The battle is over now.
Edelgard: Professor, the battle is over now. 
Edelgard: While we have sustained heavy losses, our foe has suffered far more.
Hubert: Although not exactly as planned, a win is a win. It may be safe to say that there will be no more obstacles on our way to the next battle.
Edelgard: We will break through the Tailtean Plains and then set course for Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital. The final chapter of our fight with the Kingdom and the church is close at hand.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
It is Imperial Year 1185. Half a decade has passed since Emperor Edelgard ascended the Imperial throne, yet the continent of FÃ³dlan still remains lost in a tempest of turmoil and bloodshed. In the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, King Dimitri has welcomed Archbishop Rhea and her knights, who were driven out of Garreg Mach, to the Kingdom capital. As they work to build a unified front, the war with the Empire rages on to the west. Meanwhile, Claude, leader of the Alliance, staves off Imperial intervention by strategically stirring up conflicts between Leicester lords in an effort to feign neutrality. As events unfold, Edelgard and her Black Eagle Strike Force begin to take action in an attempt to break the war's current state of deadlock.

@Dialogue 
???: You... How long do you intend to sleep? Your body is awake. Your eyes must open now, and you must find the strength to stand upon those legs of yours. Like so much rain, a pool of blood has fallen to the ground... As spears and arrows pierce the earth, it weeps. And even now...it weeps. In order to survive, they kill. And so, the people of this world are lost in an abyss of suffering. They weep as well. The only one who truly knows the nature of such things is I... Or rather, you.
Byleth: I'm still sleepy.
???: You are a complete and utter fool! Have you not changed one bit?!
Byleth: Who?
???: Excuse me?! Are you saying you have forgotten who I am? How dare you!
???: Get on your feet. Right now! I'll coddle you no more! You are just like a child, always needing me to hold your hand...

Villager: Hey! A-are you awake?
Byleth: Where am I?
Villager: Weâre in a village at the base of the monastery. What are you doing in a place like this?
Byleth: Who are you?
Villager: Iâm just a villager here. What are you doing in a place like this?
Villager: I honestly didnât expect to find someone floating away down the river... Garreg Mach is upstream of here, but that place was abandoned.
Byleth: What do you mean?
Villager: Huh? You donât know? The Church of Seiros isnât there anymore. Though there have been some folks still living there in the five years since... Well, you know. Regardless, the Imperial Army has taken over now.
Byleth: Five years?
Byleth: What year is it?
Villager: Um, are you feeling all right? You didnât hit your head or anything did you? Itâs the Ethereal Moon of the year 1185. Itâs been nearly five years since the monastery fell. Tomorrow was supposed to be the Millennium Festival, but whoâs got time to think about things like that?
Byleth: The millennium festival...
Villager: Uh, yeah, thatâs what I said. But with the war and the archbishop still missing and all, I doubt thereâs a soul to be found who has enough blessings worth counting.

Villager: Hey! Slow down, will ya? Where do you think youâre going?
Byleth: The monastery.
Villager: Are you crazy?! The Imperial Army is there! Come on, I promise I wonât say youâre a coward. Just forget about going anywhere near the monastery.

Villager: You just remember I tried to stop you, got it? Itâs not on my conscience if you wind up dead.
Byleth: My students are waiting for me.
Villager: Students? You really are crazy, arenât you? There arenât any kids anywhere near that place anymore.
Byleth: No need to worry about me.

Villager: Unbelievable...

@Dialogue 
Edelgard: Five years ago to the day... If things had continued on as they were, today would have been the Millennium Festival.

Edelgard: Halt! Who's there?!

Edelgard: It can't be! Professor? Is it really you? But I searched everywhere and never found a trace! My teacher... what have you been doing all this time? Where have you been?
Byleth: I was sleeping.
Byleth: I was dead.
Edelgard: Joking?! At a time like this?! You do realize it's been five years since you disappeared!  Do you have any idea how guilty I felt? How broken my heart was? I searched high and low after you vanished! Although there was no proof, I somehow knew you were still alive. All this time, I led everyone as best I could, and fought with all my heart. It's been a difficult path to walk alone.

Edelgard:  Welcome back, my teacher. I'm so happy that you're safe. Five years... Such a short time, but it fells like an eternity ago. Do you... still feel the way you did all those years ago? You said that you would fight at my side no matter how many enemies we should amass. As for me, my resolve has not faltered. I'm determined as ever to see this through to the end. I will defeat the false goddess. I will save this world from those creatures and give humanity its freedom back.

Edelgard: So, my teacher, are you prepared to stand with me?
Byleth: I am. 
Edelgard: I...I thank you. Truly. Now then, I assume you understand the situation at hand, yes?
Byleth: I really was asleep all this time...
Edelgard: Another joke. Or...are you telling the truth? I suppose you must be. In that case, I'll tell you all that has transpired as you slumbered these past five years.

Edelgard: ...And that is where we are now. The war is at a stalemate. Dimitri is the new King of Faerghus. It's clear that his territory will continue to support the Church. Meanwhile, Claude's leadership has thrown the Alliance into chaos. He maintains neutrality in their internal conflict. The situation has created a deadlock. We've been awaiting an opportunity for our squadron to return to the monastery. With you in the fray, I believe the state of the war will shift immediately. The Church, as well as the Kingdom and the Alliance... The time has come to eliminate them all.
Byleth: The Kingdom and the Alliance...
Edelgard: Although we were of different houses, we were companions who lived and learned together. Some of our ranks are hesitant to battle against them. However, knowing that you're alive is sure to raise their spirits.
Byleth: The Church of Seiros...
Edelgard: Rhea, Seteth, the knights, and the others are in prime condition. They've set up their base within the Kingdom capital. The Immaculate One and her family have yet to fight on the front lines. However, we must eventually face and defeat them. It would mean a great deal to have you with us when the time comes.

Edelgard: Good. Well then, I believe it's time for a little reunion. The Black Eagle Strike Force never lost faith. They knew you were alive and have been awaiting your return. Let's not keep them waiting any longer.

Hubert: Well now. That face is certainly familiar. I am glad to see you alive and well, Professor.
Bernadetta: Professor, it's me, Bernie! Do you remember me? I can't believe you're here!
Caspar: I can't believe it! Is this a dream? Can we really be this lucky?!
Petra: This is not dreaming. Our professor is with us again!  Welcome to the back! I mean, welcome back!
Ferdinand: Our group isn't the same without you. I am overjoyed to see you again!
Dorothea: It's been so long. Seeing you again fills my heart with hope.
Linhardt: Great, now everything will be easy.  Um, that's great you're safe, Professor. I'm deeply, deeply moved.
Edelgard: Quite the reunion, isn't it, Professor? Everyone's happy to see you.
Caspar: Come on, Edelgard. You must be happier than all of us combined!

Caspar: She took it really hard when you disappeared, Professor.
Ferdinand: Of course, we did our very best in your absence. And there was never a day that we doubted you would return to us.
Dorothea: Edelgard has been leading us as emperor. But...after you disappeared, it became apparent that you were her anchor.
Petra: It gives me regret to be admitting this, but...our power is not enough. The only one who can be meeting Edelgard's expectations...is you, Professor.
Linhardt: Most impressive of all is your uncanny ability to bring a smile to everyone's face.
Hubert: In the years since you vanished, we have not lost anyone from our ranks.
Edelgard: We all longed for your presence and your leadership. Myself included.
Hubert: It seems fitting to view this as a new beginning for the Black Eagle Strike Force. We already have our target.
Edelgard: Yes. We must eliminate the Alliance before moving on to fight the Kingdom and the Church. However, that doesn't necessarily mean we must occupy the entirety of the Alliance. House Riegan stands against the Empire... Therefore, our target is Derdriu, the Aquatic Capital.
Hubert: We must cross the Airmid River, which separates the Empire and the Alliance. To do that, we must take the largest bridge across it. The Great Bridge of Myrddin. Myrddin connects the monastery and the Imperial capital to the east. It is the shortest route there.
Edelgard: An Alliance stronghold has been built at the Great Bridge. We'll take that and then head north. At the same time, we must defeat the one who defends it, Judith von Daphnel. If we can also take control of Daphnel territory, it would be greatly beneficial to us. Prepare yourselves. The next battle will be a momentous one. Join me, my friends, as we begin our journey to bring peace and solace to this war-ravaged world.

@Conversation 
Edelgard: Professor... I'm sorry to have dragged you into the fight again so soon after our reunion. But you appeared at a most opportune time. I'm truly humbled by your support, my teacher. Thank you.
Byleth: You can count on me.
Edelgard: And so I will. I'm hoping your ability from five years prior are still intact.
Byleth: I hope I'm not rusty...
Edelgard: You may be worried, but you shouldn't be. You always manage to pull through.
Edelgard: Make sure you're ready to head out, OK?



Hubert: Allow me to brief you on the details of our situation. The Empire firmly controls the western portion of Faerghus. However, the central and eastern regions continue to put up heavy resistance. The strongholds in these regions are Arianrhod, the Fortress City, and Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital. We cannot control Faerghus until we have taken both of these cities. As for the Alliance, Houses Gloucester and Ordelia seem predisposed to to capitulate to us. However, due to interference from Houses Riegan and Goneril, we have yet to secure their cooperation. Claude obviously hopes to keep the Alliance whole through diplomacy. But because we have had to focus our efforts against the church until now, our forces have yet to meet his. We have only recently begun to take the fight to Alliance territory.



Ferdinand: The last five years have been difficult at times. My relationship with Edelgard is rather contentious, due to the incident with my father. Nevertheless, I cannot abandon my family's duties. As Duke Aegir, I must play my part in the Imperial army. Edelgard intends to abolish the nobility, but I know I can dissuade her from doing so.



Linhardt: Professor! Do you know how happy I was to hear you were still alive? I'll tell you how happy--for the past two days, I haven't had my morning or my afternoon naps.
Byleth: Morning...nap? 
Linhardt: Yes?
Byleth: You were taking those naps every day?
Linhardt: Well, as long as we weren't marching. Can't sleep much then...but it's not for want of trying...
Linhardt: By the way, with Professor Hanneman not around... I've occupied his room. So I am well equipped to perform research on you. Isn't that exciting? 



Caspar: All right, I'm ready to fight! Let's do this!
Byleth: Whoa, slow down.
Caspar: You're right! I gotta keep it under control or I'm gonna wear myself out too quickly. Maybe I'll just get rid of a few monsters...or is that too risky right before a mission?
Byleth: I'm counting on you. 
Caspar: Leave it to me! I can take on the whole...most of the enemy's army!
Caspar: I know my limits now, Professor!



Bernadetta: Are we leaving for battle? I heard it's a long march. But it's fine! I've had plenty of time to stay inside lately, so I think it's time I...went out. Yeah! I can do this. No more Bernie-bear!
Byleth: Bernie-bear?
Bernadetta: Oh yeah. People call me Bernie-bear since I hole up in my den all the time. Not anymore though!
Byleth: That's the spirit. 
Bernadetta: Yes! But, um. Please don't put me up front, OK?



Dorothea: Laaa-la-laaa-la-laaa... Professor! Oh my! It's so good to see you. These days, so many old friends seem to be disappearing. But you... You're here! It's incredible to see you again after five years! I have a feeling your name will go down in history.



Petra: Edelgard is controlling the Empire. She is putting the pressure on the Kingdom and Alliance. Empire and religion are at open war. It will be...difficult for us at first. But corrupt nobles are many. That means the common people will rebel and be joining our side. With you, Professor, the battle tides will...ah, will turn. I have certainty.



Felix: For five years, I've fought for the Empire. I've cut down hordes of enemies. Now I have the same look in my eyes that the boar used to have in his. The look of a savage beast who loves nothing but destruction and violence.
Byleth: I don't see that look in your eyes.
Felix: I hope not.
Byleth: You're right. 
Felix: Hmph. I can hardly hold it against him anymore.
Felix: You and Edelgard must not disappoint me. Mark my words. The future you're building had better be worth all this bloodshed.



Ashe: Since you came back, everyone's been smiling. Just you being here makes an incredible difference. I can't express how reassuring it is to see you.



Sylvain: Hey, Professor. It's been a really long time, hasn't it? The last five years have been full of heartbreak-not from girls...but friends and family becoming enemies. One of the things that kept me going was the hope you'd return, and now here you are. A lot has changed, but you're back, and it's the first time I can remember being happy in a while.



Mercedes: I have good friends in both the Alliance and Faerghus, so this fighting weighs heavily on me... I can't bear the thought of battling the Knights of Seiros to the death! I have to keep my chin up though, right? Let's press on together, Professor.



Annette: My father used to be a knight in service of the royal family of Faerghus. For a time he was at the monastery, but apparently, he's back in Faerghus serving as a knight again. Which means if I fight with this family, I'll eventually have to face my own father...
Byleth: If you want to leave, now is the time.
Annette: Don't say that! I know what I'm doing and I'm ready for anything.
Byleth: Does that frighten you? 
Annette: Terribly. But...I've accepted my fate. I'm ready for anything.
Annette: Of course, if at all possible, I would prefer not to fight my father. This is the path I chose. I have no regrets.



Ingrid: His Highness, the new king, is in process of unifying the Kingdom under his command. His powerful army has joined forces with the Knights of Seiros, who moved their seat to Faerghus. And now they're presenting a unified front against the Imperial army. They're our greatest enemy, absolutely.
Byleth: I wonder if we can win.
Ingrid: Presently, it's doubtful. That's why I'm in favor of first capturing Alliance lands.
Byleth: Can you fight against your homeland? 
Ingrid: I don't relish the idea, but there's no turning back now. For now, we should focus our efforts on the Alliance. The Kingdom and church can come afterwards.
Ingrid: Judith, who defends the Great Bridge of Myrddin, is a formidable opponent. We can't afford to drop our guard.



Lorenz: House Gloucester will remain staunchly neutral in this war. Even if we press into Alliance territory. My father is no threat to the Empire. Lady Edelgard surely understands that. The Great Bridge of Myrddin, however, is another story. I hear it is held by Judith of House Daphnel. She is renowned for her military prowess. We would do well not to underestimate her.



Raphael: Hey, Professor! What have you been up to for five years? Hope you haven't gone soft! I got myself into perfect shape. Took all five years of pushing my muscles to the limit, but look!
Byleth: You look very strong. 
Raphael: You bet I do! You gotta get training if you want to catch up!
Byleth: I don't really see a difference...
Raphael: What?! Can't you see my muscles? Do I gotta undress so you can get a better look?



Ignatz: I thought you might be at the monastery. That's why I made my way here. I decided to follow your path, because I believed in you. But then you vanished. Now that you've returned, I have my guiding light once again. Welcome back, Professor!



Lysithea: I'm relieved you're here, Professor. It seems we've reached a stalemate on the war front. I admit I'm feeling apprehensive about fighting the Alliance...
Byleth: You have to cast aside your doubts. 
Lysithea: I agree. It's time to shelve my personal feelings and focus on the bigger picture.
Byleth: You don't have to do anything if you don't want to.
Lysithea: No. I have to shelve my personal feelings. There are bigger things at play here.
Lysithea: I'll fight at full force. I'm counting on you to lead us to victory, Professor.



Marianne: My adoptive father sent me here so our family name would be known. He doesn't care which side wins, the Empire or the Alliance. However, even if he tells me to come home, I intend to stay. I want to see this new world Edelgard dreams of.



Leonie: I'm so glad to see you're all right. I really regretted not being able to keep the promise I made to my mentor.
Byleth: Mentor?
Leonie: Captain Jeralt, obviously! I'm still his first and greatest apprentice, you know!
Byleth: Promise? 
Leonie: Captain Jeralt told me that if anything should happen to him, then I should stick by you.
Leonie: I'm going to do just what he asked. I'll be right here to support you from now on.



Alois: Ah!
Byleth: Ah?
Alois: At long last, we meet again! I knew you were alive. I knew you could survive. And five years on, you arrive! We're reunited! I'm glad I kept watch for you in the downstream villages all that time. I was so devoted to finding you that I left the Knights of Seiros. Now I serve no one... Other than you! I'll protect you, just as I promised Captain Jeralt I would all those years ago.



Shamir: What's that look on your face? Surprised to see me? I'm a mercenary. Always have been. Even when I was with the Knights of Seiros. I never was too attached to FÃ³dlan. I was considering leaving soon. But I might change my mind if you're around.



Hanneman: You've finally joined us, haven't you? I attached myself to the Imperial army as well. Seemed the thing to do. I feel I owe it to Edelgard to set my past feelings about the Empire aside. I am happy to help her. It's strange, isn't it? After five years, the three Professors are together once more. I am most curious though. You say you were asleep for five whole years? Incredible. Perhaps this is another effect of your Crest. I do look forward to investigating you in greater detail.
Byleth: We can talk about that. 
Hanneman: Wonderful news! I am most excited to begin. We must find the time, of course.
Byleth: Uh, maybe later...
Hanneman: I'll have to be content with observing you wherever you go, then. I cannot waste any opportunity!



Manuela: After the battle five years ago, the Imperial army occupied Garreg Mach. The cathedral and several other buildings were destroyed, but... We've done some repair work here and there, and we're using the buildings as a base of operations. As for me? Well, the church moved its headquarters to Faerghus, and I've seen no reason to follow. When I returned to Enbarr, I received a summons from Her Majesty, and I chose to answer.



Jeritza: You survived. How very fortunate... Were you dead, I wouldn't be able to fight you. But you are very much aliveânow I've a chance to kill you.



Anna: There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals.

Randolph: Ah, a new face. I am Randolph von Bergliez. I'm the guardian of this place. Wait a moment... I'm sure I've seen you somewhere before.
Byleth: Five years ago...
Byleth: I'm a professor.
Randolph: Ah yes! You're Her Majesty's professor. You're alive?! Um... Oh, this is my little sister, Fleche. She's just a rookie, but she's helping me as my assistant.
Fleche: H-Hello. I'm Fleche von Bergliez. It's nice to meet you. I know I'm inexperienced, but I'm going to do my best. You can count on me to look after my big brother!
Randolph: I heard you're planning to march into Alliance territory. I'll be here to guard the fort.

Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! What's that? Do I have brothers in the church? You really are well informed! My older twin works for the Knights of Seiros, but I think he's just a grunt. Not a noble gate keeper like yours truly. Unlike me, he's very devout. He left the Empire a long time ago.

@Opening 
The newly crowned king of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, Dimitri, has declared fealty to the Church of Seiros and is raising an army in preparation for all-out war with the Empire. As the leader of the Alliance, Claude maintains a facade of neutrality amidst infighting between those who support and those who oppose the Empire. Meanwhile, the Black Eagle Strike Force plans to capture Alliance territory before Edelgard takes the war to the Kingdom and Church of Seiros. With sights set on capturing Derdriu at the center of House Riegan's territory, she leads a march across the Great Bridge of Myrddin to establish a bridgehead.

The Black Eagle Strike Force has an unexpected encounter with someone thought to have died years prior. Amidst the joy, your forces prepare to invade Alliance territory.

@Intro 
Hubert: We are about to commence the attack on the Great Bridge of Myrddin. But first, allow me a moment of your time.
Byleth: What do you need?
Hubert: It is something I can only ask of you. Listen well... It concerns Lady Edelgard's uncle. The regent of the Empire, Lord Arundel. Although he is currently cooperating with Her Majesty, he maintains his own sizable military troops. It seems to me that his plans differ from our own. I assume you recall a certain group's scheming from five years ago. Solon and Kronya... They both served Lord Arundel.
Byleth: Why must we cooperate?
Byleth: He must be dealt with.
Hubert: Professor, I understand how you must be feeling, considering what they did to your father. I know it must be foul to even consider cooperating with their kind. However, their power is essential for us at present. Edelgard also strongly opposed the idea at first. Our enemy is the Church of Seiros itself. It cannot be toppled with the Empire's might alone. Those working under Lord Arundel are extremely hostile toward the church. And the enemy of our enemy is... Well, I think you sufficiently understand by now.
Byleth: Are you sure that's a good idea?
Hubert: Until all of FÃ³dlan is united, it is a necessary evil. As for how we deal with them afterward...time will tell. Regardless, Her Majesty and I wish to join our power with yours. 
Hubert: You should know that in her heart, Her Majesty regards that group as enemies of herself and her family. They used her father, the former emperor, as a puppet and murdered her siblings with their vile experimentation. I believe Her Majesty may have told you some of this herself. That is why this was a...very painful decision for her to make. 
Hubert: I will do all I can to ensure her suffering is not in vain, and I hope I can count on you to do the same. As for all I have told you, please keep it in mind as we march forward. More importantly, I implore you to fight as best you can for Edelgard... From the bottom of my heart, I beg this of you.

@Battle 
Edelgard: We'll be capturing the Great Bridge of Myrddin, a key strategic location of the Leicester Alliance. Claude will surely be sending reinforcements, so we must prevail before they arrive.
Hubert: Our opponent is Judith, the so-called Hero of Daphnel. We can handle her. So long as we don't get careless.
Judith: The boy said to run if I was in danger, but... I could never do that. I'll hold out until reinforcements arrive!

Leonie: Judith! I'm so glad you're safe! Claude sent me here with reinforcements! 
Alliance General: Sorry to keep you waiting, Judith! We're the reinforcements! 
Acheron: Why do I have to put up with orders from that false leader...
Leonie: Because you're from the smallest noble house in all the Alliance, you whiner! 
Edelgard: Enemy reinforcements... We didn't finish in time. Don't let them secure the ballista!

@Boss 
Ignatz: I am helping Claude build the future of FÃ³dlan!

Ignatz: Ungh... I should have known this would happen...
Judith: Ignatz! Damn it... Such a good kid. He died too young...

Leonie: Judith, I'm sorry... I leave the rest to you...
Judith: Leonie! You had such a full life ahead of you... I wish I could take your place...

Leonie: Doesn't matter who you are. I won't hold back, and I won't fall to the Empire!

Leonie: You're all Captain Jeralt's enemies! And I will avenge him here!

Judith: This is it... Claude, I'm sorry. I couldn't defend the bridge. All who are able, retreat!
Edelgard: Don't let her escape! If we take her out now, the Daphnel territory will be ours! That will allow us to march safely through the Alliance.

Judith: Avoided death yet again, huh? I'll join Claude and prepare for a counter attack!
Hubert: Judith's escape will widen the battlefront. Our strategy's failed...

Judith: Guh, it looks like I'm done for. Claude... I'm sorry...
Leonie: Judith! No! 

Acheron: The knights on the other side of this bridge are mine. I can't just let you cross!

Acheron: Guh... If only I had joined the Empire...sooner...

%Byleth,Ignatz
Ignatz: We can't place the future of FÃ³dlan in Edelgard's hands. If you're allied with the Empire, I have no choice but to fight you.

%Raphael,Ignatz
Raphael: Outta my way, Ignatz! I don't wanna have to fight you!
Ignatz: Stop deluding yourself. You joined the Empire. Didn't you consider the consequences? I don't want to fight you either, Raphael! But this is war.
Raphael: Ignatz...

%Byleth,Leonie
Leonie: Professor! You know Captain Jeralt's killer was connected to the Empire! Why did you side with them?! Answer me, traitor!

%Lorenz,Acheron 
Lorenz: Acheron! What a pleasant surprise! I was concerned I might have to kill someone decent.
Acheron: Ha! House Gloucester is already finished. I've already taken control of your land!
Lorenz: That's quite enough of your spinning, Weathervane. Time for you to die.

@End 
Edelgard: Alliance soldiers, Judith has fallen! Further conflict is futile! If you surrender, your lives will be spared. Lay down your weapons immediately.

Edelgard: You have all fought well. With this victory, we now have a foothold in the Alliance. The Imperial Army will cross the Airmid River and push the front lines forward. The fight will continue, but do not allow that to stop you from taking pride in our hard-won victory.
Ferdinand: Ah, this should put a stop to one of Edelgard's choice phrases. Well done, Professor. I believe it was "if only the professor were here, we could forge ahead and change the tides of this war."
Edelgard: Ferdinand. It is not necessary to tell the professor such things.
Caspar: We're not the only ones benefiting! The whole Imperial Army is stronger now!
Linhardt: Yes, it seems the Empire finally has both of its legs to stand on. Don't you agree?
Edelgard: You make it sound as though I can't run the Empire on my own. Perhaps it's more apt to say that the pegasus has recovered its horn.
Dorothea: Judith of Daphnel... What a magnificent warrior. I'm happy to have the professor back just like old times, but I don't think I'll ever get used to this cruel exchange of lives...
Petra: When there is something you must not be conceding, you must keep fighting! The fighting has been continuing for five years, but now I am again witnessing the professor's power.
Bernadetta: I hate fighting! But...with the professor here...maybe it's slightly less terrible? Oh, but everyone is working so hard! Stop it, Bernie, you can't be the only one complaining!
Hubert: I'm glad to see everyone so inspired. It seems the reappearance of the professor has done much to raise your morale.
Edelgard: Do you not feel the same, Hubert? Come now, be honest with yourself. Now, we must take advantage of the situation and blaze ahead. Our path is still a long one.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Together, the people of FÃ³dlan relish the beauty of the brilliant moon overhead as another year ends. They recall sad partings and new acquaintances alike, but each person must still walk their chosen path alone. With each day, the presence of spring grows stronger and yet a lone moon still haunts the sky. A silent reminder, perhaps, of some inescapable truth...

@Dialogue 
Edelgard: We somehow managed to escape.
Hubert: This is one of the Imperial army's provisional camps. Here we can organize our forces.
Edelgard: Before we go any further, I want all of you to really ask yourselves if you're certain you wish to join us. As expected, Flayn has chosen to leave our ranks.
Caspar: When I saw our professor running off, I ran about as fast as I could to catch up.
Petra: Caspar. Death finds those who run without thinking. You gave no thought to the war fog.  My grandfather was the leader of Brigid, and I hope for us to be allies with the Empire. I will be staying.
Bernadetta: W-Was this a good idea? Did I make the right choice? Oh, but my family is part of the Empire, and our professor is here...
Caspar: You're fine here with us, Bernie. Though it's true that certain houses were against the Imperial princess...
Ferdinand: I assume you are referring to my family. I must believe that the conclusion I came to was the correct one.  You are the emperor now... I am the only one left who is qualified to guide you at this point.
Linhardt: I'm only here because I know it would be troublesome to stand against you.
Dorothea: I'm not just here for you, Edie. I'm here to follow our dear professor. Of course, I don't have any territory to offer... so Hubie may not even want me here.
Hubert: The greater our numbers, the better. Your reasons for being here are of no consequence.
Edelgard: I think I understand where you are coming from. But now, I wish to hear of your resolve. Like you, I have risen to meet my destiny. I cut this path, and I will see it through to the end. Following me is akin to pointing a sword to the goddess herself. One misstep, and we fall to ruin. You have now witnessed the archbishop's true self. She is a cruel beast. Those who rule this world use that beast's power to fabricate miracles, all to control those who blindly believe in the goddess. They conceal the truth and force their lies on the nobility. They mercilessly annihilate anyone who defies them. I know this because I have lived it. After what you have seen, is there any room for doubt? The Church of Seiros has great influence and power. Their control over the lords of the Kingdom and the Alliance is nearly absolute. We are the only ones who can stop this indomitable enemy that has plagued our world for ages. We fight for humanity! For all of FÃ³dlan! If you dare walk this path with me, take your first step. It's now or never!
Edelgard: Thank you, my friends. We are the true face of the Empire, and we will triumph!

Hubert: That was incredible, Lady Edelgard.
Edelgard: Thank you. Honestly, I'm relieved. They really chose to follow me... I was resolved to move forward alone if I had to, but in my heart I hoped it wouldn't come to that.
Hubert: So long as I am here, you will never be alone. Please do not forget that. And...it would seem that the professor also has a key role to play in this.
Edelgard: You're right. Now, I must speak with our teacher. Please, make preparations. The messenger should be here shortly.
Hubert: Consider it done.

Edelgard: Professor, may I speak with you?
Byleth: Of course.
Edelgard: I appreciate it. I...
Byleth: What's wrong?
Edelgard: I'm just...anxious. It feels like the weight of this burden is crushing me. At this very moment, on my orders, I'm starting a war. An army far larger than the one that attacked the Holy Tomb last month will soon be locked in battle. Long-devised strategies are unfolding across FÃ³dlan. Leaders are deciding their loyalties and preparing to fight... So many generals and soldiers will die. It's inevitable that civilians will get caught up in the chaos as well. There will be countless casualties. With a single command, the flames of war will rage across all corners of this realm. And I am the one who is giving the order.
Byleth: This is the path you chose, isn't it?
Edelgard: Yes, it is. There is no turning back.
Byleth: Do you wish to stop?
Edelgard: No. There is no turning back now.
Edelgard: No matter how much blood flows at my feet, I will not relent. We must break the bonds that the depraved church has placed on FÃ³dlan. These sacrifices will allow us to create a future where we never need sacrifice again. It may seem contradictory, but it's the only way. Heh. Listen to me. I made up my mind long ago. Yet here I am, seeking your approval. Tell me the truth, my teacher. Are you happy with your decision to stand by my side. Unlike me, you can still walk away from all of this. This path leads to the death of the archbishop and the servants of the church. Can you live with that?
Byleth: I chose this path too.
Edelgard: I never thought... I'm sorry. It was a foolish question. I believe in you, professor. And you believed in me. With that knowledge, I have the strength to keep fighting. Let's go... There's something I need to say to Hubert.

Hubert: Your Majesty, the latest report indicates that our main army is advancing as planned. Also, the preparations for your manifesto are almost complete.
Byleth: Manifesto?
Edelgard: We will distributing our manifesto to every lord within FÃ³dlan. We will expose the dark side of the Church of Seiros and the foul practices of the nobles from the Kingdom and the Alliance. We will force the people of FÃ³dlan to open their eyes to the truth and relinquish any remaining conviction to unite against the empire. Certain nobles have already offered their support.
Hubert: There are other nobles who oppose the church. We will condemn those who deserve condemnation and forgive those who deserve forgiveness. We have already purged some of the Imperial nobles who are morally rotten. My father among them. How unfortunate.
Edelgard: And soon we will invade and conquer Garreg Mach. Our main army has already departed the Imperial capital. They will arrive at the monastery in two weeks' time. There, we will join forces with them. As for us, I'd like your opinion on how we should be positioned within the army.
Byleth: We are the Imperial shield.
Byleth: We are the Imperial sword.
Hubert: Your majesty wishes to fight alongside the professor, correct? In that case, you will not be incorporated into the Empire's main army. Your squad can move freely about the battlefield under supervision of the Imperial forces... That would be most prudent.
Edelgard: Now that I'm the emperor, we can't let it slip that I'm following your command in battle, Professor.
Hubert: I fully object to the notion of you fighting on the front lines.
Edelgard: Hubert. We've already discussed this.
Hubert: My apologies... I overstepped.
Edelgard: Now that the details are settled, all that's left is come up with a name for ourselves. In honor at our time at the academy, how about we call ourselves the Black Eagle Strike Force?
Byleth: I love it. 
Edelgard: I'm so happy you feel that way. I must confess that I spent all night thinking about it.
Byleth: I hope we can live up to that name.
Edelgard: With you as our leader, I'm confident we will. To me, that name represents us soaring toward a new dawn, freely as an eagle.
Byleth: Isn't that a bit much? 
Edelgard: It seems we have differing tastes. I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree.
Edelgard: I'll leave it to you to prepare the Black Eagle Strike Force for departure.

@Conversation 
Edelgard: We will join forces with the main army and attack Garreg Mach. It's a fortress built on steep ground, but it's never seen battle. That means we don't know much about it from a military perspective. But if we use all of the power at our disposal, we will capture it.
Byleth: I wonder if we can win.
Byleth: We have to try. 
Edelgard: From a purely mathematical standpoint, we most certainly have the power to win. If the battle becomes a clash of beasts with inhuman strength... You will be our only hope. I believe in you. I'm relying on you to lead the Black Eagle Strike Force to victory.



Hubert: It is not up to Her Majesty to bring the students to our cause. That task falls to you. Those who have forsaken their homelands to join the Empire will be feeling...vulnerable. You are uniquely able to provide emotional support. Please use that gift to guide others down the path that Lady Edelgard has laid before us. I ask you to do this from the bottom of my heart.



Ferdinand: I asked Edelgard what happened to my father. He was dismissed as prime minister and is under arrest in the Imperial capital. He always was a greedy, arrogant man. Some would say that this is the fate he deserves. And yet I cannot help but feel indignant. After all his hard work for the Empire, to be disgraced like this! I am conflicted, Professor. I do not know what to do. As the next Duke Aegir, should I follow Edelgard into battle?



Linhardt: The most important nobles in the Empire are known for taking power from the previous emperor, my father included. I didn't think it possible that the Imperial princess could ascend the throne so easily. However, it seems that both my father and Caspar's are supporting Edelgard... Having both the Minister of Domestic Affairs and Minister of Military Affairs on your side gives you total control over the Empire's military and finances. They must have been making preparations for quite some time without anyone noticing...



Caspar: That could have gotten dangerous fast. If I stayed at the monastery, I would've had to fight my father! We aren't especially close, but he's not an opponent I'd want to face. I'd almost rather fight a monster! Anyway, it looks like he's going to be leading the western units. I wonder if we'll wind up fighting the Kingdom's army, and who decided to fight for the church...



Bernadetta: I don't even get my own room here! At least I had that at home. But speaking of home, Hubert told me something. He said my father was stripped of his title. I guess he did as he pleased and opposed Edelgard. Wait, does that mean my father's going to be home all the time now? On second thought, I think I'm fine right here.



Dorothea: Edelgard became emperor and raised an army, huh? Who knew the kid had it in her? I mean, yeah, of course, I knew she'd be emperor eventually, but... The more I think about it, the more surprised I am. I wonder who's going to win?
Byleth: It's worrisome.
Dorothea: It is. We might have to fight against others from the academy, and that's... I can't think about it.
Byleth: We will not lose. 
Dorothea: Thinking about it makes me scared. We're fighting the Knights of Seiros! Still, I know you'll figure something out.



Petra: The Empire and Brigid were once warring with each other. But now, I have made the decision to be fighting with the Empire. It is a choice of irony, I feel. But I am having no regret. My belief is with you and with Edelgard.



Felix: I've been preparing to take this path. My own path--not my old man's, and not the boar's.



Ashe: I can't bring myself to trust the Church of Seiros. Not after they killed Lonato and my brother. I need to know the truth. Even if it means...turning my weapon on Faerghus. I guess Lonato would be happy to hear me say that, if he were still around.



Sylvain: I've gone and done it now, huh? What would my old man say if he knew I'd sided with the Empire? His Highness must be angry. Dimitri gets super scary when he's like that. I wonder how I'm going to die... Ugh, my knees turn to jelly just thinking about it. No, I can't think that way. I promised to fight alongside you. I'm here until the end. Heh, listen to me. I'm terrified, but I feel so calm.



Mercedes: Surely this is what the goddess willed, isn't it? I feel she would not have wanted the Church of Seiros to become what it has...



Annette: Um, Professor... I'm OK with fighting whoever we need to, but I really don't want to battle my father... Oh, but I know that something is wrong with the church... And more than that, I believe in you, and I trust your word. You lead and I'll follow.



Ingrid: I may return to Galatea territory and try to convince my father to join our cause. It's possible that... No. In my heart, I know that my father won't never listen. Still, I must get him to see reason. That this is the only way to ensure our family's future.



Lorenz: I've decided to ally myself with Lady Edelgard. Father will doubtless understand my reasoning. House Gloucester has always had good intentions in its dealings with the Empire. Of course, this does mean that I will no longer be able to avoid a confrontation with Claude. It is unfortunate. We were classmates, after all.



Raphael: No need to worry about me. I got no complaints as long as my little sis is safe. Sure, I lived on Alliance land, but that doesn't mean I served their lords. I'm sure this is the right path, seeing as you're the one who picked it, Professor!



Ignatz: To think that things would come to this. Even a few months ago, I never could've imagined it. I believe in you, Professor, so I'm steeling myself. I can't promise that I'll be useful in battle, but I'm not running away from the fight.



Lysithea: If the church is behind the current state of things--this society in which only Crests are valued--then I have no need of it. Edelgard is taking the shortest path to change. No matter how drastic her measures, I agree that this is the only way. That said, if Edelgard strays from her noble path, I trust you will set her straight again. Won't you? I am counting on you, Professor.



Marianne: Imagine making half the world your enemy for the sake of realizing your own ideals... Edelgard is so radiant and strong compared to someone like me... What if I have the power to change the world too? Even just a little bit...



Leonie: So, you've turned against the church to ally with the Empire too, huh? I never pressed him for details, but Captain Jeralt was always suspicious of Lady Rhea, wasn't he? I'm on your side, no matter what. I promised him I'd support you, and that's what I plan to do.

Ladislava: I believe this is the first time we have met. My name is Ladislava. I have the great honor of leading Lady Edelgard's personal guard. Her majesty is hard on others as she is on herself. She may seem composed, but that is only because she conceals her more passionate emotions. For that reason, she is often misunderstood. But now she has you by her side... I find that most reassuring. I look forward to working with you.



Randolph: I'm Randolph von Bergliez. I'm not very high in the ranks yet, but I'm more or less a general. Just like Caspar, I am from House Bergliez. My mother married into House Bergliez after I was born, so my position within the family is rather lowly... But I'm determined to make something of myself in this battle to bring glory to my part of the family, for the sake of my mother and sister!

@Intro 
Edelgard: We will soon arrive at Garreg Mach Monastery. Forcing a surrender here is extremely significant, both strategically and symbolically. Of course, this is personal as well. This is where we all came together to learn and grow. I have no intention of yielding to our former classmates, so I ask that you prepare yourselves for anything.
Linhardt: I'm not thinking about friends right now, and I'm certainly not prepared.
Caspar: Damn it, don't go around saying things that lower morale before we even get started! I'm ready! Let's go! Let's fight!
Dorothea: I have nothing to lose aside from my friends who are here with me. Does that answer satisfy you?
Petra: I have been ready for this since leaving my land of home. I will fight and win!
Bernadetta: How can you prepare to fight? Maybe I can prepare to prepare...
Ferdinand: There is no reason I cannot be prepared. It is my duty to stand up and battle!
Edelgard: Thank you all. Now, let's talk strategy.
Hubert: As the raiding force, we will attack the area nearest to the monastery. The Knights of Seiros certainly won't stand down after they catch sight of Her Majesty and the professor. At the same time, the remaining areas will be surrounded and annihilated by the main army. In other words, we are the decoy that must suppress the enemy's most elite soldiers.
Edelgard: We know more about the area near the monastery than anyone else in the Imperial army. Still, we must prepare for the worst. It's possible we will have to face the archbishop's true form--the Immaculate One. Fight with all you have, but don't be reckless. As promised, I will leave the command to the professor.
Byleth: We will not lose.
Hubert: Naturally. With both Her Majesty and yourself on our side, defeat is impossible.
Byleth: I will protect you all.
Hubert: Not only will we all survive this, but we will undoubtedly emerge victorious.
Edelgard: This will be our first battle as the Black Eagle Strike Force. All the more reason to prevail!

@Opening 
Emperor Edelgard has declared war on the Church of Seiros and the Crest-dominated world it has created. Her first move is to topple the most prominent symbol of the church's dominance: Garreg Mach.

@Battle 
Seteth: Friends! Our opportunity for victory will come, but first we must see to our defenses!
Hubert: The city's defenders are trying to stall for time. We must crush them swiftly. We should be wary of ambushes as well.
Edelgard: Ladislava is being pushed on the left flank. We must push back with equal force.


Ladislava: Just what we need! I knew Her Majesty's allies would help us out.

Ladislava: Apologies for the trouble, Your Majesty!

Death Knight: We will lend the Empire strength...
Byleth: ?!
Edelgard: Don't worry. We're allies now... I understand you must have many questions, but they'll have to wait until after the battle.

Rhea: Seteth, Flayn, Gilbert... You put your lives on the line to protect us. I would have preferred to have more time to prepare, but we cannot delay any longer. Come forth! Protect Garreg Mach Monastery from these despicable rebels!

Catherine: I'll crush them all.

Cyril: Her enemies are my enemies.

@Boss 
Flayn: You shall not pass! I will protect Garreg Mach!

Flayn: Must protect...Garreg Mach... I must protect...everyone...
Seteth: Retreat while you still can, Flayn! I beg you! 
Flayn: Understood... Stay safe Fa--Brother! 

Gilbert: Unfortunately, you must die here. You should never have defied the goddess.

Gilbert: In my master's name, I cannot allow myself to fall here... I must withdraw.
Seteth: You will survive this hardship! Just hold on! 

Seteth: I will show no mercy to anyone who attacks Rhea!

Seteth: I cannot yield...
Flayn: Seteth! Please, do not overextend yourself! I am still in this fight! 
Seteth: I'm sorry, Flayn... Withdraw if you must... 

%Byleth,Flayn
Flayn: Professor, why?! Do you not see the cruelty of this?

%Byleth,Gilbert
Gilbert: If you side with the Empire... If you turn your sword on the church and the Kingdom... I care not who you are. I will end you just the same.

%Annette,Gilbert
Gilbert: Annette, throw down your arms!
Annette: I'm sorry, Father. But I have made my choice. I'm not going back to the monastery, to the Kingdom, or to you, Father!
Gilbert: Forgive me, Goddess. Annette. If you side with the Empire, I will have no choice but to kill you.

%Byleth,Seteth
Seteth: Traitor! I will not forgive you for turning on Rhea!

@Boss 
Catherine: I am Thunder Catherine, and I will slay all of Lady Rhea's enemies. Including you.

Catherine: Lady Rhea, I'm sorry. Please stay safe.
Rhea: All is well, Catherine. You must not die here.

Cyril: I gotta kill you!

Cyril: Lady Rhea, I couldn't fight hard enough. I'm sorry...
Rhea: Cyril... Your sacrifice will not be in vain.

Rhea: So you have sullied yourself by joining with the rebels? I hope you came prepared to breathe your last.

Rhea: Raaaargh!

%Byleth,Catherine
Catherine: I trusted you. Lady Rhea trusted you. I won't let you live after what you've done.

%Byleth,Cyril
Cyril: I'll protect Lady Rhea against anyone! Even if it's you, I'll fight ya as hard as I can!

%Byleth,Rhea
Rhea: You... How dare you betray me... You worthless piece of garbage... I will punish you myself!

%Edelgard,Rhea
Rhea: No matter your reasons, I cannot permit you to go on living any longer!
Edelgard: The feeling is mutual. I must put a stop to your reign of tyranny!
Rhea: You must know what a fool you are! The greatest of sins is to make an enemy of the goddess herself!
Edelgard: I have only made an enemy of the church, not of the faith.

@End 
The Immaculate One: You will not be forgiven!
Edelgard: Professor, look out!

Imperial Soldier: The castle is crumbling! We must escape!

Hubert: Professor, take cover!
Edelgard: Professor!

@Narration 
In Imperial Year 1181, the new Adrestian emperor, Edelgard von Hresvelg, led a strategic assault against the monastery at Garreg Mach. Though her own losses were great, her foes had no choice but to surrender. Archbishop Rhea commanded the Knights of Seiros, leading from the front lines against the Imperial army. After a hard fought battle, she was forced to retreat to Fhirdiad, the capital of Faerghus, where she must now plan her next move. With this single attack, the Adrestian Empire officially launched its offensive against the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus and the Leicester Alliance. The unification of FÃ³dlan has begun.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
With the capture of Arianrhod complete, the Imperial army moves to invade the Kingdom capital. They plot to send troops toward now vulnerable Fraldarius territory and plan to attack Fhirdiad from two sides.

@Dialogue 
Dimitri: So... Arianrhod has fallen. Rodrigue... I swear that I will not allow your death to be in vain...
Dimitri: So... Arianrhod has fallen. Rodrigue, Felix, Ingrid... I swear that I will not allow your deaths to be in vain...
Rhea: The scouts have just now returned. It seems the Imperial army is marching toward the Kingdom capital. Are you certain about this, Dimitri? As king, do you think it wise to intercept them yourself?
Dimitri: No need to worry yourself. Even if I am defeated, the Blaiddyd bloodline will live on. And the Kingdom's territory has never been rich in resources. If the castle falls under siege, our loss is inevitable. I will deploy my army onto the plains and wait for the enemy. Please position your forces so that they can flank the Imperial army.
Rhea: Yes, given the present situation, making the plains our battlefield is a logical choice. I have no objection. However...
Dimitri: There is only one person I am after. I have no interest in any other prey.
Rhea: I will take you at your word. Erasing the other child's existence is my task, and mine alone. I will get you back, Mother... I promise...




Hubert: What do you think, Lady Edelgard? Will they shut themselves inside of Fhirdiad?
Edelgard: They will try to intercept us. Of course, Fhirdiad will not fall so easily. Even so... If were to cut off their supply with a large army, it would eventually fall. It makes much more sense for them to wager everything on a victory at the Tailtean Plains.
Byleth: The Tailtean Plains...
Edelgard: The same plains where the so-called divine Seiros defeated Nemesis, the King of Liberation, in a comeback victory over 1,000 years ago. And about 400 years ago, the hero Loog created the Kingdom by defeating the emperor of the time on those very plains. Their goal must be to recreate that scene.
Hubert: Yes, I suppose so. Although the Imperial army is powerful, if we were to compare the strength of our best to the best of the Knights of Seiros, we would likely come up short. The Kingdom's army and House Blaiddyd are also renowned for their unmatched persistence. On the battlefield, it can be assumed that their one and only goal will be to strike you down.
Edelgard: Are you telling me to stay off the battlefield?
Hubert: Naturally. You are their aim, Your Majesty. You must know it only makes sense to keep you out of their reach.
Edelgard: And you must know that, at a time like this, I absolutely cannot withdraw.
Hubert: Of course I know that. That is why I will refrain from asking you again to stay away from the battlefield.
Edelgard: The Immaculate One, descendants of the 10 Elites, and other extremely fearsome foes await us. But with the help of our friends, we have a chance of defeating them. We're the only ones who can. Within our group, I am included among those with the king of strength we need to win. I absolutely will not remove myself from the front lines. Professor you have that same strength as well, whether or not you realize it yet.
Byleth: Of course.
Edelgard: As emperor, I must not die in this war, and it would be unacceptable to lose you as well.
Byleth: I will protect you. 
Edelgard: Please, don't get yourself killed trying to protect me.
Edelgard: Until the very end, we'll survive this trial together. Understood?

@Conversation 
Edelgard: This month, we will take all of the military force we can muster and advance to the Kingdom capital of Fhirdiad. I have no intention of retreating to Garreg Mach after we've come this far. We will only return after we've conquered Fhirdiad and put an end to this war. Be sure to steel your heart and ready yourself for the battle ahead.
Byleth: I'm ready for anything.
Edelgard: Are you certain? If so, please help me raise the morale of our allies.
Byleth: I'll do what I can. 
Edelgard: I'm sorry to burden you, but please look after our allies as well.
Byleth: I'm not sure I'll be ready in time...
Edelgard: We have no choice. I have every faith that you are capable of this.



Hubert: Tch. Lord Arundel. As long as he exists, Lady Edelgard will...
Byleth: Just who is that man?
Hubert: I believe I have explained before that he is the one who commanded the likes of Solon and Kronya. Cornelia, whom we defeated Arianrhod, was also one of his. An irksome sort. We must not fail to be rid of him. He is a maggot, crawling in the filth of the world, feeding off the Empire like a parasite.



Ferdinand: Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital... From the Empire's perspective, it seems like the northernmost edge of the world. I have come a long way, following you and Edelgard. To think, what if I had succeeded Duke Aegir as prime minister? I would never have had all these experiences.
Byleth: You've really grown up. 
Ferdinand: I hope that is true. I used to be so naive...
Byleth: You'll always be a noble, through and through.
Ferdinand: Please do not tease, Professor. I think all of this has changed me a little bit.
Ferdinand: For now, let us join together and walk the path that Her Majesty lays out.



Linhardt: When you think of it, as one approaches the end of a war, the sacrifices only grow larger, don't they? The winning side musters their forces and attempts to strike a decisive blow... While those of the losing side make desperate attempts to turn the war in their favor. Neither side will give. I only wish we'd consider those who lose their lives in that struggle.
Byleth: We're far from safe ourselves. 
Linhardt: Yes, exactly my point. Let's be careful to ensure we don't lose our own lives, Professor.
Byleth: It's a necessary sacrifice.
Linhardt: Perhaps, but that doesn't make it any easier to accept your own survival depends on a throw of the dice.
Byleth: It's better than dragging the war out.
Linhardt: I can appreciate that, but just because a choice is better does not mean that it's good.



Caspar: All right! Off to the Kingdom's capital we go! Huh. I feel like I've said that before.
Byleth: You're imagining things.
Caspar: My imagination, eh? You usually know what you're talking about. Still, this is gonna bug me...
Byleth: It's not your imagination.
Caspar: Yeah, you usually know what you're talking about. I just can't remember when I woulda said it!
Byleth: Let's head for the Kingdom capital! 
Caspar: All right! I'm fired up and ready to go!



Bernadetta: Professor! What should I do!? Everyone's acting like this is leading up to the final chapter in a book or something! Is the battle ahead really going to be that climatic? Am I not taking it seriously enough?!
Byleth: You're doing just fine. 
Bernadetta: You think so? All right, I believe you. I'm...ready for this. I am. Yeah! We're going to win!
Byleth: You could be showing more resolve.
Bernadetta: I know, I know, but I...don't wanna die!
Byleth: What you really need to do is relax.
Bernadetta: Yeah, you're probably right. I should take a breath and try to calm down.



Dorothea: We're almost to the Kingdom capital of Fhirdiad. Just imagine...the war might almost be over. But is it true that Arianrhod was annihilated?! What in the world happened?! What is the Seiros Church, really?
Byleth: We'll find out if we conquer the Kingdom capital.
Dorothea: Fair enough. Let's just focus on this battle right now.
Byleth: It's impossible to say right now.
Dorothea: Of course, Professor. I trust you, OK?
Byleth: For now, just trust in me. 
Dorothea: I always have, and I always will.



Petra: I have...worries. What have I been achieving? When the war is ended, I will be returning to Brigid with many...much new potential. But have I had enough growth to become the ruler?
Byleth: Yes. You should be proud.
Petra: I have gratitude. I will take your words into my heart.
Byleth: Only you can answer that. 
Petra: This is the truth. I will fight with all of my strength so that I will know with certainty!
Petra: Brigid pride, technique, and culture... I will be showing all of the world who we are!



Felix: They used to call my father the Shield of Faerghus. Now he's gone, and Arianrhod has fallen. Yet the Knights of Seiros remain. As does the boar. What terrifies me most is his stubbornness. He'll keep on fighting to the last man. He's a monster. I've seen it firsthand.



Ashe: I hear that House Blaiddyd commands some strong and well-trained troops. People say they're fiercely devoted and will gladly die for their king. Reminds me of Lonato's men-the ones we faced back in Magdred. Unlike those civilian soldiers though, here we're up against the best that the Faerghus army has to offer. It's going to be a hard battle, but if there's a peaceful tomorrow waiting on the other side, it'll be worth it.



Sylvain: I've been thinking about how we've got our own ideas about justice...and so does the Kingdom. And what's coming, it's not just a battle between us and them. It's our ideals that are fighting. Whoever wins will say they were right and the other side was wrong. That's how it goes... But nobody's willing to talk or compromise, so we'll fight to the death to prove the other guy's wrong. It won't be an easy battle, but let's make sure we come back alive. Right, Professor?



Mercedes: When I first enrolled in the Officers Academy, I never thought it would come to this. I can't believe we're waging war...against the church, no less.
Byleth: Do you regret it?
Mercedes: There are some things that I regret, but I don't think I made the wrong decision.
Byleth: Are you ready to face this? 
Mercedes: Yes, of course.
Mercedes: Even if our enemy is Lady Rhea herself, I am prepared to fight.



Annette: I'm sure my father will be waiting in Fhirdiad. If I can avoid it, I'd rather not fight him... But I don't think my father is capable of betraying the royal family...of betraying Dimitri. I must be prepared to do...what I have to.
Byleth: I'm counting on you. 
Annette: Right!
Byleth: Don't push yourself too hard.
Annette: I'm alright. I still stand by my decision to trust in you.
Annette: Professor... Let's make sure we win!



Ingrid: Claude was known as the Master Tactician. There wasn't a situation he couldn't strategize his way out of. Whereas, King Dimitri is known as the Tempest King. He is a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. We still haven't ever faced him head-on. Can we do this?
Byleth: We can.
Ingrid: Yes. Of course we can! I'm sorry. I let my uncertainty get the better of me.
Byleth: I'll see this through. 
Ingrid: Ah, Professor. Ever the reliable one.
Ingrid: We have you, and we have Edelgard. Not to mention many other allies we can rely upon. Together...we can overcome even the most formidable foe!



Lorenz: Personally I take no issue with attacking Lady Rhea. But the eagerness of my fellow nobles does vex me, despite so many grand displays of piety from them in the past. It gives me the impression that faith is little more than a tool they use to maintain their positions of power.
Byleth: Disappointed in the nobility? 
Lorenz: I suppose I am in no position to judge them, being among their number myself. Still, it irritates me.
Byleth: Is religion obsolete, then?
Lorenz: If it is no longer useful as a tool, then I expect the nobles will cease to give it any credence.
Lorenz: What is a noble's duty, truly? I hope we will discover an answer in the conflict ahead.



Raphael: Hyah! Next up's the Kingdom capital! We're coming for you! Whoa. That sounds familiar. Have I said that before?
Byleth: You're imagining things.
Raphael: Really? You're probably right. It's not like we've invaded the Kingdom capital before.
Byleth: It's not your imagination.
Raphael: Really? Does that mean we've invaded the Kingdom capital before?
Byleth: Let's head for the Kingdom capital! 
Raphael: Yeah! Let's do it, Professor! I just gotta get my muscles prepped and ready first!



Ignatz: Once the Kingdom capital falls, all of FÃ³dlan will be united under the banner of the Empire. Isn't it thrilling? We're going to make history.
Byleth: Only if we win.
Ignatz: Well, yes, I suppose that's true.
Byleth: Unless we lose.
Ignatz: Hah! I don't think that will happen.
Byleth: Let's stay calm and focus on the battle. 
Ignatz: Yes, of course! I'll do my best.
Ignatz: Our opponents may be strong, but with you on our side, we can't lose!



Lysithea: If we win this battle, it will be an end to the Kingdom, and to the church. Under the Empire, an era of peace would begin... Many people are cleaving to this notion, but I wonder if it would really end up as such.
Byleth: It will.
Lysithea: Such resolve. It's convincing, to say the least.
Byleth: It won't.
Lysithea: I worry as much myself.
Byleth: It's hard to say. 
Lysithea: It's trueâit's nothing but hypotheticals at this point.
Lysithea: I wonder... Was the collapse of Arianrhod really the church's doing? Or could it be that... Hm. Never mind me. Just thinking aloud.



Marianne: Dear Goddess...
Byleth: Praying again?
Marianne: Yes. I was praying for your safety.
Byleth: What are you praying for? 
Marianne: Um...for your safety.
Marianne: I'll do all I can to survive, but please...please don't die out there, Professor.



Leonie: Looks like we're finally getting to the end of this thing. Don't go dying on us now, all right?
Byleth: Not a chance. 
Leonie: Ha! I like your confidence.
Byleth: Same to you.
Leonie: Not planning on it.
Leonie: If you're still alive when this is all over, then I'll have kept my word to Captain Jeralt. Let's both live to see the dawn of a bright new age!



Alois: I wonder would the captain would say if he knew we were planning to take down Lady Rhea. Lady Rhea and Captain Jeralt went back pretty far. But hey, it's your decision! I'm sure he would have understood in the end. Now, onward to Fhirdiad! I'm ready!



Shamir: The idea of defeating Rhea is beginning to feel more like a reality. Some may say that I'm returning her goodwill with betrayal, but I believe I've worked off my debt. The real problem is a certain someone else.
Byleth: Catherine? 
Shamir: That's right. She was my partner, after all. I haven't seen her since leaving the knights...
Byleth: Cyril?
Shamir: I taught him some archery, but we are of different birth and hold different values. I was speaking of Catherine.
Byleth: Gilbert?
Shamir: I have no particular interest in him. I was speaking of Catherine.
Shamir: I can see her coming to slaughter me. Driven by her mixed emotions of love and hate.



Hanneman: When Edelgard first invited me to join this army, I, to be frank, thought her dream utterly ridiculous. But at my advanced age, I was tempted by the notion of chasing a seemingly impossible dream through blood, sweat, and tears. Five years on, the unification of FÃ³dlan is slowly becoming a reality. Now I feel... It may soon be possible to abolish the nobility, and create a world where none need suffer due to crests.
Byleth: ...
Hanneman: You need not say anything. I will stay by your side, and hers, to the very end.



Manuela: Professor, do you mind if I complain about something, well, personal? Of course you don't. This army is almost all single men. If that marital status came before or during the war, I'm not to say... The point is, I'm in charge of the infirmary. I wind up treating hundreds of men every week. I get to talk to all sorts of men, from all walks of life, all of the time. And yet...
Byleth: You don't have a boyfriend?
Manuela: No! Not one of those men is infatuated with their caregiver! Isn't that supposed to happen in wartime?!
Byleth: You aren't married yet? 
Manuela: Forget that, I can't even find a boyfriend! Marriage is justâpffftt! A joke! Just a sick joke.
Byleth: Maybe you should give up on love.
Manuela: Yeah... I'm starting to figure that's the most realistic option.
Manuela: At this point, I'm just hoping you stay single too. Then at least we can share each other's misery!



Jeritza: The war is at its end. Has the time finally come that I might kill you?
Byleth: The battle will continue even beyond the war.
Jeritza: It is true... Those petulant fleas must be picked off one by one. There are nothing if not persistent.
Byleth: There's no guarantee that we'll win next time.
Jeritza: And if we do not win, then we die. Either has its charms.



Anna: Seems like the war is gonna end soon. Once the dust settles, it'll be back to rolling in fat stacks of gold for me!



Fleche: Ah! Did you want something?! Sorry, I was a bit lost in thought... Or rather, I was thinking about work. My brother had sorted out all his personal affairs, but apparently he'd forgotten about his work duties. So now I've got a ton more work on my plate... Oh, Brother, why must you be so careless... Once this war is over, I'm gonna take a vacation and get some well-earned rest back home with my mother.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! The time has finally come to set out for the Kingdom Capital, Fhirdiad. I thought the same thing last month, but I still can't believe the plan was to ambush Arianrhod. I know it couldn't helped, but even I wasn't let in on the secret. Me! Not gonna lie...that hurt a little. Ah well, let's forget about that! I'm praying for your victory and your safe return!

@Dialogue
Jeralt: Sorry... It looks like...I'm going to have to leave you now. (groans) One day, I hope you'll give this ring to someone you love as well as I love her.
Byleth: (Someone I love...)

@Opening 
With Arianrhod now behind them, the Black Eagle Strike Force marches north to Fhirdiad. They plan for the Imperial army stationed in former Alliance territory to take over Fraldarius Land so they are able to attack Fhirdiad from two directions. King Dimitri anticipates the Imperial army's strategy, leading the Kingdom army and Rhea's Knights of Seiros out of Fhirdiad, and prepares to intercept the Imperial army at the Tailtean Plains.

@Intro 
Seiros: Mother... Oddly the rain has come to fall yet again. At this place, once again... I will fight to take you back... The one who keeps me from seeing you again... I will be sure to return them to the earth from whence they came. The foolish descendant of Hresvelg who bares her fangs at me will suffer the same fate...
Church Soldier: Lady Rhea...
Seiros: Call me Seiros now. I am no longer the archbishop, but rather a warrior.
Church Soldier: Yes, Lady Seiros. Because of the rain, we have not yet confirmed the position of our enemy or of the Kingdom army...
Seiros: Search the route to Fhirdiad. It is unlikely that they have strayed far from it. When you discover the Imperial army's main force, commence the attack. If the Kingdom's army has already engaged, flank the enemy as planned.
Church Soldier: As you wish.

Seiros: Wait for me, dear child... I will be paying you a visit soon... When this sword has been plunged into your chest... Yes, that is the very moment I have long for...

Dimitri: I was hoping they would strike the church first... We must have miscalculated the rate of their advance. Reorganize the formation. We have no choice but to buy time until the church arrives. It will be a long battle... Are you afraid, Dedue?
Dedue: No. So long as I am at your side, there is nothing to fear.
Dimitri: I can always rely on you. Just watch, my friend... We will prevail. I will not fail to get revenge for all who have fallen.
Dedue: I would follow you anywhere, Your Majesty. Good luck out there.
Dimitri: You as well, Dedue. You as well.
Dedue: Your Majesty... For you, I will...

Edelgard: A flag of blue is flapping in the rain... It must be the Kingdom army.
Hubert: Yes. It seems that King Dimitri is leading the troops himself. However, the Knights of Seiros have yet to be seen. Perhaps they have split up.
Edelgard: I can't imagine that Dimitri would leave the capital to the church and face us with the Kingdom army alone. He must be planning to use the church to gain the upper hand in battle. With the rain, that must be difficult to coordinate... Still, the Knights of Seiros must be around here somewhere.
Hubert: Then we should be on alert for attacks from the side and rear as well. Inform the entire army.
Imperial Soldier: Yes, sir!

Hubert: Now that I think about it, the Kingdom's Army is quite different than it once was. They have taken a position of interception. In the past, the king would have introduced himself before beginning a fair fight.
Edelgard: A fair fight... The words alone remind me of how he once was. Don't you agree, Professor?
Byleth: Who might that be?
Edelgard: Oh, have you forgotten already? Dimitri often spoke of such things back at the monastery.
Byleth: Dimitri?
Edelgard: Yes. He often spoke of such things back at the monastery.
Byleth: Claude? 
Edelgard: Of all the people in the world, why would talk of a fair fight remind you of Claude? I'm talking about Dimitri. Have you forgotten? He often spoke of such things back at the monastery.
Hubert: Well, at the present, the words fair fight do not seem to suit Dimitri anymore. He dislikes making victims of his friends, but other than that, he will do most anything these days... If he stops at nothing to continue the onslaught, I cannot imagine what will become of the battlefield.
Edelgard: True. As soon as we can take our battle formation, we must advance. Dimitri, that past you cling to... I will soon free you from it.

@Opening 
The Black Eagle Strike Force, in its continued pursuit of FÃ³dlan's unification, marches on Fhirdiad. Kingdom and church forces prepare to meet you at Tailtean Plains, a place laden with history.

@Battle
Dimitri: Ah, here you are, Edelgard...at your eternal resting place. You have trampled and stolen and blinded yourself to the truth. Today, I will have vengeance for all you have done!
Edelgard: With this battle, the main force of the Kingdom will be annihilated! Leave no enemy general alive. Least of all King Dimitri!

Hubert: We are uncertain of the enemy's plans, so let us advance our troops with caution. The Knights of Seiros have yet to show themselves. They will join the battle at some point. Be ready.

Kingdom General: We're first in line! Charge! 
Sylvain: Don't let this chance for vengeance go to waste! 
Sylvain: Time to join the front lines. We should all show a little loyalty from time to time, yeah? 
Kingdom Soldier: Glory to the flag of the knights! Good fortune to His Majesty! Fortune...to Faerghus... Graaaaargh!

Hubert: What theâ That Kingdom soldier just changed into a Demonic Beast. Did Thales... No. This is something simpler.
Dimitri: This is the work of a Crest Stone... But why...
Dedue: I gave them Crest Stones from the castle vaults.
Dimitri: You fool! Why did you do that?
Dedue: If we lose here, the Kingdom falls. It's our only hope.
Dimitri: You call this hope?! Well, we must now claim victory so their deaths were not in vain.
Dedue: Yes, Your Majesty. I am with you.

Kingdom General: Gautier reinforcements have arrived! We shall crush the Empire weaklings! 
Mercedes: Don't worry everyone! The reinforcements have arrived! 
Edelgard: Reinforcements... We're in danger. We must defeat the enemy's generals before we're overwhelmed.

Hubert: This battle may turn against us if we allow any more of them to transform. We don't know which soldiers have Crest Stones. We must do away with all of them, and quickly!

Rhea: How could I be late, when I finally have the opportunity to destroy the fallen one? This rain...it is the lamentation of my mother... Observe. I shall not fail in restoring balance.

@Boss 
Sylvain: So what are you waiting for? Let's finish this today.

%Byleth,Sylvain
#avatar-M
Sylvain: Professor! Has it really been five years? We ought to raise a glass for the occasion. Celebrate your return. Nah, I'd rather commemorate it with your death.

#avatar-F
Sylvain: Professor, there's something I should admit. I've got some regrets about how our lives have gone. I should have made a proper attempt to woo you before now. Instead, I have to kill you.

@Boss 
%Ingrid,Sylvain
Sylvain: Stand down, Ingrid. I know you don't want to die here.
Ingrid: I will not. I'll never ally myself with the likes of you.
Sylvain: Stubborn as ever. I always did like that about you.
Ingrid: And you never cease to amaze me with your false flattery. Don't waste your breath.

@Boss
Sylvain: I was such a fool. So...this is how it ends. Forgive me, Your Majesty. I'm...going on...ahead.
Dimitri: Thank you, Sylvain. Until we meet again on the other side... 

Mercedes: It makes me so sad to fight against you, but I suppose that's how things go when you're at war. Why follow an emperor who would start such a war?

%Byleth,Mercedes
Mercedes: I'm sorry, Professor. I can't join you... There are important things I must stay and protect.

%Annette,Mercedes
Annette: Mercie...
Mercedes: Now now, Annie. There's no need for that. This is a battlefield, after all.
Annette: I'm so sorry... You know that, don't you? And also know that you don't have to forgive me...
Mercedes: I was going to say the same thing. I'm so sorry if I cause you any pain.

%Jeritza,Mercedes
Jeritza: Step back, Mercedes.
Mercedes: I won't. This is the path I have chosen. It's the same for you too, Emile. Is it not? Someday, we may meet again in another life. Whenever that happens, I hope that we'll remain side by side, always...
Jeritza: My dear sister... I am sorry.

@Boss
Mercedes: I'm...I'm sorry, Dimitri... I can't seem to stay...on my feet.
Dimitri: Forgive me, Mercedes. Were it not for me, you wouldn't have gotten caught up in all this, and you might still be alive... 

Dedue: You will never understand the burden His Majesty carries on his shoulders!

%Byleth,Dedue
Dedue: It is a shame. I really believed you would come to believe His Majesty's perspective.

@Boss
Dedue: It is time. Your Majesty... I will avenge your father. You are the one true king...Dimitri. Grr... Grrrr!
Dimitri: Dedue! I will fight by your side until the bitter end... As long as I am with you, this lance of mine will know nothing of defeat!

Dedue: Your Majesty...you must survive...
Dimitri: Dedue... You fought well, my friend. 

Dedue: Urghh...
Dimitri: Dedue... You fool...

Dimitri: You will not kill one more soul. You will not steal one more thing. I will not allow it. Here and now, I stand against you!

%Byleth,Dimitri
Dimitri: Why did you choose Edelgard, Professor? Why did you choose to walk this savage, bloody path? I cannot shake this feeling of regret... Regret that I must kill you now.

%Edelgard,Dimitri
Dimitri: Must you continue to conquer? Continue to kill?
Edelgard: Must you continue to reconquer? Continue to kill in retaliation? I will not stop. There is nothing I would not sacrifice to cut a path to FÃ³dlan's new dawn!
Dimitri: Enough of this madness! This future of yours is built on a foundation of corpses and tears!

@Boss
Dimitri: Not only have you become the emperor's lap dog, but you have turned against your own people. From the depths of hell, you will regret tainting the land of Faerghus! 

%Felix,Dimitri
Dimitri: You killed Rodrigue... your own father, Felix.
Felix: I said I'd cut down anyone who stood in my way. Even my father. Even my friends.
Dimitri: I see. That was all I needed to hear to finally work up the resolve to kill you.

@Boss
Dimitri: No! Not yet... I can't die just yet...
Sylvain: Dimitri, you idiot! Retreat! Wait, your injury... No! 
Dedue: Fall back, Your Majesty! We cannot lose you! 
Seiros: King Dimitri! There is no retreat for the Knights of Seiros! Fight until none are left standing! Slaughter them all and send them straight to hell!  No... It can't be... There is no retreat for the Knights of Seiros! Fight until none are left standing! Slaughter them all and send them straight to hell! 

Seiros: You are all damned, with no hope of salvation. For the sin of insurgency, you shall be consigned to hell!

%Byleth,Seiros
Seiros: I once walked this world as Seiros, the warrior... and defeated the Fell King Nemesis. Now, here I stand, facing one who wields the same sword as he... The fate you have chosen is also the same as his... To die in torment upon my sword, as the very lifeblood you have forsaken spills onto the earth!

%Edelgard,Seiros
Seiros: An ancestor of the Hresvelgs, who became Adrestia's first emperor... He saved me. Supported me. Gave his all to the cause of defeating Nemesis. That I should find myself here at Tailtean, striking down his scion...
Edelgard: I don't advise presumptions, Rhea. I will not die by your hand.

@End
Seiros: How can this be? I lost to that thief?! Unacceptable!
Knight of Seiros: Watch out, Lady Rhea! Please retreat!
Seiros: Gyhh!

Dimitri: The Church of Seiros has fallen back, but we have no such luxury. Everyone, fight for your lives! Victory to Faerghus! 

Dimitri: Edelgard! You... I will kill you! You will know the regret of my father, who was killed for you! Of my stepmother, who was slain by her own daughter! You will bow your head before all the lives you trampled for your ideals before you die in misery!
Edelgard: Your obsession with me is appalling. If you were a normal human, you would most certainly have died already. Farewell, King of Delusion. If only we were born in a time of peace, you might have lived a joyful life as a benevolent ruler.
Dimitri: To the fires of eternity with you...El...

Dedue: Your Majesty... Your Majesty!
Dimitri: Stop calling me that.
Dedue: Ah, thank the... No...
Dimitri: Dedue... It seems I will die...before I can get revenge for everyone...
Dedue: ...
Dimitri: My family, my friends, my home... Everything that truly mattered to me... I couldn't...
Dedue: You're wrong! Because of you, I was able to live on until today. You saved me. These past nine years... I am proud to have been at your side. It was a joy I never could have hoped for. Despite all, I count myself a lucky man.
Dimitri: Is that so? I see... I am glad...
Dedue: You must be weary, Your Majesty. Please...rest in peace.

Church Soldier: Lady Rhea! King Dimitri has fallen in battle! The Kingdom's army has retreated! It is impossible to preserve the front line! 
Seiros: Gah... Everyone withdraw immediately! Fall back to Fhirdiad! The goddess is watching over us! If we hold strong we will surely be saved!
Church Soldier: Understood! Retreat!

Seiros: Why do you insist on being such a loathsome obstacle... You stole my mother's heart and wield the Sword of the Creator. Just like that savage King Nemesis... I swear...with these very hands... I will take her back... Until then, wait for me, dear Mother...

Edelgard: Rhea... She is our enemy, but I must admit that she plays her cards magnificently.
Hubert: You mean using the goddess's name in order to boost morale?
Edelgard: That's true, but she also shows great skill in devising her tactics. Using the bewildered Kingdom army as a shield while she and the knights retreated... If they ran all the way back to Fhirdiad, it will be very difficult to pursue them.
Byleth: Can we defeat them?
Edelgard: If you're low on confidence, Professor, I'll put an end to this myself. Actually...that's what I'd like to say, but in truth I hope to confront them with you at my side.
Byleth: Next time, we will end this.
Edelgard: Yes. Together, we'll end this once and for all.
Edelgard: For all of the lives lost in battle, by our allies and foes alike... And for Dimitri, as well...
Byleth: For Dimitri?
Edelgard: Yes. The thirst for revenge that imprisoned him was the result of my uncle's strategy. He believed that I was the cause of everything...and he lost sight of his path as king. There was nothing I could do to save him. And so, the very least I could do was--
Byleth: Are you crying?
Edelgard: No. The Edelgard who shed tears died many years ago. Everything that's happened...it's all just part of the ebb and flow of history. The Tragedy of Duscur, our days at the academy, Father's death, and the five years you were gone... After all of that, at long last, we're here at this point in time. I hope you'll stay by my side until the very end. It's time for humanity to take this world back.

@Opening 
Arianrhod, the Fortress City, lies on what was once the border between the Kingdom and the Empire and is a valuable strategic asset. Dimitri intends to reclaim it.

@Intro 
Dimitri: Thank you. you may leave now.
Byleth: Did something happen?
Byleth: Was the report worrying?
Dimitri: Not really... There is just a problem I must now clean up. Do you know of Arianrhod? It is a fortress that also goes by the name of the Silver Maiden.
Byleth: I've heard of it.
Dimitri: Yes, I had thought I might have mentioned it before. It is a fortress city that is lauded as the strongest in the Kingdom.
Byleth: This is the first I'm hearing of it.
Dimitri: Is that so? Arianrhod is a fortress city, lauded as the strongest in the Kingdom.
Dimitri: The land around Arianrhod was once entrusted to Count Rowe... When he turned to the Empire, the Silver Maiden went with him. Now, one after another the lords of each region are leaving the Empire at the call of the eastern lords... But I am sure the Empire has no plans to relinquish the Fortress City, given its strategic position on the front lines of their war with the Kingdom. Unless we can take back Arianrhod, the Kingdom will continually be attacked at its weakest points. I was thinking that we need to deal with it soon, and that we need to investigate the status of the enemy's force, but...
Byleth: Is there a problem?
Dimitri: I am afraid so. We confirmed that troops departed the Imperial capital, headed for Arianrhod. If they are followed by a second and third batch of reinforcements, then the difficulty of taking back Arianrhod will increase exponentially. But, that does not mean we are entirely without recourse. I am just at a loss as to when the soldiers will arrive.
Byleth: Let's go. 
Dimitri: Right away? You never cease to amaze. Your answers always bring me joy. OK. Let's gather everyone immediately. We'll begin the war council for the departing troops.
Byleth: Not yet. 
Dimitri: Indeed, I realized that was out of the blue. You have your own worries. Please accept my apologies. Though I do hope to deal with this sooner than later... If possible, I would like to ask you to take the lead. Speak with me again if you change your mind.

@Battle 
Hubert: It seems we are just in time. Any later, and Arianrhod may have been lost. Her Majesty was right to send me here.
Dimitri: Hubert. So, you have come here in command of extra troops from the Imperial capital... I had hoped to take the fort while it was poorly defended, but now... Well, there is nothing to be done. We must defeat him and then take Arianrhod.

Dimitri: If I remember correctly, there should be devices somewhere that let you deactivate the traps. However... Arianrhod has been in Imperial hands for a while now. They may have changed how things work. But there's no point in dawdling. Let's just make a point to disable any devices we come across.

Hanneman: So what if they disable some old contraptions? It's no loss to us. The city's defenses are under my exclusive control. 
Imperial General: No luck, buddy. All the city's defenses are under my control! 
Dimitri: So, the system has been modified. The person operating the traps must be elsewhere...

Dimitri: Surprise reinforcements... We must defeat them.

Dimitri: That should take care of the traps.

Dimitri: Good. We've cut them off from their reinforcements.

Hubert: I suppose you thought defeating the troops outside the castle first would demoralize the ones within. Not such a bad idea, honestly. But you failed to account for me. 

@Boss 
Hanneman: For the sake of Edelgard, I shall take the liberty of helping.

%Byleth,Hanneman
Hanneman: In the end, I may not have gleaned your secret. Yet, even if I die, someone will follow my work, and another after that. Such is the way of scholarship.

@Boss
Hanneman: If I die for this new Empire...then I have no...regrets.
Dimitri: Professor Hanneman... That should take care of the traps.

Manuela: I'd hate to kill someone I know...but I have no choice.

%Byleth,Manuela
Manuela: Oh dear, Professor. Fate can be so cruel. Spilling the blood of your students with your own hands... How can you carry on after that?

%Dimitri,Manuela
Manuela: You've grown into a fine, handsome man, Dimitri. Bit of a shame you've also become a violent beast. Men like you make the Silver Maiden cry.
Dimitri: Oh? I suppose it is a shame, Professor Manuela. Perhaps I should have appeared before you holding a bouquet of flowers, rather than the weapon that will end your life.

@Boss
Manuela: So, the Silver Maiden...will be my last stage? Heh... You know, that's...that's not too bad.
Dimitri: Professor Manuela... At least we have stopped the reinforcements.

Hubert: Arianrhod is a crucial asset to the Empire. You will not pry it from our grasp.

Hubert: That's as far as I go... I'll withdraw... for now.

%Byleth,Hubert
Hubert: First Gronder Field, and now here. You certainly have a talent for getting in our way.

@End 
Dimitri: The Empire troops are withdrawing... This is it. We failed to get Hubert, but at least we recaptured Arianrhod. Let's clean up the wreckage and return to Garreg Mach. Well done, everyone! The day is ours!

Dimitri: Oh... It's you.
Byleth: Are you tired?
Byleth: A rare sight...
Dimitri: I think all of this work is just catching up with me. Just pretend that yawn never happened. By the way, I wanted to thank you for your help with the Arianrhod campaign the other day. You were exceptional. Your leadership was key in taking back Arianrhod safely.
Byleth: We all contributed.
Dimitri: Indeed, everyone gave their all for victory. I am always being saved by those around me, it seems.
Byleth: We got lucky.
Dimitri: Do not be so modest.
Dimitri: It seems that after taking back Arianrhod, many things are changing within the Kingdom. Specifically, the lesser lords of the land surrounding Arianrhod have pledged vassalage to the Kingdom. The knights they possess may now be added to the Kingdom's army. And if that happens, I would like to leave them in your capable hands. Also... Ah, my apologies. Here I am, simply throwing one report after another at you.
Byleth: Aren't you overdoing it?
Dimitri: Perhaps. It is certainly true that I have been stuck in my quarters lately, dealing with more official business and other such tasks than ever before. But that is something I have been putting off for far too long. Though it is exhausting, filling in the blanks of five years and several months must be done. I am going to tackle them all, one at a time. That is one small part of my atonement. So, Professor... I have been doing all of the talking, but I assume you came here for a reason.
Byleth: I thought we could all celebrate our victory.
Dimitri: A victory celebration, you say?
Byleth: I intend to steal you away to the victory celebration.
Dimitri: Steal me away? That seems rather unnecessary... Hmm... A victory celebration, you say?
Dimitri: You know, this reminds me of that time I dragged you to the dining hall. Do you recall?
Byleth: I do.
Byleth: When was that?
Dimitri: If memory serves, that was after the mock battle between the houses... It was a wonderful time. We had just finished our mission, and we were invited to join in the celebration... You know, every once in a while, I do long to be part of the group as well. But do you think that it is really acceptable? For someone like me to quietly join in the merriment?
Byleth: Everyone's waiting for you.
Byleth: You're thinking about it too much.
Dimitri: You really think so? Well, if you insist... Thank you, Professor. Now then, let's go. Together.

@Opening 
The Alliance has requested aid from the monastery, but the Knights of Seiros are low on personnel. Alois and Shamir decide that the students will have to suffice...

@Intro 
Shamir: ...And that is our situation.
Alois: But with so few knights, we'll surely--

Alois: Ah, Professor! Excellent timing.
Byleth: What's going on?
Shamir: Alois. You're not going to suggest we send students, are you?
Alois: I am, actually. Do you have a problem with that?
Shamir: I do. We can't send them out on a knight's mission without Rhea's blessing.
Alois: I'm sure I can get the go-ahead. I'll just say the students have a...new field training opportunity, or something like that. Besides, we'll be there. We're not going to let them get killed by pirates.
Byleth: What's this about pirates?
Byleth: What are you talking about?
Shamir: There are pirates causing havoc in the port of Derdriu, at the center of House Riegan's territory.
Alois: The Merchants' Association sent a request via the Eastern Church, asking for protection.
Byleth: The Eastern Church?
Shamir: You haven't heard of the Eastern Church? I suppose that's because they don't have much of a presence.
Alois: The Eastern Church controls eastern FÃ³dlan. They don't have a standing army like we do. So, for incidents like this, they customarily ask for help from the Central Church.
Shamir: I imagine they want to contribute to make their presence known in the Alliance.
Alois: Be that as it may, we knights are quite busy. We don't have personnel to spare. Therefore, we're enlisting your help!
Shamir: You should have some experience dealing with pirates from your mercenary days, right?
Byleth: I may.
Byleth: I don't remember.
Shamir: The students have dealt with pirates, so this shouldn't be a problem for them.
Alois: Come with us, won't you? Think of it as a training exercise. The Merchants' Association will reward us handsomely!
Byleth: Let's go. 
Shamir: We don't have time to lose. Let's take care of this quickly.
Byleth: I don't know if I should. 
Alois: We're not leaving right away. Think on it.
Shamir: If you wish to join us, let me know.

@Battle 
Pirate Captain: Tremble before us! We are the great navy of Almyra! Resist and we'll burn this town to the ground!
Alois: The Almyran Navy... This is going to be tougher than I expected.
If Claude is deployed:

Claude: Huh? Sure, those look like Almyran ships, but I guarantee you they're just common pirates.
Shamir: They're obviously bluffing, but it seems to be working on the merchants. Shall we?
Merchant: It's the knights! Please, save us! We'll reward you handsomely!
Merchant: It would be a disaster if they attacked our shops. Please, don't let them into town!
Alois: We've got you. Leave it to the Knights of Seiros!

Pirate: Hahaha! Smash up the houses and trash the shops! Swipe anything that's not nailed down!
Merchant: Aah! If they attack the town, we won't even be able to pay the knights their reward...
Alois: That's not good. The pirates have got into town. We have to beat them, quick.

Shamir: The town is under attack. We have to move quickly.

Merchant: If the town gets damaged any further, we won't have much to offer as a reward...
Alois: Who cares about the reward? We're trying to protect the people!

Pirate: We are the ruthless barbarians of Almyra! Resist and pay the price!
Merchant: Oh dear... My wares! I'll be ruined! Please, do something quickly!

Alois: We are the Knights of Seiros, and we will not tolerate your violent villainy!

@Boss 
%Claude,Pirate Captain
Claude: How could you commit such crimes in the name of Almyra? It's because of two-bit miscreants like you that Almyrans suffer so much hate!
Pirate Captain: Sh-shut up! Say what you will, we're the real navy of Almyra!

%Alois,Pirate Captain
Alois: You're in charge of this sorry band, huh? We'll punish you in the name of the goddess!
Pirate Captain: Quiet, you! Time for a counter attack!

%Shamir,Pirate Captain
Shamir: Hate us all you want. We're just doing our job.
Pirate Captain: Idle prattle! You think you can beat us?

@End 
Claude: Ugh, what a pain that guy was. If you're going to pose as an Almyran, at least fight like one!

Alois: Well, that's over with. They were a lot more trouble than I expected.
Merchant: Thank you so much! Here's your reward. Please, take it.

Alois: Well, we got rid of them, but the town's not looking too pretty.
Merchant: Thank you. It's not much, but please take this as a reward.

Alois: Good gracious, I didn't expect it to become such a large-scale battle.
Shamir: It seems they caused the merchants unnecessary confusion by disguising themselves as Almyrans.
Alois: We taught the pirates a lesson though. That should calm them down a bit. I know this was more than you signed up for, but you really saved us!
Byleth: It was an interesting experience.
Byleth: It was good training. 
Shamir: Thanks for your help. This can't be how you were expecting your day to go.
Alois: Patient and understanding, just like Captain Jeralt. We owe you a token of our appreciation, I think. Take the reward from the Merchants' Association. Share it with your students, if you like.
Byleth: Really?
Byleth: I can't accept this.
Shamir: Take it. We'll collect our reward from the Eastern Church. Besides, Alois could never keep it for himself.
Alois: Of course not! We knights serve as the sword and shield of Saint Seiros herself. We pride ourselves on our integrity! We reject all rewards that are not perfectly legitimate!
Shamir: In other words, he's a coward who would feel guilty and lose sleep over it.
Alois: Hmph.
Shamir: That's also one of his many merits.
Alois: Shamir, you don't mince words. Though it does seem like you've learned how to show a little respect.
Shamir: Must've learned that from you.
Alois: I don't remember teaching you that. Anyway, Professor, keep the compensation. I'd say you've earned it. Those merchants really needed your help. For all the buying and selling they do, they're not so good at trading blows!
Shamir: ...
Alois: Get it, trading blows? They... And merchants, they... Oh, forget it.
Shamir: We have to prepare for our next mission. Until next time, Professor.

@Opening 
Annette and Gilbert hope to acquire the Hero's Relic of House Dominic from Annette's uncle, Baron Dominic.

@Intro 
Gilbert: Professor, do you have a moment?
Byleth: Of course.
Gilbert: I would hear your opinion on our situation. Given our current fighting power, what sort of challenge do you expect we pose to the Empire? Do we have any hope of victory?
Byleth: Our preparations are lacking.
Byleth: The probability of victory is low.
Gilbert: So, we agree. However, in order to strengthen our forces, we--

Annette: Aaaargh! Ugh, why would anyone put a barrel here?!

Annette: Ow, that really smarts... Oh. Hello, Father.
Byleth: Father?
Gilbert: ... Another stupendous fall.
Annette: As though you care about my well-being. Anyway... Professor, I'm heading out for a bit.
Byleth: Where are you going?
Annette: I was thinking of going to visit my uncle.
Gilbert: To see my brother? Why is that, Annette?
Annette: I wanna ask him to entrust me with the Hero's Relic of House Dominic. The fight from here on out is gonna be tough. I need to do whatever I can to get stronger. The best thing we can do, as far as I can tell, is to have another Hero's Relic at our disposal.
Gilbert: You are not wrong, yet it will not be easy.
Byleth: Why's that?
Gilbert: Under pressure from Cornelia, House Dominic is maintaining a pro-Imperial stance. That makes us his enemy. Brother or no, he will not hand over a Hero's Relic to us.
Annette: But he's not a bad person... And we'll never know unless we ask, right? And Mother might be there too...
Gilbert: The Dominic region is, at present, enemy territory. There is no guarantee you can see them safely.
Annette: Fine. Be that way. It's not like I was planning to ask for your help, anyway. Professor, don't worry about me. I'll be back soon, and with a Relic, no less!
Gilbert: Annette! Wait! She never listens. So frustrating. However, if she were able to retrieve the Hero's Relic, it would prove a great boon to our forces. Perhaps I should prepare myself for the worst. I shall travel with Annette to see my brother. Professor, might I ask you to take on a task for me? It is entirely possible that we shall be captured in the Dominic region. In anticipation of that... I would ask that you wait outside the region, with an army at your command.
Byleth: Of course. 
Gilbert: I cannot say with confidence that we will be able to bring back the Hero's Relic without issue. While it pains me to ask this favor of you, I must also thank you for accepting.
Byleth: I need some time... 
Gilbert: I should be able to slow Annette's departure for a short while, at the least. Please join us when you can.

@Battle 
Annette: Uncle, I beg you! Please give me the Hero's Relic!
Baron Dominic: Even in this land, the Empire's eye shines bright. To hand over such a weapon to you, our enemy, is unthinkable...
Gilbert: We are well aware. Brother, I beg you. For the sake of the Kingdom's revival...
Baron Dominic: I cannot. If it becomes known that I gave you aid, my lands will be annexed in a bitter instant.
Gilbert: Then we must relent. Annette, there is nothing for us here. We should go.
Baron Dominic: No. Letting you simply leave will invite accusations of collusion. I must take you as my hostages.
Gilbert: So... It has come to pass after all.
Baron Dominic: Annette, live here with me. You needn't return to that helpless band of rebels without a glimmer of hope for victory.
Annette: You're wrong! That will never happen, Uncle!
Baron Dominic: Your mother is also here in this land. Do not dismiss my proposition so readily...

Annette: We can't afford to stay here. Father, we have to run!
Gilbert: Be calm, Annette. I assumed something like this would happen. If we do not come back, the professor will come to get us. We need but wait and keep faith...

Kingdom Soldier: Our allies are being held in that stronghold in the southeast! Please, rescue them quickly! 

Baron Dominic: Ha! Right to the last, you hope to strike me down. In that case, I will also lay my cards on the table and commit all my resources to this fight!
Gilbert: Reinforcements?! That will make life more difficult. 

Annette: Oh, thank goodness! Let's run, Father!
Gilbert: Annette, go. I will acquire the Hero's Relic, even if it means crossing blades with my brother.
Annette: I couldn't possibly leave you to do it alone! Father, please let me go with you!
Baron Dominic: Even if you must do it by force, bring me Annette! 

@Character-Falls 
Annette: Gah... Leave me be!
Baron Dominic: It's for your own good. You must understand, Annette.

Gilbert: I am soldier enough to admit I have lost this battle. Brother, I will lay down arms...

@Boss 
Baron Dominic: I have my own reason for not giving up. And the less I speak of it, the better...

%Gilbert,Baron Dominic
Gilbert: My brother, I beg you...the Relic!
Baron Dominic: I do not wish to repeat myself! If you want it that badly, slay me and claim it for your own

%Annette,Baron Dominic
Baron Dominic: I have no wish to enact violence on you, Annette. Listen to me and do as I say.
Annette: I will not listen! I can't and I won't! There is somewhere I must return to!

@End 
Baron Dominic: So...this is it. I fought well, in the end. I doubt Cornelia will think I cooperated with you. Take the Hero's Relic and go. And in return...promise to restore the Kingdom.
Gilbert: Brother... I thank you.
Baron Dominic: And don't worry about your wife. Whatever happens, I swear I will protect her. When all of this is over, you had better return to her. Make sure victory is yours...Gustave.
Gilbert: You have my word.

Gilbert: I cannot tell you how grateful we are for your assistance.
Annette: I don't know what would have happened if not for you... And thanks to you, I got this!
Gilbert: The Magic hammer, Crusher... The Hero's Relic of House Dominic. My brother would not surrender such a Relic without a fight... I hope you understand.
Byleth: I understand.
Byleth: Of course.
Gilbert: House Dominic is one of the ten great bloodlines. Yet within the Kingdom, we are mere feudal lords. With the Empire growing in strength, Dominic must kneel. To do otherwise would be suicide. The western lords, and other rulers, are in the same situation. They all comply, albeit reluctantly. If we defeat the Empire, I hope the Kingdom will rise once more, under the banner of a legitimate king.
Annette: I hope so too. That's why we can't give up!
Gilbert: To that end, Professor, we will require your help. I hope we can continue depending on you.
Byleth: I'll do what I can.
Byleth: You can count on me.
Annette: Don't worry! We won't make you do all the hard work by yourself. I'll give it my all too! Speaking of... I'm gonna get straight to training!

Annette: Gaaaaaah! Why would someone put a dumb wooden box here?!
Gilbert: And please, look after my daughter as well.

@Opening 
Something is attacking people in the forests of Margrave Edmund's territory, and a Crest scholar blames Marianne.

@Intro 
???: Thereâs no reason to feign ignorance. I know all about you!
Marianne: Wh-what are you talking about?
???: Just come here!

Marianne: Professor! Help!
???: Donât interfere. Just hand the girl over to me.
Byleth: Never.
???: Iâm telling you this for your own good. Youâre putting yourself in danger by associating with her.
Marianne: ...
???: Do you know of the Wandering Beast stalking in the wood in the Edmund territory? It is said that it attacks people every night and drags them off to feast. The true identity of the Wandering Beast... Is that girl right there!
Marianne: No! I would never...
Byleth: Get out of here!
???: No matter. Iâll get the evidence I need...

Marianne: My apologies for you getting involved in that...
Byleth: What happened?
Marianne: In truth, that man has been following me ever since my father disappeared... Heâs a Crest scholar.
Byleth: Why is he following you?
Marianne: The Crest that my father bore and was passed down to me... It was... Mauriceâs Crest.
Byleth: Mauriceâs Crest?
Marianne: Yes. Itâs also known as...the Crest of the Beast... Itâs said there were once 12 heroes who saved FÃ³dlan. There was the King of Liberation, Nemesis...the 10 Elites, and finally...Maurice. One day, Maurice suddenly transformed into a hideous beast and slaughtered innocent people. It was like when Miklan of House Gautier turned into a Black Beast. The negative energy dwelling within his Crest turned Maurice into a monster. The people of FÃ³dlan grew to despise him, and he was stripped of his honor. His whole clan was conquered, and it was believed that his bloodline had vanished... But even now, there exist a few descendants who have inherited Mauriceâs Crest, and his curse. My family line...is one of them. Mauriceâs Crest is a symbol of disaster. Anyone who comes in contact with it is met with great misfortune. Those who carry the Crest became beasts at night and slaughter innocent people.
Byleth: What that man mentioned earlier...
Marianne: Yes, the rumor about the Wandering Beast in the woods... People are saying the creature is similar in appearance to Mauriceâs bestial form.
Byleth: If itâs defeated, wouldnât the rumor be dispelled?
Marianne: That may be true but...I doubt I could do it on my own. If you and some of the other students came with me though...
Byleth: Let's go. 
Marianne: Thank you! But, um... Promise you won't tell anyone about my Crest?
Marianne: I'm sorry to have to ask...but thank you!
Byleth: I'll think about it. 
Marianne: It is my personal matter, so I can't expect you to get involved. But if you change your mind...I'll be waiting.

@Battle 
Marianne: A-are you really the Wandering Beast that people talk about?
Wandering Beast: You... Do you bear our Crest? For what purpose did you come here?
Marianne: Our Crest? Does that mean...
Wandering Beast: It appears that your presence has been detected by bloodthirsty Demonic Beasts...

Marianne: Demonic Beasts? Everyone... Please move carefully!
Wandering Beast: This forest is the den of Demonic Beasts. You will be lucky to make it out alive.

Marianne: You saved me, Professor... Thank you. The Wandering Beast's true form... Could it be... Oh! Sorry! I need to focus on the fight! 

Marianne: Argh! I'm...not strong enough...

@Character-Falls
Marianne: Dear Goddess... My soul is yours to take...

@Battle
Wandering Beast: My beastly blood is roused... You will not be able to stop me!

@Boss
Wandering Beast: Nothing will stop me...from feasting upon your flesh and blood!

%Byleth,Wandering Beast
Wandering Beast: That sword... It's the sword of the king! Are you the one who can liberate me?!

%Marianne,Wandering Beast
Wandering Beast: Nothing will stop me...from feasting upon your flesh and blood!
Marianne: No! I won't let you!

%Claude,Wandering Beast
Claude: That looks just like Miklan's Black Beast... Could a Hero's Relic be at fault?
Wandering Beast: Hero... That is a word that takes me back.
Claude: Takes you back? You... Are you...
Wandering Beast: After so long, I cannot speak of it.

@End 
Wandering Beast: Well done... Finally, this nightmare of a thousand years is at its end. Oh, inheritor of my Crest...if this body is to decay, then the sword... I leave it to you...
Marianne: ...

Marianne: I still canât believe what we saw in that forest... The Wandering Beastâs eviscerated body... Only human bones and this sword remaining.

Marianne: Surely the creatureâs true identity was...
Crest Scholar: Iâm sorry...
Marianne: You again?
Crest Scholar: I heard rumor that the Wandering Beast was slain, but do you really believe that frees you of suspicion? Without proof that it was slain, the argument that you are not a beast does not stand. Furthermore, I... Huh? Oh! That sword!
Marianne: When the Wandering Beast was defeated, this sword...
Crest Scholar: Itâs unmistakable! Carved into that swordâs Crest stone is Mauriceâs Crest! But how would the lost Magic Blade end up with the Wandering Beast? According to what I know of Mauriceâs story, he didnât let go of the sword until the very end. That must mean... I see. So thatâs what happened... My apologies, it seems I was mistaken. I must be going.
Marianne: So the Wandering Beast was...
Byleth: Maurice himself.
Marianne: He was roaming the dark woods for over a thousand years, suffering for his murderous past.
Byleth: Someone who bears the Crest of the Beast.
Marianne: No, Iâm sure that was Maurice himself. He was roaming the dark woods for over a thousand years, suffering for his murderous past.
Byleth: Good thing you were able to put an end to it.
Marianne: Itâs true... And because of that, I feel as though...my curse has been lifted. The blood of a beast no longer flows through me. I feel human for once.

Marianne: Thank you, Professor. I couldnât have done it on my own. Without your help, I would never have found peace. Iâll do anything I can to repay my debt to you!

Flayn: Brother, please wait!
Seteth: For the last time, Flayn, the answer is no.
Flayn: You are departing for the Rhodos Coast, are you not? I must come!
Seteth: You will do no such thing. I am not going there to pay respects at the cemetery, but to do battle. With you there, I will be beside myself with worry. It will be easier for me to fight if I know you are safe.
Flayn: But...I must!

Flayn: Professor! You have come at just the right time.
Byleth: What's going on?
Flayn: Surely it must be fate that you have appeared at a time of my greatest need!
Byleth: I don't like the sound of that...
Flayn: I only wish to make a small request.
Flayn: My dear brother is about to set forth on a most dangerous mission.
Byleth: A mission?
Seteth: Indeed. The Western Church is attempting to seize sacred ground by force. Though they now have a new bishop, it seems that a radical faction has emerged to resist the new order. We cannot allow the holy artifacts enshrined there to fall into their hands.
Flayn: I, too, wish to be of use to the church! And I do admit I am terribly worried about my brother. No matter my protests, he will not allow me to come. Professor, this is where you can help. Will you accompany us both on this expedition?
Byleth: Why me?
Flayn: If you are there to protect me, my brother's fears will be allayed. Isn't that right, Brother?
Seteth: I suppose your aid would indeed be useful, yes.
Flayn: I knew it! Please, Professor, will you join us?
Byleth: Very well. 
Flayn: Wonderful. Let us depart at once!
Byleth: Not right now. 
Flayn: Please tend to your errands promptly. Then you will come along with us, yes?
Seteth: There is still time before we must depart. If you are able to accompany us, let me know.

@Battle
Priest: You heretics, who defile our goddess! The sacred coast belongs to us, the Western Church!
Seteth: You are the heretics! Begone from here at once!
Priest: Silence, dog of the apostate! Prepare to receive our righteous blades!

Seteth: I will recapture the monument. Everyone else should focus on removing the surrounding enemies.
Flayn: Wait, Brother! I shall accompany you!

Flayn: Leave! Let Mother rest in peace!

Priest: It is our duty to worship Saint Cichol! We will not allow heretics to come near!

Priest: It's like the goddess herself commanded me to live... I must offer her my thanks.
Seteth: The goddess doesn't want your thanks!

Priest: But it was...for the sake of the goddess...

Priest: The goddess protects us! We will never yield to the likes of you!

Priest: I got away, thanks to the protection of the goddess!
Seteth: Insufferable arrogance! We'll have to send someone after them...

Priest: Goddess... Have you abandoned us?

Priest: Heretics! Prepare to taste the power of the true servants of the goddess!

Priest: We're no match for them... Brothers... Retreat...
Seteth: Do you dare compound your crimes further? There will be no escape for you!

Seteth: That is the last of them. Flayn...will you place some flowers at the monument?
Flayn: Of course, Brother. That is what I came here to do.

@Character-Falls 
Flayn: This place... is very precious to me... please... protected it... for me...

Seteth: I must pull back... I leave the rest to you. Do not let them take this position.

@End 
Seteth: Your assistance is most appreciated. I can only hope that the Western Church will now see reason and abandon this place. But just to be safe, I have retrieved the holy artifacts. We cannot risk them falling into their hands. I will entrust them to you. I must confess, despite the situation, it was a pleasure to return here. This coast has a certain sentimental significance to my sister and me.
Byleth: Sentimental significance?
Seteth: Yes. This stone monument is not merely here to commemorate Saint Cichol. It is also the grave of my wife.
Flayn: You are safe now, Mother. Finally, you may find peace.
Byleth: Your mother is also buried here?
Seteth: I suppose you have earned the right to know. But this must remain between us. Flayn is actually my daughter. My late wife and her mother are the same person.
Byleth: I had no idea.
Seteth: Due to certain...circumstances, it is more convenient for us to masquerade as siblings for the time being.
Byleth: I suspected as much.
Seteth: And here I thought we had hidden it skillfully.
Seteth: There are many who would seek to harm Flayn due to the unique blood she bears. Falsifying her identity is necessary to conceal her from such individuals. Mercifully, I happen to look quite young for my age. We make rather convincing siblings, do we not?
Byleth: That's true enough.
Byleth: If you say so.
Seteth: Hm. I was certain our cover was adequate.
Flayn: Mother loved the coast so much. She and I came here together often. Fishing was her favorite pastime. I used to sit and watch while she cast her line.
Seteth: I remember it fondly. You did so love to eat the fish she caught, as well.
Flayn: Fish is my favorite food, it is true. Due in no small part to Mother.
Seteth: I still come here to fish, from time to time, using the skills my wife taught me. It reminds me how deeply I appreciate those years... and how I wish I could return to them.
Flayn: We cannot turn back the clock, Father. We must live our lives fully, in the present moment.
Seteth: You're right. That is what she always said, isn't it? Dwell too much on the past, and you may be unable to move forward. Come, then. Let us return home.
Flayn: Good-bye, Mother. I love you. I shall bring flowers again for you next time.

@Opening 
Dedue receives a concerning missive about his people, who continue to bear the burden of oppression based on blame for the Tragedy of Duscur.

@Intro 
Dedue: ...

Byleth: Has something happened?
Byleth: What's on your mind?
Dedue: Ohâit's you, Professor. Since you are here, I have a favor to ask.

Dedue: Your Highness. You've returned.
Dimitri: Sorry to keep you waiting, Dedue. I'm glad you're here as well, Professor. I want you both to hear this. Dedue is already aware, but you should know there's been an uprising in the Duscur region, in the western part of the Kingdom.
Byleth: An uprising in Duscur? Why?
Dimitri: Dedue... Would you like me to explain?
Dedue: No. It should be me.  I am from Duscur. It lies just beyond the mountains on the northwestern border of Faerghus. But the people of Duscur no longer live there. The land was burned to ashes by the army of Faerghus. All of the people were slaughtered.  This was our punishment for the crime of regicide.
Dimitri: 
Dedue: The barren expanse that was once Duscur is now controlled by a Kingdom noble. But Duscur survivors, such as myself, still exist outside the region. This uprising is most likely the work of such survivors, seeking to reclaim their homeland.
Dimitri: A request for aid was sent from Viscount Kleiman to the Kingdom capital and the church. He is the one who rules over that region at present. For now, the lords surrounding the Duscur region have sent their armies to help suppress the uprising. However...
Byleth: Is there a problem?
Byleth: Are they short on troops?
Dimitri: They have sufficient troops, and strong ones at that. My worry is that there will be more unwarranted death. There have always been many in the Kingdom's army who believe the people of Duscur our foes, and hate them because of it. You would think they'd refrain from squashing the rebels out of political expediency...but I doubt that will be the case. If the Kingdom's army and the rebel forces of Duscur collide, there is no doubt that the rebel forces will be annihilated. I'm afraid...that's the best case scenario. It could also turn into complete and bloody chaos for both sides.
Dedue:  Indeed.
Dimitri: Which brings me to my news. I have just now received the permission I requested from the church.
Byleth: Permission for what?
Dimitri: I asked the church to deploy our class to help handle the situation.
Dedue: So we may go?
Dimitri: Not so fast. We still have a responsibility as students of the academy, after all. The only one who can truly make the decision as to whether or not we go is our professor. So... What do you say?
Byleth: Very well. 
Dedue: You have my most sincere gratitude.
Dimitri: And mine as well. But we must move fast. I will go and alert the others.
Byleth: Let me think about it. 
Dimitri: I know this was sudden, but given the situation, I'm afraid there isn't much time to ponder. When you've decided, please speak with me right away.
Dedue: Please, decide quickly.

@Battle 
Dedue: The Kingdom's vanguard has already arrived. Just as we'd feared, they far outclass the Duscur forces. We cannot stand by and allow another massacre. But we cannot obstruct the Faerghus army, either. Our best hope is to force the troops of Duscur to withdraw before the Kingdom soldiers get to them.
Dimitri: The main body of the Kingdom's army is bound to arrive soon. Until then, let's aim to quell this uprising ourselves. Once the main force arrives, we'll be out of options. We must move fast.

Dimitri: It seems the church and the Kingdom troops are not working together. My head hurts just thinking about it, but we may be able to use that. First, let's push Duscur to retreat. The Kingdom might then also withdraw without a fight.
Dedue: Let us be quick about it.

Duscur Soldier: Our grudge will not be settled...until all of you are dead and buried!

Kingdom General: Split up between the east and the west, and advance! That'll put the squeeze on those Duscur animals in a hurry!
Dedue: They are moving out. Time is of the essence, now.

Kingdom General: Seems this area's done already. All right, men! Fall back!

Kingdom General: OK, looks like they're already under control. Let's head back now.

Kingdom Soldier: We're here to quell this rebellion, starting now. Hunt down those filthy beasts, and give no quarter!
Dedue: The main army has arrived. We stand no chance against those numbers. We took too long. It is all over...

Duscur Soldier: I give my all for our goal! You will die here!

Dedue: Go now if you value your life.
Duscur Soldier: But aren't you with Faerghus? In any case... Thank you.

Dedue: You can still get out of here. Run.

Duscur Soldier: You're not going to kill us?! Well, I won't wait here to find out. I'm leaving!
Dedue: Safely away.

Duscur Soldier: I won't allow it... If only you dastards weren't here...
Kingdom Soldier: I'll have your life for atonement, king slayer!

Duscur Soldier: Heretics... What is it you think...we have done?
Kingdom Soldier: Filthy Duscur demons...

Duscur Soldier: Revenge for my brothers...even at the cost of death...
Kingdom Soldier: Not content with slaying His Majesty, you thought to revolt?! Pathetic!

@Boss 
%Dedue,Duscur General
Duscur General: You...are a man of Duscur. How can you make friends with our hated foes? Is it possible that you've lost your Duscur spirit?
Dedue: Are you finished?

%Dimitri,Duscur General
Duscur General: Now, this is a windfall... Who knew we'd meet our sworn enemy here!
Dimitri: Sworn enemy? Well, I cannot disagree.
Duscur General: We will slay you and topple Faerghus! That way, for the first time in ages...Duscur can be reborn!
Dimitri: Hmph.

@End 
Duscur General: Is this...how our dream ends...
Dimitri: I will check the status of the Kingdom troops. Dedue, I leave the Duscur army to you.
Dedue: Yes, Your Highness. Please be careful.

Duscur General: Why save us?
Dedue: I will not abide the needless death of my own people.
Duscur General: You must know that as long as there is breath in me, I will fight.
Dedue: Then fight, and be defeated. But so long as you pose no threat to His Highness, I will not end your life.
Duscur General: Idealistic fool. We will not relent. Not until we've taken back the homeland you monsters stole from us!
Dedue: I share the same sentiment.
Duscur General: You? Who sold his soul for Faerghus?
Dedue: His Highness has promised the people of Duscur a home. His will be a kingdom that is proud to harbor the blood of both Faerghus and Duscur.
Duscur General: That's impossible. Don't be naive.
Dedue: Believe what you will. But Faerghus will change under his reign. That is my firm belief.
Duscur General: ...

Dimitri: The Kingdom army has retreated to the fortress. There should be no further danger.
Duscur General: Prince of Faerghus! You monster!
Dimitri: Can you still run? Then I suggest you do so now.


Duscur General: ...
Dedue: May our paths cross again.
Duscur General:  I certainly hope not. But remember this one thing. The people of Duscur never forget their grudges. Nor do they fail to honor favors.

Dedue: Thank you, Your Highness, for accommodating my selfish request.
Dimitri: Think nothing of it. This was something I wished for, as well. If you must give thanks, direct it at the church for allowing us to join the battle, and to our professor for leading the charge. It's about time we headed back. The professor and the others are waiting.
Dedue: I am right behind you.

@Opening 
Almyran forces are attacking FÃ³dlan's Locket. With her brother suddenly fallen ill, it is up to Hilda to take over the defense. Cyril volunteers to accompany her.

@Intro 
Hilda: Hey, Professor. I might have to go back home for a little while.
Byleth: Is someone in your family sick?
Hilda: Oh no, nothing like that.
Byleth: Is there some kind of emergency?
Hilda: Well, that's one way of putting it...
Hilda: The Almyran forces are causing trouble at FÃ³dlan's Locket. Oh, do you know where that is? Well, the mountain range that separates the Alliance from Almyra is called FÃ³dlan's Throat. There's a fortress right on top of the throat, and they call that FÃ³dlan's Locket.
Byleth: So, you're going to help defend it?
Hilda: Well, yeah, you could say that. I'm sure my brother would be able to handle them on his own. But he said he really wants me to help out. I guess he's a bit tired out from all his hard work. Anyway, our dad's not as sprightly as he used to be. He's not up for a fight. Apparently it would look bad if we left it to the retainers. I really, really don't want to go, but I guess I have to.

Cyril: Heya, Hilda. I...well, I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but I heard ya talking...
Hilda: Hm? Oh, what's up, Cyril?
Cyril: You're gonna fight the Almyrans, yeah?
Hilda: Yes. But it's nothing you need to worry about, Cyril.
Cyril: It's not that. I was just wondering if...if maybe I could maybe go along with ya?
Hilda: But--you'd be fighting people from your homeland. Do you really want to do that?
Cyril: None of 'em would remember me anyway... It's just that...I got captured in the battle at the Locket, and that's how I ended up here. So I'm kinda worried that other kids who lose their folks might not be so lucky.
Byleth: What do you mean?
Cyril: Before Lady Rhea took me in, I had a real hard time as a servant of House Goneril.
Hilda: I'm sorry to hear that. But it's not like I'll go around snapping up Almyran children.
Cyril: That's good, but I just... I want to see things for myself, so I know...that everything's OK.
Hilda: Hm. Well then, let's go together! Oh, would you want to join us, Professor? My brother will be there, but I'm a little scared about fighting all those fierce Almyrans...
Cyril: If you could come too, it would be really great. We'd all feel way safer if you did.
Byleth: I'll come with you. 
Hilda: Great! I know we'll be OK if you're there! Let's head out right away.
Cyril: I'll go and get ready too.
Byleth: I'll think it over. 
Hilda: You're a real tease, Professor. I know you're going to come along in the end. But we can't wait long, so hurry up on deciding.

@Battle 
Hilda: Most of our allies have fallen. My big brother and I can probably handle this though...
Goneril Soldier: Hilda! Glad you made it! Lord Holst has been afflicted with a sudden illness and couldn't come...
Hilda: He's not here?! Oh... I'm sorry. You must have been absolutely terrified. It's OK though! I brought along someone who can definitely help us! That's you, Professor. Please help us save our allies and protect FÃ³dlan's Locket.

Cyril: Good thing I knew about this back road, huh? We oughta be able to help our friends from here.

Goneril Soldier: Support! We're saved!

Goneril Soldier: Argh... No help came...
Hilda: Oh no! They got one...but we can still rescue the others!

Goneril Soldier: We must defend here, or else... Our house... The Alliance...
Hilda: All our allied troops were wiped out. We won't be able to defend this place.

Hilda: Ah, things are looking up. Let's keep going, and save the others!

Hilda: We did it somehow. Cyril, Professor--thank you.
Cyril: You bet.
Hilda: I'm gonna drop by my family's estate and complain to my brother a bit. You two should head back.

@End 
Cyril: They aren't really trying to cross FÃ³dlan's Throat. I'm not saying they're not serious, but fights like this one aren't really invasions.
Byleth: Then what are they doing?
Cyril: They just start fights like this sometimes. It's so they can show off how strong they are. I think it's pretty dumb. I mean, people are getting killed! And why? So some guy can think he's tough? After every fight, they do a big feast, and everybody eats and dances and there's music... It's supposed to honor the dead, but I figure they just like to make noise. I think they're all idiots, but if I'm real honest, it wasn't the worst way to live life.
Byleth: Feeling homesick?
Cyril: Nah, I'm where I belong now, and I don't really like Almyra. If they wanna show how tough they are, then they oughta look after kids who've lost their parents.

Hilda: Whew, I'm tired. Professor, Cyril, thanks for all your help.
Cyril: You get a chance to see your brother?
Hilda: I did. Though I think I'd be better off otherwise. He was horribly ill, for one thing. He looked so pale and haggard. Apparently he'd eaten a bad mushroom before the battle and it made him horribly sick. What an idiot. Anyway, when I told him we'd handled the Almyran situation, he was just gushing with praise. I tried telling him that it wasn't all me, but he didn't even listen.
Byleth: Weren't you glad to get praise from your brother?
Hilda: That did feel pretty good, I'll admit. But then things got awkward. He started trying to pawn off his whole inheritance. I told him I wanted none of it! Eventually he settled for foisting this thing on me. Do you know what it is?

Cyril: One heck of an axe. He gave it to ya?
Hilda: Yes. It's a magic axe called Freikugel. It's the Hero's Relic of House Goneril. He said that I should have it, since the Crest I bear will allow me to wield it. He was so insistent, I eventually relented. But I don't think I can be responsible for something so precious. Hey, Professor... Why don't you take it instead?
Byleth: You should keep it.
Byleth: Why me?
Hilda: Heroes' Relics contain terrifying power. They're beyond the capabilities of a novice like me. You're the only person I trust to take care of it. Please, help me out here!
Byleth: If you're sure...
Byleth: If you really think it's necessary...
Hilda: Thank you so much! I honestly didn't know what I was going to do with this thing! A big scary axe is not my style. Plus, look closely--parts of the axe are pulsating, like it's alive! How gross is that? But I'll use it if you tell me to, Professor. Or you can get somebody else to wield it, if you like. It's all up to you now!

Byleth: ...
Cyril: That Hilda... She really is something.

@Opening 
When Catherine and the Knights of Seiros ride out to seek retribution against the Western Church for their attack on the archbishop, Ashe is eager to accompany them.

@Intro 
Catherine: There you are. I have a request for you.
Byleth: A request?
Catherine: It has to do with that plot to assassinate Lady Rhea. The bishop leading the Western Church was somehow involved.
Catherine: And speaking of the Western Church, there was also that incident in which one of the more extreme factions tried to occupy sacred land.
Catherine: Enough is enough, so now the Knights of Seiros have been tasked with putting the bishop down. I thought you and your students could come with us.
Byleth: Why would you want us to help?
Byleth: Why for such an important mission?
Catherine: Because you wield the Sword of the Creator. Lady Rhea is going to personally execute the bishop. I have been appointed as her guard. I want your help protecting her. So what do you say? Will you come?

Ashe: Um, excuse me! Iâd like to come along.
Catherine: Ashe! You were listening in? Itâs not up to you whether you can âcome along.â
Ashe: Please, this is important to me.
Catherine: Your adoptive father, Lord Lonato, had connections to the Western Church. I understand that you want answers. But our objective is to punish, not to investigate. We canât let you jeopardize the mission.
Ashe: I wonât get in the way, I promise!
Catherine: Hm... What do you say, Professor? Keep in mind we would be bringing the whole class, not just Ashe.
Byleth: Weâll go. 
Ashe: Thank you so much.
Catherine: OK. I guess itâs fine. Get ready, then.
Byleth: Iâm not sure. 
Catherine: Hm. Well, canât hurt to wait a bit, I suppose. Do let me know when you finish your preparations. This is an important mission.

@Battle 
Bishop: There she is -- The sneaky little witch trying to pass herself off as the goddessâs envoy... Archbishop Rhea! Iâll bring judgment upon you in the goddessâs stead!
Catherine: Theyâre using the fog as cover to ambush us. What a cheap ploy.
Rhea: It wonât do any good to get annoyed, Catherine. That voice... Weâre up against a faction of bishops.
Catherine: Theyâve shown themselves, at least, so we wonât have to go to the trouble of finding them. All right. You got a death wish? Come at me! You really want to fight against Thunder Catherine?

Catherine: Please, Professor. Donât let Lady Rhea get hurt. Our mission isnât just to wipe out all the enemies, but also to protect Lady Rhea. Ready?

Ashe: Lady Rhea!
Catherine: Hold the line! Don't let them attack Lady Rhea again.

Rhea: They have received reinforcements, and it seems the priests are calling them over.
Ashe: Then we'll just have to take them out!

Rhea: It seems that taking out the priest has stopped the reinforcements coming over here. We should be able to stop the reinforcements coming from the other side by taking care of the other priest.

Rhea: They will not be able to send any more troops now. Let us sweep up the stragglers.
Catherine: Good work, Lady Rhea! Let's round 'em up and cut 'em down.

@Boss 
Bishop: Apostates will suffer the punishment of the goddess!

%Ashe,Bishop
Ashe: Lonatoâs blood is on your hands...
Bishop: Were you Lord Lonatoâs page or something? Indeed, he was a devout believer. All we did was provide Lord Lonato salvation from his misery!
Ashe: Salvation?! You used him and threw him away!

@End 
Bishop: Apostates! You sully the name of the goddess!
Rhea: You are the apostates! The goddess is with me!

Rhea: Goddess, have mercy. Forgive them their sins, and save their souls...
Catherine: It would have been better if weâd captured the bishop. But they didnât make it easy for us. What now, Lady Rhea?
Rhea: We must go to the headquarters of the Western Church. Perhaps there is still someone there who knows what has transpired.
Ashe: Let us help too. It may not be much, but weâll do whatever we can!
Rhea: I am sure you will be a great help. I am glad to have you by my side.

Catherine: Thanks, Professor. I really appreciated your help with the investigation. Thatâs it for today. Head back to Garreg Mach. The church will have to choose a new bishop, and do whatever else is necessary to rebuild the Western Church. Lady Rhea is grateful to all of you. She said she would send along a reward. You should feel very proud. Receiving a gift directly from Lady Rhea is exceedingly rare. Still. That was a real mess, huh? For them to come out and charge us so boldly...
Byleth: Iâm glad we made it out.
Catherine: As am I. We kept Lady Rhea safe, thanks to you.
Byleth: I thought we were doomed.
Catherine: I did too. But we made it out somehow, thanks to you.
Catherine: Hey, where did Ashe go? I havenât seen him for a while.
Byleth: No idea.
Catherine: Could he still be back there? Iâm glad heâs so dedicated to his work, but...
Byleth: He couldnât still be back there, could he?
Catherine: That may be it. I hope heâs not getting in the way...

Catherine: There you are, Ashe. We were just talking about...
Ashe: ...
Catherine: Why the brooding expression? Hey, whatâs that bundle of papers in your hand?
Ashe: This was given to me. It has to do with my family.
Byleth: Given to you?
Byleth: Is this about Lord Lonato?
Ashe: I havenât finished reading it all yet. But I think it might offer some clues about something I need to know. Professor, Catherine. Thank you for letting me come with you on this mission. Iâd better get ready to go.

Catherine: Itâs a little painful to watch... I do hope that those papers, whatever they are, will help him get over his past. I suppose itâs time for us to start heading back to the monastery.

@Opening 
Manuela and Hanneman have predictably opposite reactions to a disturbing rumor going around the monastery.

@Intro 
Manuela: It's raining, Professor. On rainy days, the wound I got from the Death Knight hurts like fire. Every time it aches, I get angry. You understand, yeah? I'm sure they had their reasons to kidnap Flayn, but still... Did they really need to stab me? What'd I have to do with it?! They ruined my beautiful, porcelain skin. Worse, they took off before I could stab them back. So rude.

Hanneman: That's rather enough, Manuela. Cease your moaning and give the professor a break.
Manuela: Oh, stuff it, Hanneman. Unlike you, the professor has a big heart and listens to me talk about any problem I have.
Hanneman: More likely, your incessant ramblings offer no chance to interrupt.
Manuela: Is that true, Professor?
Byleth: Manuela isn't bothering me. 
Manuela: I knew it. You listen to me because you care about me, don't you?
Byleth: Professor Hanneman is right. 
Hanneman: You heard that, didn't you, Manuela? You are bothering the professor.
Manuela: Go away, Hanneman! Leave us alone. And stop making me shout! it causes the old wound to hurt again.
Hanneman: Then perhaps you'd best stay quiet. Keep your emotions in check, I'd say.
Byleth: Let's stop this now.
Byleth: Let's all get along.
Manuela: Don't worry, Professor. We do this all the time.
Hanneman: Indeed, Manuela and I do not mix well. Been true for years. That said, if it were up to me, I would prefer speaking to her in a calmer manner.
Manuela: It's not like I enjoy bickering with you. So maybe keep your mouth shut more often.
Hanneman: I state that which needs to be heard! For example--
Byleth: Let's stop this now.
Byleth: Let's all get along.
Manuela: I'm sorry. I couldn't help it...
Hanneman: Same, same. Apologies. I am here because I have new information on the Death Knight's hiding place.
Manuela: What? Really?! You could have started with that.
Hanneman: Several students have reported possible sightings on the western edge of the Sealed Forest. While the authenticity of these reports has yet to be verified, it is still a very real possibility. I was thinking I would report this to Seteth as a precaution.
Manuela: What? Why? We can't be slow! He's going to get away!
Hanneman: Protocol on this matter requires reporting to Seteth, then Lady Rhea, then...
Manuela: Professor, let's leave this old geezer behind and get going!
Hanneman: Old geezer? I am barely 15 years your senior! I will not hear such--
Manuela: Stop talking! Let's gather a team and get going!
Byleth: I agree. 
Manuela: I'll go scout ahead. I'm coming for you, Death Knight!
Hanneman: Manuela, wait! It would not do to get yourself killed without someone to avenge you!
Byleth: Not yet... 
Manuela: Well, I'm going ahead anyway. You can't stop me.
Hanneman: Manuela, take a moment. You must prepare before heading out! Professor, please let me know as soon as you can if you could join us.

@Battle 
Hanneman: Manuela's in a tough spot, Professor. Even if she's only got herself to blame, we cannot abandon her.
Bandit Leader: Heh... We have plenty of visitors today. Let's stop their annoying rescue attempt!

Bandit: Now that is a woman...
Manuela: Uh-oh. They've noticed me. Here they come!

Thief: Just when I decide to disguise myself as a mountain bandit and sneak in, we get attacked. Just my luck!

@Boss 
Bandit Leader: We are the Death God Gang! We're all unstoppable!

%Manuela,Bandit Leader
Manuela: Hey! You're not the Death Knight! What gives?
Bandit Leader: Death Knight? What nonsense are you talking now? Do we look like knights to you, lady?
Manuela: You're just lousy hill bandits. Well, I'll teach you to waste my time!

%Hanneman,Bandit Leader
Hanneman: Why, there is no Death Knight here. That student's testimony was, well, it was utter bunk!
Bandit Leader: Hey, you! The weird old dude with the beard! What kinda crap are you mumbling to yourself there?
Hanneman: I beg your pardon?! Do not image you can insult me without some form of retribution!

@End 
Hanneman: Manuela, are you uninjured?
Manuela: A few scrapes and bruises. But, yes, I'm well enough.

Manuela: How could anyone think that was the Death Knight? It was obviously just an ordinary bandit. Oh well, I may not have found my revenge, but at least we got to retrieve stolen goods.
Hanneman: Manuela! You unthinking fool!
Manuela: Hanneman, I've heard enough already.
Hanneman: How bloody stupid are you?! If that were the real Death Knight, you'd have new--likely fatal--wounds to match your first! Do you know how much you worried all of us? You should be ashamed!
Manuela: Oh no...
Byleth: Relax. She's OK.
Hanneman: This is a matter of life and death! It should not and must not be taken lightly!
Byleth: Hanneman's right.
Hanneman: Exactly! You are supposed to set an example for our students. Yet you let emotion get the better of you?
Manuela: You're right... So there, I said that. It's true, but, ugh. I'm sorry. I'll apologize to everyone later.
Hanneman: I should say I'm sorry as well. I lost my temper just now. I see you act so irrationally, and I lose my wits. I care about you a great deal, and wish to see you safe. Will you believe me?
Manuela: Yes, of course. I'm the same way, after all. I let my emotions get the best of me. We're both too old to be shouting all the time.
Byleth: So, everyone is friends again?
Manuela: You're awfully quick to but a bow on this. Are you sick of us already, Professor?
Hanneman: You're part of this, Professor. We are the only teachers this academy has. No need for bickering!
Manuela: Well said, Hanneman. Would you care to join me for a celebratory drink?
Hanneman: That sounds lovely. Perhaps a nice cup of tea is in order.

@Opening 
Sothis has a request for you, Byleth... At her insistence, you travel alone to the Red Canyon, followed by curious students.

@Intro 
Sothis: Hmmm... What was that name again?
Byleth: What's on your mind?
Sothis: Oh, this is frustrating me to no end! I simply can't recall. Oh, I have it! Zanado!
Byleth: Zanado, the Red Canyon?
Sothis: That's it! It was not long ago that we were there... And still, I somehow managed to forget!
Byleth: Where we defeated the thieves....
Sothis: That's it! It was not long ago that we were there... And still, I somehow managed to forget!
Byleth: What is that?
Sothis: Oh my, your memory is even worse than mine. It was not long ago that we were there!
Byleth: What about it?
Sothis: Well... That place brought back some fragments of my memory. I cannot help but wonder why. I feel we must return to find some answers there.
Byleth: Let's go. 
Sothis: Yes, you are right! For as the saying goes, there is no time like the present.
Byleth: Now isn't the time. 
Sothis: No? You must delight in spoiling my mood... Well, if you refuse to go, there's little I can do... Please tell me if you change your mind.

Edelgard: Hmm... Our professor is sneaking off alone. Where to, I wonder...
Hubert: I don't recall hearing of any such plans for our class. Perhaps we should follow.
Edelgard: Intrigued, are we? Yes, let's do just that. We will consider it...extra training.

Dimitri: It is most unlike our professor to go wandering alone like that...
Dedue: Curious, Your Highness?
Dimitri: Yes. I have an uneasy feeling about this. Let's gather the others and find out what is going on.

Hilda: Huh? Where's our professor going all alone like that?
Claude: I hate not knowing what's going on... OK, that's it. Let's gather the others and get to the bottom of this.
Hilda: You want to follow our teacher?! What a pain... Ugh, but I guess I'm dying of curiosity too.

Sothis: Yes... It is all coming back to me. This structure... Oh, but it's as though my memories are clouded. The most important pieces are obscured. But I once called this home. I have no doubt. I seem to recall something...on the other side of that wall. I cannot see it, but I can still feel it... It is not my imagination. I know this to be true. We are already deep within this valley...
???: Grrrraargh!
Sothis: Oh! What was that awful sound?!
Byleth: You heard something?
Sothis: This is not time to joke around! Do not pretend you didn't hear!
Byleth: It was a terrible scream.
Sothis: Yes. And that was not a normal beast, but a huge and terrifying one!
Sothis: Look! There! At the entrance of the valley...a giant shadow!

@Battle 
Sothis: What is it now?!
Sothis: Those hungry wolves... That howl must have riled them up. We have no choice but to fight our way out. Give it your all!

Hubert: It's good we've caught up with the professor, but this situation is--hard to put into words, actually.
Edelgard: Wolves to the front, hawks to the rear, and what appears to be a Demonic Beast at the canyon's mouth...
Hubert: A wild beast, at that. Or perhaps it's more fitting to call it a stray.
Edelgard: If we can't prevail over that Demonic Beast, we won't make it out of the Red Canyon alive.

Edelgard: The first thing we need to do is reunite with our professor. The wolves are closing in...

Edelgard: More hawks... This is bad. We'll be caught from both sides!

Edelgard: The hawks are still coming. Perhaps we should see to those before we deal with the beast.

Dimitri: This is bad... It's a good thing we managed to catch up with our professor.
Dedue: Wolves at the front. Hawks at the rear. And at the canyon mouth, a Demonic Beast.
Dimitri: Or perhaps to call it a stray beast would be most fitting... If we cannot take out the beast, I doubt we will ever see the monastery again.

Dimitri: We must help our professor, first and foremost. This is a tough situation for anyone.

Dimitri: They must hope to catch us from both sides.

Dimitri: Blast! More hawks! We should probably take those out before we approach that beast...

Claude: It was the right move for us to follow Teach. But however you look at it, we're in a tough spot now...
Hilda: Wolves, hawks...not to mention a Demonic Beast guarding the canyon's entrance! We should never have come here.
Claude: Don't say that! But what's a Demonic Beast doing here? Is it a stray? Even Teach would have trouble out here all alone. Let's help out before we're down one professor!

Claude: First thing's first. We need to reunite with Teach. Hurry up, everyone!

Claude: Great...more hawks. Those feathery jerks are trying to take us out from both sides!

Claude: More hawks?! The air's swarming with those feathered freaks! Let's get them before we fight the beast.

@Boss 
%Byleth,Wild Demonic Beast
Wild Demonic Beast: Graaargh!
Sothis: This thing... It has no will or mind to call its own. You must now strike it down! That is the best you can hope to offer this poor, lost soul.
Byleth: ...

%Claude,Wild Demonic Beast
Claude: Do you think it was once a human, like Miklan? No... It's not possible...

%Flayn,Wild Demonic Beast
Flayn: Let us put an end to its suffering. I think that is the most honorable thing we can do at this point.

@End 
Sothis: Our work is done? My, my... Things did not go as planned. Let us return, before any more hawks or wolves join us. But what was that Demonic Beast doing within the Red Canyon...

Edelgard: I'm glad you are safe, Professor. It was rather reckless of you to venture out alone like that.
Hubert: I suppose we came out here without permission too. If we all wish to avoid punishment... Perhaps we can all agree that we came out here for an extra-curricular activity. Let's leave it at that.
Edelgard: Still, I would like to know what brought you to this valley in the first place...

Dimitri: Professor, I am so glad that you are unharmed. What if something had happened to you?
Dedue: Your Highness, our instructor is safe. We should return to the monastery at once.
Dimitri: Yes, I suppose you are right. If we stay here much longer, we are sure to be reprimanded.
Dedue: It is not untrue to assert that our professor led us here for battle experience...
Dimitri: Dedue, you surprise me! And you, Professor. I hope you will tell us what brought you here...

Claude: Listen, Teach. No one likes aimless wandering more than me, but it's not worth dying over.
Hilda: Well, we're all OK now, so let's just focus on the positive. Ooh, maybe we can tell folks back at the monastery that we came here for battle training? With our dear professor's permission?
Claude: Hilda, you scamp! No one has a knack for getting out of trouble quite like you do. It is a gift, milady.
Hilda: Oh, is that right? Well, no one can get into trouble quite like you, so it works out!

Sothis: Oh dear... I put us in a bit of danger there! We are most fortunate that those delinquents followed us... You very nearly met your end! What a marvelous professor you must be, for all your students to be so concerned.
Byleth: I'm proud of us. 
Sothis: Hmm, you seem more confident in your ability to teach. But that makes sense, as you have me to help you out.
Byleth: I'm not used to it yet.
Sothis: You are not used to it? Hm. You must start thinking of yourself as a professor here. Be confident, as you have me to help you out.
Sothis: How disappointing to have dived so deep into danger, and yet to have nothing to show. Huh? What is this...strange feeling... My memories... Do you feel them stirring? How curious. You seem to have grown stronger! And all thanks to our journey to Zanado. It really was worth all that effort!
Byleth: I found something...
Sothis: Huh? You found this? I daresay you may find a use for that. You should decide how best to use that thing. But wow! We got a lot out of this trip. It was a bother for a spell, but in the end, I feel we should think fondly of our little trip. We actually had a delightful time, wouldn't you say? 
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Interested in learning more about the legend of Macuil, one of the Four Saints, Claude ventures out across the territory of Margrave Edmund to the Sreng Region.

@Intro 
Claude: Hm...

Claude: Very interesting...
Byleth: What's interesting?
Byleth: What are you reading?
Claude: Oh, Teach! How long have you been there? Don't sneak up on me like that! You almost gave me a heart attack. Anyway, I'm reading the official biography of the Four Saints, as sanctioned by the church. I know you're not very familiar with the teachings of Seiros, but even you must have read it at least once.
Byleth: Maybe...
Claude: Huh. I'm amazed you managed to get a job teaching at an academy run by the church.
Byleth: I don't think so...
Claude: Tell me again... How exactly did you manage to get a job teaching at an academy run by the church?
Claude: Well, whether you've read the biography or not, the Four Saints must at least ring a bell, right?

Claude: Well then, I've got a little quiz for you. Name the Four Saints, companions of the great Saint Seiros. I'll give you a hint. There was Cichol, Cethleann, Indech, and... who was the fourth one again?
Byleth: Macile.
Claude: Ooh, tough luck! That would be incorrect. The name you were looking for is Macuil.
Byleth: Macuil.
Claude: Correct! I was hoping you'd know that much at least.
Byleth: Maicul.
Claude: Ooh, tough luck! That would be incorrect. The name you were looking for is Macuil.
Claude: In any case, you can learn some interesting things reading about the life and times of Saint Macuil. For instance, he was more skilled with his hands than his fellow saints, and even became an accomplished blacksmith. He used his skills to forge countless sacred weapons for the army of Seiros. Of course, he didn't just forge weapons. He also used them in battle himself. Legends say his strength was second only to Seiros. It's even said that he played a big role in the Battle of Tailtean, where Seiros fought Nemesis, the King of Liberation who became the king of evil. Macuil lost his life in that battle, and now his body rests in a coffin within the Holy Mausoleum. Or so one story goes. Another legend says he set off on a journey to find a new land. That he left FÃ³dlan from the east, crossed the sea, and vanished. He must have left Alliance territory, but where exactly would he have set sail from, I wonder? Thinking about it reminds me of another interesting story concerning the Sreng Region. The peninsula is attached to the mainland of FÃ³dlan and extends from the northeastern part of Kingdom territory. If you would set sail from Margrave Edmund's territory, you could cut cross a stretch of sea and land there. And it just so happens that in the Sreng Region, there are ruins built to worship a sacred beast that appeared from across the sea. If the ruins have something to do with Saint Macuil, there could be sacred weapons there... So? Have I piqued your interest or what?
Byleth: Maybe a little.
Byleth: Not really.
Claude: You always have to play it cool, don't you? Just think of how useful it would be to have weapons like that! Not to mention that the peninsula would be pretty easy to get to about now, seeing as how Alliance territory has settled down a bit. We'd be there and back in no time. No one would even notice we were gone. Come on, Teach! Let's go to the Sreng Region!
Byleth: Let's go. 
Claude: I always see it through once I set my mind on something. Let's make the necessary preparations before I die of curiosity.
Byleth: Let me think about it. 
Claude: I guess I can wait...just a while. But make sure you decide before I die of curiosity, OK?

@Battle 
Claude: There are the ruins... It looks like we're not gonna have the luxury of an excavation. Look. I bet those are the watchmen of the ruins, and that they've been ordered to keep out intruders. And that big beast... I hear they call it The Wind Caller.
The Wind Caller: Thieves... Only by defeating me can you claim the secret treasure!
Claude: Argh! It speaks! What is it?!

Thief: Huh? Who are you? I'm just here for a bit of treasure! Don't attack me!
Claude: Someone got here first... Must be a band of looters. We can't let them get the treasure! Guess their luck's about to run out.

Thief: You're not trying to take this treasure from me, are you?

Thief: The treasure... I thought it would make me rich...


Thief: If I don't get this treasure back, the boss is gonna be really angry with me!

Thief: I should never have become a thief...


Thief: After all the trouble we went through to get this treasure, I'm not gonna let you get your hands on it!

Thief: Gah... Those thieves...


Thief Leader: Huh? Are you looting too? Well, I'm not letting you have this treasure!

Thief Leader: No! That's my treasure...

@Boss 
The Wind Caller: You have had your fun. If you are going to flee, now is your chance. If you are not going to flee... I shall take your life as payment!

%Byleth,The Wind Caller
The Wind Caller: Hmmm... Those who stand before me... How long has it been? Hundreds of years? Thousands? You have the stink of Sothis upon you... Let us find out whether you share her power.

%Claude,The Wind Caller
The Wind Caller: I smell those detestable 10 Elites... Who are you?
Claude: I'm the grandson of the grandson of the grandson of the elite Riegan. Now tell me who you are!
The Wind Caller: I am your family's enemy. If you carry the blood of the 10 Elites, you cannot be permitted to live.
Claude: What do you mean by that? And what's that Crest on your forehead?
The Wind Caller: No more talk. If you wish to survive, you must destroy me!

%Flayn,The Wind Caller
The Wind Caller: Ah, that face takes me back in time... You have not changed one bit, Ceth-
Flayn: I ask that you keep quiet, Uncle!
The Wind Caller: Why the rush, Ceth-
Flayn: Shh! Please keep quiet, Uncle!

%Seteth,The Wind Caller
The Wind Caller: Are these your companions?
Seteth: They are indeed. I should tell you that Seiros is in a precarious state right now.
The Wind Caller: I will not assist you. I have lived apart from the world of man, which disgusts me so. This war disgusts me also.
Seteth: I thought you might say as much. This is regrettable.

@End 
The Wind Caller: ...
Claude: It stopped moving... It is dead?
The Wind Caller: Zzz...
Claude: No... It seems it's just sleeping... I thought we were supposed to be given the treasure, but... Forget it. I'll just have a look around there. What about this thing? Huh. I'll think about it later.

Claude: Thanks for all your hard work, Teach. Sorry for dragging you along with me. I had no idea it would turn into a fight. But hey, at least we got some treasure out of it. I'll leave this in your capable hands. Do with it as you will.
Byleth: Why me?
Claude: You know our friends even better than I do.
Byleth: Why don't we share it?
Claude: How would we do that?
Claude: Give it to whoever you think it'll suit best. More importantly, I didn't go there looking for treasure. Not really. Legends about the saints abound. It's hard to tell fact from fiction. I like to confirm whatever I can, with my own eyes, to find the truth in those legends.
Byleth: What did you find out?
Claude: Not a thing. We didn't find anything concrete to prove that Saint Macuil had been there. We can't say for certain that the treasure we found was Macuil's either. I do wish we could have spoken to that Wind Caller a bit more.
Byleth: Could it have been Saint Macuil?
Claude: Ha! Unlikely. Macuil lived thousands of years ago. And I've never heard anything about the saints being monsters like that. Wait a minute... Could the Wind Caller have anything to do with the Immaculate One? The Immaculate One is a monster sent by the goddess... Could the Wind Caller be... Where was it that I heard that stuff about them having been sent by the goddess... Ugh, maybe I'm too tired. My head is heavy and I can't think straight anymore. Let's call it a day for now. I've got plenty of time to think this over.

@Opening 
Hubert reveals some of his thoughts about the mysterious power aiding the Empire with strange technology. As fate would have it, a visitor chooses that moment to arrive...

@Intro 
Hubert: Professor. You're here.
Byleth: Did you send for me?
Hubert: No. But while you are here, you may as well listen. I am sure you recall hearing about Kronya, Solon, and Lord Arundel. I am investigating their true identities. I want to know their origins. Their numbers. Their base of operations. Their plans. I want to know where they acquired their dark powers. How they disguise themselves. Many intriguing mysteries surround these people. Wouldn't you agree?
Byleth: Yes.
Hubert: I have a name for them.
Byleth: Not really.
Hubert: No? I suppose someone of your statue has more immediately pressing concerns. Well, I have a name for them.
Hubert: Those who slither in the dark...

Imperial Soldier: Lord Hubert! Pardon me, but Lord Arundel is at the monastery. He says he wants to discuss something with you and is waiting in the reception hall.
Hubert: Speaking of... Professor, would you come along?



Lord Arundel: Hubert. I have something I must request of you.
Hubert: Request? That is an unusual word choice. A request, by definition, can be refused. But if you have orders, Regent, I will follow them.
Lord Arundel: Heh. Such a reaction before you even hear me out. Very well. One of my subordinates was conducting experiments in the Sealed Forest. The Demonic Beast he was using ran wild and has created something of a...situation. Take care of it.
Hubert: Experiments, you say? Heh...very well. I will set out at once.  Professor, will you assist?
Byleth: Yes. 
Hubert: Thank you for your support. It is a great help.
Byleth: Now is not a good time. 
Hubert: I understand. I will call upon those who are able to move immediately. Let me know if you change your mind. It will take some time to prepare.

@Battle 
Hubert: My, my. Looks like this forest became infested with Demonic Beasts while we weren't looking. I suppose we've not a moment to lose. Not that I'm concerned for any of these...people. But since there may be a reward in it for us, we may as well do what we can to rescue them.

Hubert: Now then. Let's split up and move in to assist. It may be worth focusing your attention on those being targeted by multiple Demonic Beasts.

@End 
Mysterious Mage 1: What a disgrace to be saved by those fools...
Mysterious Mage 2: Enough. These certainly proved useful. Go ahead and take them.
Hubert: Your tools, I gather? Yes, I suppose we will take them off your hands since you asked so nicely.

Lord Arundel: I'm surprised at you, Hubert. Saving all of my poor subordinates...

Lord Arundel: Hmph. Casualties. You were not as helpful as I had thought you would be.
Byleth: I'm sorry.
Byleth: We did the best we could.
Lord Arundel: I am not criticizing you. This failure is my own for thinking you were capable of more.
Lord Arundel: It seems gratitude is in order. Let us meet again soon.

Hubert: Good riddance. What a nuisance that man is. He and his ilk must be aware of my investigation. No doubt this was all an attempt to make us believe we are powerless against them. It has only achieved the opposite effect.
Byleth: How so?
Hubert: They are looking down on us. They think we cannot touch them. But the closer we get to them, the less true that becomes. Just look at this weaponry we received as a token of their appreciation. It would be impossible for us to manufacture such a piece with our current tools and knowledge. It is not as powerful as a Relic, but it is nearly so. We will keep them close, for now, while we still need their strength to rule FÃ³dlan. Once FÃ³dlan is united, however, the focus of this war will shift. Rather than swords clashing on the battlefield, it will be knives cutting in the darkness. Lady Edelgard's war will be over, and House Vestra's will begin. We who rule the shadows will eradicate those who slither in the dark. When that time comes, Professor, you will be quite useful to us.

@Opening 
Amid riots in Hrym territory, Ferdinand learns that his missing father, Duke Aegir, has been found. Lysithea, who knows the area well, goes with him to investigate.

@Intro 
Duke Aegir: Can't...stop...running...

Duke Aegir: Wha--?!

Rogue A: We got you! You're the prime minister, aren't you?
Rogue B: Not anymore. He lost his power and his fancy title. Now he's just a man.
Duke Aegir: I...
Rogue C: Shut up!
Rogue A: Yeah! Do you know what you've done to regular folks like us? Since you villains took over the Hrym territory, our lives have been nothing but pain and misery! Heavy taxes, forced labor. It's brutal!
Rogue D: Now we're gonna make you pay!
Duke Aegir: Agh! Argh! Aaaaaaaargh!



Ferdinand: Hm, such a nice selection of tea leaves in the pantry here.
Lysithea: Tea is nice and all, but it's not much good when you don't have sweets to go with it.
Ferdinand: Sweet treats are less common, yes, but perhaps that makes sense. War is not sugar-coated.
Lysithea: If you've got time to be cheeky, you've got time to find me some sweets.
Ferdinand: But Lysithea, your smile is so sweet--

Knight of Seiros: Lord Ferdinand! Excuse the interruption. Our scouts happened upon the information you were looking for. I thought it would be best to let you know as soon as possible.
Ferdinand: They know where my father is?!
Knight of Seiros: Yes, sir.
Ferdinand: Tell me, now.
Knight of Seiros: After losing his position as prime minister, your father was held in Enbarr for a very long time. He escaped. For a while, no one knew where he was. The other day, however, he was sighted alone in the Hrym territory. Seemed he was heading for an allied region.
Lysithea: Hrym...
Ferdinand: Alone, you say. Was he safe?
Knight of Seiros: I'm afraid not... There is a major insurrection happening in the Hrym territory. It's been five years since Duke Aegir lost his control of the area... The military seems to have finally lost control, and the people's violence is unleashed.
Ferdinand: I do not understand. Why are they rioting?
Lysithea: It's obvious, isn't it? Ferdinand, do you really know nothing about Hrym? Your own father was ruling it -- you don't know what became of the area once he fell from power?
Ferdinand: If it was truly a House Aegir territory, I would have been trained in governing the area. But my father insisted that I have nothing to do with Hrym. But now is not the time to talk about this. We have to help him before he gets caught up in the violence.
Lysithea: You're right. Now isn't the time for chitchat. Let's get over there quickly. Professor, will you be coming?
Byleth: I'll go with you. 
Lysithea: We'd better depart as soon as possible. I know a bit about the situation. I'll fill you in later.
Byleth: I want you to wait. 
Ferdinand: I understand. If you cannot help us, the Knights of Seiros will, so it is not a problem.
Lysithea: Professor, time is of the essence. If you're going to come with us, prepare as quickly as you can.

@Battle 
Ferdinand: This is where my father was sighted? The citizens are rioting everywhere.
Lysithea: Over there! Quick -- we need to help them!
Ferdinand: There seem to be some people inciting the violence. If we take them out, perhaps the violence will subside.
Lysithea: It might be best to spread out...

Ferdinand: The north side of the town is in chaos. I do not think we can advance.
Lysithea: It seems better to simply hold the line against the enemies to the north, and focus our efforts on saving the citizens in the east and south.

Villager: Th-thank you! Looks like I won't be robbed this time!

Villager: Thank you ever so much for helping us! I don't know what would have happened if it weren't for you...

Villager: We owe you our lives! We're saved! Saved, I say!

Villager: I get to live another day, and it's all because you came to the rescue!
Lysithea: I think that's all of them. I'm so glad we were able to help everyone.

Rogue: All right! Let's ransack this place!
Lysithea: Ugh, we weren't fast enough! But there's still time to save the others. Hurry!

Rogue: Oh yeah, keep going! Hahaha!
Ferdinand: They got past us...again. We have to save the next one!

Rogue: I'll take whatever I want, and there ain't nothing you can do to stop me!
Lysithea: Ugh, they ransacked another house! But there may be others yet who need our help.

Rogue: All right, boys! Smash and grab whatever's left!
Ferdinand: We could not save anyone?! It infuriates me to feel so helpless...

Rogue: Oh, looky there, some houses are still untouched! Let's give 'em a good plundering, boys!
Lysithea: Professor, let's make haste and go help them! Their lives may be forfeit if we don't get to them quickly.

Rogue Grappler:  Hyaah! Go on, boys! Riot to your heart's content!
Rogue Grappler:  Argh! I'm not the only...bad guy here...
Rogue Thief: What?! W-we give up! Have mercy! That guy made us do it!

Rogue Swordmaster:  Hahaha! If we cause enough chaos, we can do whatever we want!
Rogue Swordmaster:  My ambition...unfulfilled...
Rogue Thief: We yield! Yield! We were just following orders! It's not like we love a good riot, really!

Rogue Sniper:  What do you want?! You'd better not stand in our way!
Rogue Sniper:  And after I went to all the trouble of killing that noble and stealing his treasure...
Ferdinand: Father, no! So, we were too late after all...

@End 
Lysithea: Ferdinand... Hey.
Ferdinand: Yes?
Lysithea: I... I don't know what to say. About your father, I mean.
Ferdinand: No, it is all right. Some part of me was expecting this. I do not know what happened in Hrym territory, but I'm sure he got what he deserved. You knew more about it, you said? Maybe you can tell me everything later.

Lysithea: I can tell you what I know.
Ferdinand: Please do.
Lysithea: You know about the Hrym rebellion, right?
Ferdinand: Of course. The rebellion started when Emperor Ionius IX tried to consolidate power. The Hrym family tried to split off from the Empire and join the Alliance. Working with House Ordelia, they raised an insurrection. The Empire suppressed it. And then a puppet leader was installed in the Hrym territory. House Aegir was tasked with handling the actual governance of the region. Seeing this, the nobles feared that the Empire would assume total control. That's when the six great noble families chose to wrest power from Ionius IX.
Lysithea: That's right. The Insurrection of the Seven. I've always wondered why it was called seven when there were only six noble families.
Ferdinand: It was the six great noble families, plus Hrym.
Lysithea: How vexing. Either way, events unfolded shortly thereafter. Are you aware of how Duke Aegir was ruling the Hrym territory? He imposed harsh taxes upon the people -- much harsher than on his own -- making their lives very challenging. People fled their homes in droves to the neighboring Ordelia territory. But they were sent back from where they came. The Empire was occupying Ordelia territory as well, as it turned out. Issues were further complicated when Duke Aegir fell from power. Aegir was dismissed from his position, only to be replaced by Lord Arundel.
Ferdinand: Edelgard's uncle, the regent of the Empire...
Lysithea: Correct. And he imposed even heavier taxes on the people, squeezing them painfully dry. The people were conscripted for duty. Any who opposed were killed on the spot. Lord Arundel did this in the name of Duke Aegir.
Ferdinand: What?!
Lysithea: Your father was by no means a great ruler. But it was Lord Arundel who stoked the fury of the people and directed that fury at your father. Duke Aegir is not perfect, but he's not the villain in this.
Ferdinand: Lysithea, thank you for telling me all this. I am embarrassed to say, I had no idea. I see now that it was not his fault. But he did go along the wrong path, and place a burden on his people. He can no longer atone for what he did, so I will have to. I need to go think about what I will do after the war. How I will make up for my father's mistakes.
Lysithea: Nothing helps deep thought like sweets.
Ferdinand: Hm?
Lysithea: Sweets. They help you think. Perhaps you should find some for us.
Ferdinand: I see. If I find some, I will be sure to let you know.

Sylvain is unable to stand idly by when he learns that the band of thieves once led by his brother, Miklan, are again causing trouble in Margrave Gautier's territory.

@Intro 
Sylvain: Hey, Professor. You're looking lovely as ever.
Sylvain: Are you working today? You gotta take a day sometime. Get out in the world and have some fun.
Byleth: That's not a bad idea.
Sylvain: Right? Sometimes you gotta forget all the things you oughta do and focus on what you'd rather do. Hey, we should go get something to eat. My treat.
Byleth: I could never...
Sylvain: Aw, come on, Professor. Let me buy you something to eat. Relax for a couple hours at least.
Byleth: No, thank you.
Sylvain: Ah, fine. You're missing out though.
Byleth: What are you after?
Sylvain: What? I can't invite my professor to dinner without it being a scam? Heh! I...ah...OK, fine. You got me.
Sylvain: I need to ask a favor, and I wanted a way to work up the courage to ask you.
Byleth: Ask me what?
Byleth: Is this about a girl?
Sylvain: No, for once it's not about a girl.
Sylvain: There are thieves in my father's territory. I was wondering if you'd go with me to drive 'em off. You remember the thief leader you fought at Conand Tower, yeah?
Byleth: Your brother?
Sylvain: Yes, Miklan. He was the oldest son of House Gautier.
Byleth: Miklan?
Sylvain: That's right. Although he's dead now...

Byleth: Yes, that's crazy.
Sylvain: The way my father is...he probably has some other motive that I'll never know.
Byleth: Why just you?
Sylvain: Because he thinks he'd lose face asking the church for help. I don't know. He could have asked another trusted house to send troops, but he only asked me. And the way my father is...he probably has some other motive that I'll never know.
Sylvain: Maybe he just wants me to get some more experience in battle. Crazy way to suggest it though. Anyway, I'm not going alone, no matter what he asks. I'm going to ask some of the others in our class to help too. But none of us have your expertise. If you'd come with us, I'd be grateful.
Byleth: Of course. 
Sylvain: Great! I'll talk to the others and see who's in. Thanks, Professor!
Byleth: I can't right now. 
Sylvain: OK. I understand. I did kind of just drop that question on you, huh? If you change your mind though, let me know. I'll be around for a bit.

@Battle 
Sylvain: OK, we've got the thieves covered on both sides. Some of the thieves are still carrying what they stole, so we have a chance to get it back. Gotta be careful, though. They'll run off faster than a nobleman's daughter if we just rush in. Target the strongholds to cut off their escape routes.

Sylvain: My father's offering a reward for every thief and rogue we take out. The more you beat, the more you get. Just remember, you gotta take them down fast. They'll bolt as soon as they're hurt. Take the strongholds and we cut off their escape route.



Sylvain: OK, that'll do it. This exit route is blocked off. Very good. Now, let's keep cool and take out the other strongholds.

Sylvain: That's one more stronghold taken and one more escape route blocked. There are still some strongholds left. Professor, which should we go for first?

Sylvain: Another escape route blocked. We're nearly done! Take out those thieves, and capture that last stronghold.

Thief: We've been rattled... Let's get out of here for now.
Sylvain: Ugh, they're getting away! If only we'd taken the stronghold out in time.

Thief: I guess we've pinched enough stuff here. That'll keep our bellies stuffed for a while!
Sylvain: Professor, are you letting them get away? Come on, we gotta block off their escape routes!

@Boss 
Thief Leader: Gah... I'm not sticking round here to get slaughtered by a bunch of stuck up jerks like you!

%Sylvain,Thief Leader
Thief Leader: Hey, I know that face. You're the boss's little bro, right?
Sylvain: I'm sorry to say it, but yeah, I'm his brother. And he's led you into a bad spot. Anyway, your boss is dead. So this is your chance to disband this little thief gang of yours.
Thief Leader: Quiet, fool! You think I have any other choice but to be a thief?
Sylvain: Well, it's probably on me for making such a stupid request.

@End 
Sylvain: Professor, thank you for your help. We drove off the thieves and got a reward from my father. Job well done, eh? Although, I don't know how to feel about this particular reward.

Sylvain: I guess that's why my father tasked me with this particular mission. He wanted me to prove myself worthy of this Relic. This weapon, the Lance of Ruin... It killed my brother, and now it's mine.
Byleth: Isn't that dangerous?
Syvlain: Not remotely. I bear the Crest of Gautier. The same Crest my brother wished for his whole life but never came to possess.
Byleth: You're still thinking about your brother, aren't you?
Sylvain: I suppose I am... Miklan hated me from the moment he found out I had a Crest and he didn't. He was selfish and egotistical. I know it's not right to say bad things about the dead, but he earned it. Even now, I'm still cleaning up his messes. I have to wonder though... What if it was the other way around? If he had the Crest and I didn't... Would I be the one my father thought was worth forgetting? Or would my fate have been wholly unlike his?
Byleth: Thinking like that won't get you anywhere.
Sylvain: You're probably right, Professor. It's not like me, is it? I don't pray much...but I think I'm going to pray for those who lost their lives to the thieves tonight. And for all of us. I'm afraid there are more days like this coming our way.
Byleth: Why do you say that?
Sylvain: Faerghus has always been a cold place. Never very well-to-do. Until about 10 years ago, our region was a battlefield for the people of the Sreng Region to the north. And after the late king fell, the whole Kingdom became unstable. So it's no real surprise that more and more people are resorting to thievery just to survive. And there are those rumors of the current regent being too busy chasing the ladies to bother with governing. Don't worry, I get the irony. The whole damn Kingdom is in decline because of nonsense like that. I'm hoping once we get Dimitri on the throne everything will get better. Anyway, I'll leave it up to you to decide how you want to use our reward. Including the Lance of Ruin. I know I can trust you with it until you think I'm ready. And, Professor, if I could, I'd still like to buy you a meal sometime.
Byleth: There's no need.
Sylvain: Or do you really just hate the idea of having dinner with me? Just kidding! I know you're busy.
Byleth: You have another favor to ask?
Sylvain: No, I'm just asking a friend to hang out, that's all.
Sylvain: Again though, thank you for everything, Professor. I couldn't have done it alone.

@Opening 
As Edelgard works to reorganize the army after merging with Alliance troops, she receives an urgent message from Duke Goneril, whose forces guard FÃ³dlan's Locket.

@Intro 
Edelgard: There... We must rethink the supply route now that the battle lines have moved. This one will be Hubert...and Count Bergliez will oversee this force here...

Edelgard: Ah, Professor... Is something wrong? Sorry, I thought I had a bit more time before the council meeting.
Byleth: You never stop working.
Edelgard: True. Though ideally, I'd like to hand off anything I can to my subordinates. But while we're on the front lines, I can't help but worry about every little thing.
Byleth: Sorry to bother you.
Edelgard: No bother at all, but I'm afraid I'm not quite finished here. Still, I'm happy to see you. Your presence lightens my mood a great deal.
Edelgard: Now, let's see...

Hubert: Pardon, Your Majesty. An urgent matter.
Edelgard: What's happened?
Hubert: There is an army from Almyra at FÃ³dlan's Throat. Reports indicate it is of appreciable size.
Byleth: FÃ³dlan's Throat?
Hubert: A steep mountain range runs along the border between FÃ³dlan and Almyra. That mountain range is called FÃ³dlan's Throat. The sturdy fortress built within those mountains is called FÃ³dlan's Locket. It occupies the sole path through. The church and the Alliance nobles built the Locket to safeguard against Almyran invasion.
Edelgard: Normally, House Goneril watches over the fortress. In times of trouble, the lords join together to protect it. But I assume it would be too difficult to defend against this incursion with only the troops of Goneril...
Hubert: The situation has been precarious for House Goneril since Holst fell ill.
Byleth: Holst?
Hubert: The heir to House Goneril, renowned for his bravery. He is Hilda's elder brother.
Byleth: I see.
Edelgard: Holst is a formidable commander. it is only logical that House Goneril would struggle in his absence. The Alliance has shattered. They can't request soldiers from the surrounding lords. And the Imperial troops stationed there can't be relocated so easily. The best course of action is for us to go out there and deal with this ourselves. It's critical for us to protect that location. This is our chance to prove that we won't allow it to fall.
Hubert: Yes. It is to the benefit of our future governance not to abandon it. It seems this must be done. Will you assist us?
Byleth: I will. 
Edelgard: We'll depart after you finish making preparations. Move swiftly. We must move before the Almyran army crosses the Throat.
Byleth: Let me think. 
Edelgard: Yes... Preparations must still be made. We'll wait a bit longer. If you're not going to join us, we'll take those who are able and willing. Don't worry about it.

@Battle 
Edelgard: It seems we made it in time. Let's help the soldiers of House Goneril withdraw. The Black Eagle Strike Force will protect FÃ³dlan's Locket!
Goneril Soldier: Support! We're saved!
Nader: Reinforcements? And that flag belongs to the Imperial army... Ha! A fine enemy, indeed! Break through the Locket and make a name for yourself! No need to by shy--strike all at once!

Edelgard: We fight to protect FÃ³dlan! If the defensive line is broken, we fail! Our enemies are many...but we can use the terrain to our advantage and stop them where they stand!

@Boss 
Nader: I must commend you for your courage, seeing as how you dare stand against me!

%Byleth,Nader
Nader: Your sword is fit to cleave a mountain in two. Care to try it out against the undefeated Nader?

%Edelgard,Nader
Edelgard: They call you undefeated... Oh, but you've already suffered one defeat, have you not? And on this day, victory will again be ours!
Nader: "The Once Defeated" isn't quite as exciting, is it? I'll just have to claim this victory here to wipe away the shame of defeat!

@End 
Nader: So this is how far I go... Unbelievable... What a scary woman...
Edelgard: No matter how many times you attack, we will never allow you to capture the Throat.

Edelgard: The Almyran troops are difficult opponents... For now, I would much rather focus on FÃ³dlan's internal territories. I hope they don't mount another attack anytime soon.

Edelgard: The Almyran Army retreated. Their casualties were numerous. As I understand it, they won't be attempting another invasion anytime soon. Still, we must prepare the local troops before their enemy returns.
Byleth: They are an irritating neighbor.
Edelgard: Indeed. But if possible, I would like to foster amicable relations with them.
Byleth: Maybe we can befriend them?
Edelgard: That is my hope. I would even consider a treaty.
Edelgard: Unlike FÃ³dlan, Almyra is not a land ruled by a blind fealty to the goddess. I believe we need only to communicate openly with them and respect the differences between our cultures. If we do that, we should be able to have an meaningful dialogue with them, one more promising than what we can expect from followers of the goddess.

Edelgard: Ah, Hubert. What did Duke Goneril say?
Hubert: He expresses his sincere gratitude to Lady Edelgard. In addition, he would like to leave the protection of the Throat to Imperial troops from now on.
Edelgard: Is that so? How reasonable of him. By the way, what was it that ailed Holst?
Hubert: I did not hear all the details, but apparently he ate some bad mushrooms. It is said he is now emaciated and pale, and his skin exudes a mysterious vapor.
Edelgard: Huh, I can't help but imagine what that must look like...but it's probably better not to think about it.
Hubert: Agreed. Do not worry yourself with such thoughts.
Edelgard: ...
Byleth: I'm too curious.
Edelgard: Indeed... Well, then maybe you should pay a visit. And then...you could tell me what it looked like.
Byleth: It's best left unseen.
Edelgard: There's only one option, then. I must pay a visit on my own and see this ailment with my own eyes.
Hubert: Heh...
Edelgard: Actually... On second thought, I'd better not. As emperor, I can't risk it.

@Opening 
The war in FÃ³dlan has put Brigid in a precarious position. With Bernadetta in tow, Petra returns to her homeland in hopes of avoiding a confrontation with her grandfather.

@Intro 
Bernadetta: Ah, nothing like a moment of perfect stillness...
Petra: Why is it preferable to have stillness?
Bernadetta: Ah! Petra? Please don't sneak up on me like that! Oh... You're here too, Professor? What's going on?
Petra: I was asking my question first. What are you enjoying about air that is still?
Bernadetta: Um. Still air makes me feel better, that's all. It means you're in a nice, closed-off space where you can hide.
Petra: But spaces that are wide and open are wonderful. Places like forests and oceans.
Bernadetta: Guess we'll have to agree to disagree about that.
Petra: I am not understanding your answer, but I am appreciating your explanation. I am reminded. I was wanting to ask if you wish to go to the forest or ocean with me?
Bernadetta: Um. What? What part of anything I said would make you think I wanted that?

Bernadetta: So your grandfather is in trouble. He's trying to lend us soldiers from Brigid, but... Edelgard is sending messengers there to convince Brigid she's not their enemy.
Petra: You are saying messengers, but the truth is they are a threat. Brigid is having no power to refuse.
Bernadetta: I get it, but what does this have to do with me?
Petra: Professor was asking this of me. I was told...if I am going to a far away place, to be taking Bernie with me, since she is hiding away.
Bernadetta: What?! Professor! What did I do to deserve this?! I know I'm a recluse, but I do go out on missions once in a while!
Byleth: You can't refuse.
Bernadetta: Tyranny! Abuse of power! I have rights!
Byleth: Lend me your strength. 
Bernadetta: You say that, but I don't think I'm ready for this.
Petra: Bernie, I am wanting this as well. Please join me.
Bernadetta: Since you put it that way, Petra...I'll think about it. Do you really want me to go, Professor?
Byleth: I do. 
Bernadetta: All right. I'll lend a hand...for everyone's sake!
Petra: What is the point of lending a hand? Are you not needing both of them to battle?
Bernadetta: What?! No, it's a figure of speech! Oh, don't make me imagine that!
Byleth: I'm not sure. 
Petra: Maybe we are not needing you then. I will try borrowing the power of the church.
Bernadetta: Um, OK... I don't mind shutting myself in like usual. But I can't say I feel good about all this!
Petra:  If your mind is changing, please tell me. I will be waiting as long as I can.

@Battle 
Bernadetta: Professor, this is bad! The enemy's already here!
Petra: In strength, the enemies may be winning, but I am having an idea... I have been hearing that my friends are being imprisoned in the western stronghold... We will be taking the stronghold and releasing our allies! Do not let loose your hope.
Bernadetta: Wh-what? That side's crawling with enemies! We should go east! Way fewer of them over there...

Imperial Soldier: What's this?! You there! Identify yourselves!
Bernadetta: Ah! They're here. I'm not the one you want. I'm innocent!

Petra: The capturing of the stronghold has been completed. Our friends from the stronghold will soon be aiding us in battle...

Hubert: Well, well, well. This little diplomatic errand to Brigid just got interesting. It seems we have some special guests. Capture the road ahead before they reach it.

Petra: If they are blocking the road, I will not have the ability to be seeing my grandfather! I must be moving quickly!

Catherine: I came here to tell the people of Brigid not to join forces with our enemies. Looks like the Empire had the same idea. Let's block the road and cut them off!

@Boss 
Hubert: Brigid is a vassal of the Empire. You will not turn them against us!

Catherine: Brigid will not become a puppet of the Empire. The Knights of Seiros won't let it happen!

Catherine: I can't achieve anything more here. Keep fighting! Stop them!

%Petra,Hubert
Hubert: So, Princess of Brigid. Now we see where your loyalties truly lie. This, after we spared your life in return for naught but your fealty. How ungrateful.
Petra: Ten years have been passed. The Empire has been changed, just as Brigid has!

%Bernadetta,Hubert
Bernadetta: Ah! They're here! Help me!
Hubert: Heheheh. Go on and scream, if it makes you feel better. But if you could die swiftly and without a struggle, I would greatly appreciate it.

%Bernadetta,Catherine
Bernadetta: Ah! It's Thunder Catherine! We're done for!
Catherine: Hey, I was going to say that! You didn't let me introduce myself. How rude. Thunderbrand and I will have to teach you some manners.

@End 
Hubert: Heh. No more I can do here. Troops, remember your orders. I must withdraw.

Petra: It is done! Now, I can be meeting my grandfather. We must be moving with haste!
Bernadetta: Finally over? Phew! All right, let's get out of here! This isn't exactly, um, the ideal environment for a recluse, you know.
Petra: I will be speaking with my grandfather. Once he is convinced, I will be returning. Professor, everyone, please be waiting here. Enemies may still be nearby.
Bernadetta: Got it. We'll wait right here. And if anyone comes, um, the professor will handle it. Right, Professor?

@Battle 
Petra: My life is endangered! I must keep alive!

Petra: Reinforcements are ready. Let us attack with each other!

Petra: Professor... Please, convey to my grandfather... that... I am without regret...
Bernadetta: Petra!? Petra no! Don't leave us!

Petra: Grandfather, I cannot be meeting you... My objective was failed.

@End 
Petra: It is done. Now, I can be meeting my grandfather. We must be moving with haste!
Bernadetta: Finally over? Phew! All right, let's get out of here! This isn't exactly, um, the ideal environment for a recluse, you know.
Petra: I will be speaking with my grandfather. Once he is convinced, I will be returning. Professor, everyone, please be waiting here. Enemies may still be nearby.
Bernadetta: Got it. We'll wait right here. And if anyone comes, um, the professor will handle it! Right, Professor?

Bernadetta: The vegetation around here's pretty different from the kinds we usually see. It may be no good for a recluse, but the forest does have its own charms, doesn't it?
Byleth: I'm surprised to hear you say that.
Bernadetta: Didn't you know? I love greenery! Especially carnivorous plants. They're my favorite.
Byleth: You like plants?
Bernadetta: Sure do! Especially the carnivorous ones.
Byleth: Carnivorous plants...
Bernadetta: Yes! They just sit there, nice and still, and wait for their dinner to come to them! How great is that? And they all look so unique too!
Byleth: ...
Bernadetta: What? Don't you think so? Oh, look! Petra's back!
Petra: Sorry to be making you wait. I have spoken with him.
Bernadetta: It's been a long time since you've seen your grandfather, huh? How'd it go?
Petra: As is usual, my grandfather is well and strong. He was saying that he will be supporting us and giving us troops.
Bernadetta: That's great! So we did it?
Petra: We did. You have my thanks. Ever since we were losing the war to the Empire, Brigid has been viewed as a vassal state. But with FÃ³dlan at war...it is a chance for Brigid to be changing our situation. Our cooperation today is part of that chance. Brigid is wanting equality with FÃ³dlan. We will be working hard to make this happen.
Bernadetta: Ah...
Petra: Bernie? What is it you are feeling?
Bernadetta: You're amazing, Petra. You went all by yourself to a foreign country... You worked hard for your homeland, and you achieved your goal. I'm always focused on my own problems, and I barely ever get anywhere...
Petra: That is not the truth. You were fighting hard for me. You came here to be helping everyone. You were not thinking only of yourself. I am never doubting you were working hard. We will be working together to keep moving forward to the future.
Bernadetta: You...really mean it? That's so nice!
Petra: And you were telling me about your interest in foreign vegetation. That is one reason I wanted to be bringing you here. Did it make you happy?
Bernadetta: It did! It was really exciting! I've got so many drawings I need to do before we head back! I might even have enough to make it into a book! Yeah, I should do that! Want to help, Professor?

@Opening 
Lorenz receives a letter from his father, Count Gloucester, who wishes for his son to resolve a territorial dispute that is about to escalate to violence.

@Intro 
Lorenz: Ah, perfection. These tea leaves are just divine. Quite the impressive selection, if I do say so myself.

Cyril: Lorenz, so this is where ya are.
Lorenz: Hello, Cyril. Lured here by the exquisite aroma, were you?
Cyril: Uh...no? I've got a thing for ya. It's a letter. Alright. Well, don't say I didn't deliver it.

Lorenz: A letter for me, is it? Curious. Let's see what we have here.

Lorenz: ...

Byleth: So, who's it from?
Lorenz: Hello, Professor. It is a rare correspondence from my father, as it happens.
Byleth: Is that a love letter?
Lorenz: Alas, Professor, nothing so whimsical as that. This correspondence comes from my father.
Lorenz: Some difficulty with Acheron, apparently. My father wishes me to return home and settle it.
Byleth: Acheron?
Lorenz: A young lord whose domain borders my father's. Do you know of the Great Bridge of Myrddin? It is an old bridge across the Airmid River. A key crossing between Alliance and Empire territory. Acheron controls the land on the northern side. Controlling such an essential location gives him quite a bit of clout, which he is ever so eager to deploy toward the purpose of stirring up trouble. This time, he is dredging up an old border dispute that was supposed to be settled some time ago. He has even begun to dispatch military force. It is best we rout his troops before they cause any damage to the surrounding villages.
Byleth: Why does this fall to you, Lorenz?
Lorenz: To my father, Acheron is insignificant in the face of far more pressing political matters. Other houses wield far greater power and influence: Goneril, Ordelia, Edmund, and of course, Riegan. To make his voice heard at the roundtable conferences, my father must keep up relations with them. That is simply the way the Leicester Alliance works. It was, after all, founded with the goal of freedom from Faerghus. We prize that independence highly, even if it occasionally hinders cooperation. There is often talk of mutual aid, but the truth is that each noble acts to maximize personal benefit. At the moment, the Riegan Dukedom is in no state to keep those conflicting motivations in check. So while the Alliance may appear to be at peace, the reality is that internal conflict is a routine matter. Of course, this leaves me precious little time to sit back and enjoy a cup of tea. Alas, I must be off.
Byleth: Good luck.
Byleth: Sounds tough.
Lorenz: Since you are here, perhaps you would care to accompany me on this little errand? I have no fear of Acheron, but it could be valuable to experience these political nuances firsthand.
Lorenz: The fate of the Alliance will someday rest upon my shoulders, so it is important to me that those I deal with understand its workings. What say you to broadening your horizons?
Lorenz: It is important to me that those I deal with understand its workings. What say you to broadening your horizons?
Byleth: Let's go. 
Lorenz: Excellent! Let us be away at once. I shall leave the finer details of preparation in your capable hands.
Byleth: Another time. 
Lorenz: Of course. I understand you are quite busy, yourself. I cannot linger here forever, but please do come and speak with me again if you change your mind.

@Battle 
Lorenz: Far more enemies than I expected. I am glad you decided to come with us, Professor.
Acheron: Oh? And here I thought Count Gloucester would be too busy to send his soldiers here... Ah, well, it doesn't matter. I'll just have to deal with you little meddlers swiftly and decisively!
Lorenz: That is Acheron. If we can deal with him, that ought to scare the rest of these rats off. We need not actually kill him. So long as we cut his escape off convincingly enough, that should suffice. Incidentally, take note of those drawbridges. They can only be operated from one of the banks. We may be able to use that to our advantage.

Acheron: Ooh, have you found something nice? Go ahead and hand it over!
Lorenz: Thieves! Do not allow them to escape!

Lorenz: A thief has escaped!

Acheron: Looks like our boys gave them an artful slip!
Lorenz: I cannot believe we missed both of those dastards!

Lorenz: The enemy is on the move! Do not let them through!

Acheron: Well now, so you couldn't stop us after all!
Lorenz: Me, outmaneuvered by a rat?! Ugh. What a disgrace!

@Boss 
Acheron: Who are you? I'd appreciate it if you could just not get in my way!

%Lorenz,Acheron
Lorenz: Give it up, Acheron! We are in the right. If you try to remain here any longer...
Acheron: What, you'll kill me? A tiny kid like you kill someone like me? Oh, that's too funny.
Lorenz: An animal like you cannot be allowed to run amok. We will settle this here and now!
Acheron: If you think you're up to the task, then by all means. But it's not my fault if it ends badly for you.

%Claude,Acheron
Claude: I did hear that some good-for-nothing inherited this territory. I guess that's you, then.
Acheron: Who do you think you are? I'm not a good-for-nothing! You are!
Claude: If you were actually good for anything at all, I'd at least expect you to recognize who I am...

@End 
Acheron: Argh! Wait! I lose, I give up! I surrender! Please don't kill meeee!
Lorenz: ... You have my thanks, Professor. Please go on ahead. I will clean up here and then report to my father. See you back at the monastery.

Acheron: Now that's a stubborn defense... We should probably give up. Let's retreat!
Lorenz: So, they've withdrawn. What a pointless battle.

Lorenz: You have my thanks, professor. Please go on ahead. I will clean up here and then report to my father. See you back at the monastery.

Lorenz: Your assistance in this incident with Acheron has proved most essential. Consider me in your debt. Thanks to you, the Alliance was able to nip this internal conflict in the bud.
Byleth: What will become of Acheron?
Lorenz: He has written a pledge to my father, swearing never to cause trouble about the border again. Of course, he is hardly the type to bind himself in good faith to anything written on paper. But Acheron has many connections, both in the Alliance and in the Empire. To remove him entirely would cause more conflict. We will just have to watch him closely for now.
Byleth: That sounds like a cautious approach.
Byleth: That is a prudent decision.
Lorenz: Indeed. I do plan to eliminate him eventually, however. He is nothing but trouble. Incidentally, there was one other benefit to embarking upon this errand. Have a look at this.

Lorenz: The magic staff, Thyrsus. A Relic passed down through House Gloucester for generations. It seems my father has finally recognized my ability. Apparently he had been considering entrusting this Relic to me for some time. He has had precious few opportunities to take to the field of battle personally, of late. Doubtless by giving this to me, he intends to send the message that I must work even harder. I will certainly continue to do my utmost. But I am by no means completely subservient to his will.
Byleth: Is all not well between you two?
Byleth: You disagree with your father's opinions?
Lorenz: I would not go so far as that. But my father seldom thinks beyond the immediate benefit of our house. While that is important, I prefer to consider the greater good when I make decisions. I believe that is a noble's duty. Now, for the time being, may I trust you to decide how we may best make use of Thyrsus? For the moment, I think you are in the best position to apply it to the betterment of all of FÃ³dlan.
Byleth: Are you sure?
Lorenz: To be quite honest, I am not certain I feel ready to decide the fate of a Relic on my own just yet. Do me this favor, Professor, and I will be grateful. Now, to celebrate! Allow me to treat you to tea.

@Opening 
Ignatz and Raphael, two sons of merchant families, set out to put an end to a series of monster attacks on merchants in Alliance territory.

@Intro 
Raphael:  So basically we just gotta defeat their leader, right? Then why don't we approach from...ugh! That won't work at all! Horses won't fit through there! I can't figure this out! I give up.
Byleth: Try to calm down and think it through.
Byleth: Shall we go over it one more time?
Raphael: But enemies never move how you want them to in a real battle, do they? I reckon I learn better on the battlefield.

Ignatz: Professor! I need to speak with you.
Raphael: Ignatz! You all right?
Ignatz: I received a letter from my brother back home. There's some disturbing news.
Byleth: What's going on?
Ignatz: Monsters have been attacking merchants within the Alliance territories.
Raphael: That happens all the time. I mean, that's how my parents died, so...
Ignatz: Ah, Raphael! I didn't mean to bring up such a sensitive topic in your presence.
Raphael: Hey, don't worry about that. C'mon, let's hear the rest of it.
Ignatz: Very well. These attacks seem to be focused on specific merchants.
Byleth: Like who?
Ignatz: Those who are traveling from the territory of House Gloucester to the Riegan Dukedom. Merchants traveling in the opposite direction, from Riegan to Gloucester, don't suffer nearly as many attacks.
Raphael: That doesn't make any sense. Someone's gotta deal with those monsters though.
Ignatz: Agreed. At this rate, my father and brother can't conduct business without risking their lives. Professor, could you assist me? I need your help exterminating these creatures.
Raphael: Now you're talking! I'm going too! I'm not learning anything in a classroom! You're gonna go, right, Professor? Don't you wanna help these folks?
Byleth: We depart at once. 
Raphael: Yeah! I knew you couldn't resist!
Ignatz: Thank you so much, Professor! And Raphael, I can't begin to express my gratitude.
Byleth: Not right now. 
Raphael: Seriously? Can't you see how important this is to Ignatz?
Ignatz: Ah, no, that's perfectly understandable. I'm sure the professor has much to do. But let me know if you change your mind, would you? If you can't come, I'll try asking some of the knights.

@Battle 
Merchant: Aah! Monsters! Begone!
Ignatz: Look! The monsters are attacking those merchants again.
Raphael: Looks like there are some humans mixed in there! Maybe they're controlling the monsters! If they are, do you think we just have to take out the leader?
Ignatz: Let's get started, before it's too late!

Raphael: The merchants can probably escape, but we gotta get rid of those enemies who are blocking the path!
Ignatz: Look, a drawbridge! We can use that to cross, but we'll need to lower it first.

Raphael: Oh no! Looks like we just lost one of the merchants!
Ignatz: Come on... Let's try to save the rest of them.

Merchant: No... Why?!
Ignatz: No! We couldn't save any of them?!
Raphael: Aaargh! They can't get away with hurting those merchants! I'm gonna make them pay!

Alliance General: What do you think you're doing? Don't get in the way of our duty!
Ignatz: Your duty? You're letting monsters wreak havoc on innocent people!
Alliance General: Shut it! It's got nothing to do with you!

Alliance General: I'm not looking forward to telling the count...
Raphael: Looks like we took care of 'em!
Ignatz: That man mentioned the count. What could Count Gloucester have to do with all this?

@End 
Merchant: Thank you so much! We're safe now and it's all due to your efforts! I can't bear to think what might have happened if you hadn't shown up.
Raphael: Yay! A happy ending for everyone!

Merchant: Thank you so much! We're safe now, but it's a shame we weren't all lucky enough to escape... We might've all met the same fate if you hadn't shown up.
Raphael: I'm real sorry we couldn't save everyone...

Ignatz: If you don't mind me asking....were you headed to the Riegan Dukedom?
Merchant: We were. We traveled around the Alliance selling our wares. I heard this route was dangerous, but...
Ignatz: Dangerous, you say. Are you referring to the recent cases of merchants being attacked on that route?
Merchant: That's right. We can't turn a profit without going to Derdriu. I don't know what Count Gloucester is thinking.
Byleth: This is the count's doing?
Ignatz: I had a feeling it might be. You're certain?
Merchant: Looks that way. I think he's unhappy with merchants contributing to House Riegan's wealth. It seems like he's been at odds with them forever. They say even the previous Duke Riegan's death...
Raphael: Was that the count's fault too?
Merchant: It's only a rumor, but it was Count Gloucester himself who lured the late Duke Riegan out. If I recall correctly...he invited the duke to his estate to strike a deal on some valuable art pieces. I believe the duke brought a pair of merchants with him to assess the pieces in question, but...
Ignatz: ...
Merchant: Alas, it seems those merchants lost their lives alongside him. A terrible misfortune. I wish these nobles wouldn't get us common folk mixed up in their feuds. You came from Garreg Mach, right? I'll send a token of our thanks over later.

Ignatz: ...
Byleth: Those merchants who lost their lives...
Raphael: Yeah, that was my ma and pa.
Ignatz: My parents received the request initially, but they had other business. They recommended Raphael's parents as substitutes. We could never have imagined...
Byleth: And Count Gloucester, isn't he...
Ignatz: Yes, he's Lorenz's fath--
Raphael: OK, OK! That's enough of that! It's just a rumor, right? So, who cares? Even if it's true, that's our parents' business. It's got nothing to do with us.
Ignatz: But you--
Raphael: You got no idea what really happened, right, Ignatz? And I bet Lorenz doesn't know either! The way I see it, it was monsters that killed my parents. They died in an accident. I got no reason to hate anyone or blame somebody else for their deaths. I don't have time for that. I got my little sis to worry about instead.
Ignatz: Raphael...
Raphael: Now that that's settled, let's head back! What do you think that merchant's gonna send us? I hope it's food!

Byleth: Raphael is a nice guy.
Byleth: Raphael is a good man.
Ignatz: Yes. He really is.

@Opening 
Ingrid receives an unexpected proposal of marriage from a noble of rising status. As soon as Dorothea hears the name, she is adamantly against any engagement between them...

@Intro 
Ingrid: ...

Dorothea: What's the matter, Ingrid? I never hear you sigh like that.
Ingrid: Oh, hi, Dorothea. And hello, Professor. Nothing's the matter. Well, nothing major.
Dorothea: You don't look like it's nothing major. Then again, I suppose you always have a furrowed brow, don't you?
Ingrid: Truth be told, there's rather a lot going on. It seems that there's always something to worry about...
Byleth: What do you worry about?
Ingrid: A childhood friend who's always causing trouble, my family... Things like that.
Byleth: What's worrying you right now?
Ingrid: Now? Oh, I really did not wish to bother you with such trivialities...
Ingrid: You see, I received a letter from my father recently.
Dorothea: From Count Galatea? What a kind gentleman to have for a father.
Ingrid: I thank you. But the content within the letter is what I find troubling.

Dorothea: Let me see! Oh, it's a marriage proposal... For you.
Byleth: Do you know the suitor?
Byleth: Have you ever met the suitor?
Ingrid: I've not met him, though I've heard his name here and there. He began life as a merchant but has somehow achieved rank in court. An enterprising noble from an allied territory. It's most likely that he wants the Crest of Daphnel that I bear to adorn his family name.
Dorothea: Hmm, yes, that sounds about right. The jerk.
Ingrid: You sound as though you know him. Do you?
Dorothea: Yes, I must admit that I know him. He tried to court me when I was a singer. Best advice I can give you, Ingrid? Stay far, far away from this guy.
Ingrid: He's offered a sizeable dowry, so I must at least consider itâfor the sake of my family.
Dorothea: Dowry? Ha! Blood money. That's all it is.
Ingrid: Dorothea, Iâ
Dorothea: This jerk's entire fortune is soaked in blood. Do you want to rebuild your own house using that kind of money? I mean, it's all just rumors, but I think it still might be worth investigating. What do you think, Professor? Should we go check this guy out?
Byleth: Let's go. 
Dorothea: Great. Let's tell the others.
Ingrid: Uh, really? OK...
Byleth: We don't have time. 
Ingrid: That's right, Dorothea. No point bothering. All of us, including the professor, are far too busy.
Dorothea: Are you sure? If you change your mind, Professor, just let me know.

@Battle 
Dorothea: Pft... The more we look into this guy, the more I see he's a monster, and no good for my Ingrid!
Ingrid: No kidding. There's no denying it. We'd better get back to the monastery.
Rogue:  Hold on a minute, you brats.

Rogue: Hand over the girl!
Ingrid: Surely you can't mean me. Wait... Did he send them?
Dorothea: This jerk figures he can grab Ingrid before things get too messy for him. Of course, we know the truth about him now, and he'll want to kill us and get rid of the evidence... But we'll never let him take Ingrid. Come on, let's hurry!

Dorothea: Protect Ingrid! Don't let anyone get near her!
Rogue: You'll never escape!

Merchant: I'll increase the reward! Now hurry up and capture that girl!
Ingrid: That merchant is giving order to the bandits! I bet if we take him out, reinforcements will cease!

Dorothea: It's an ambush! Ingrid's in trouble!

Ingrid: Enemies in hiding...here? They are really getting on my last nerve!

Rogue: Ha! Gotcha! Your future husband is eagerly awaiting his bride, you know.
Dorothea: Oh no! No! Ingrid!

@End 
Ingrid: Finally! It's over. I'm sorry for causing such a mess.
Dorothea: Oh, hush. For you, I'd go through twice as much trouble. But are you all right? Did they hurt you?
Ingrid: I'm OK. Really. Thank you, Dorothea. My father will need to hear of this.
Dorothea: Ingrid! Welcome back. Did you speak with your father?
Ingrid: I did. I just returned to the monastery.
Byleth: What happened with the proposal?
Ingrid: As soon as I informed him of the suitor's unsavory tendencies, he rejected the proposal outright. Were we to form ties with such an individual, it would bode poorly for our family, regardless of the weighty dowry offered.
Dorothea: Oh, thank goodness! I'm so glad it all worked out.
Ingrid: You and me both. My father also insisted I take this.
Byleth: A Hero's Relic?
Ingrid: Indeed. This is the magic lance, LÃºin, which has been passed down for generations within my family. My father and siblings have no way of using it, since they bear no Crest. Father told me I should take it and use it to protect myself with. He said it's far better used protecting his daughter than gathering dust.
Dorothea: Aw, that's so sweet! Your father really does mean well, Ingrid.
Ingrid: He's unendingly stubborn, but I am proud of who he is. Dorothea, Professor... I want to thank you.
Byleth: Of course.
Dorothea: We couldn't just do nothing while you were facing a life of being married to a monster.
Byleth: It was important that we help you.
Dorothea: It really was quite exciting too! So, you know, don't worry about it.
Dorothea: I could never hand over my lovely Ingrid to some jerk who only wants her for her Crest.
Ingrid: Oh? Do I belong to you now, rather than to myself? Hey... Dorothea. This is probably more than a little awkward, considering where it came from, but...here.
Dorothea: A ring? Is this... No! Is it?!
Byleth: A proposal?
Dorothea: Oh, Ingrid... I accept your offer! We'll be together forever!
Byleth: A bribe?
Dorothea: I mean, sure, I suppose... Clumsy bribe though, giving me a ring and not telling me why.
Ingrid: Stop teasing me, Dorothea! I'm trying to be sincere. I wanted to find a way to emphasize how grateful I am to you. So I looked for something from among my things that I thought you would like. I mean...you may already have one like it, but I thought on the off chance you didn't...
Dorothea: Ingrid, you are just adorable and I love it. But perhaps we should lend this ring to our teacher for now. Our dear teacher can best decide how to use it. You found hard enough. You've earned the right to have a little fun.
Ingrid: As you wish, Dorothea. I gave the ring to you, so you can do whatever you please with it.
Dorothea: Haha.

@Opening 
Safety for the people of the Kingdom has been a growing concern, and Fraldarius territory is no exception. Felix has been called upon to help restore order back home.

@Intro 
Felix: There you are. I was looking for you. I need a favor.
Byleth: Itâs unusual for you to ask for help.
Felix: Yes. Itâs an unusual favor.
Byleth: You want to spar, right?
Felix: No. This is more serious.
Felix: My father sent a messenger. He wants me to return to Fraldarius territory.
Byleth: Your father?
Felix: Rodrigue Achille Fraldarius, the highest ranking member of the Faerghus nobility. I believe you've met him. So I heard. But about the favor. Youâre familiar with the Tragedy of Duscur, I presume?
Byleth: I am.
Byleth: I canât recall.
Felix: Warriors from Duscur killed King Lambert of Faerghus.
Felix: After the kingâs death, public order disintegrated. Bandits continue to raid villages across the Kingdom, including those within Fraldarius territory. My father says he needs my help driving the bandits away.
Byleth: And you want me to join you?
Felix: Precisely. Good guess. Perhaps I shouldnât pull you into this... It stems from my familyâs failure to secure the region. But honestly, I want to see you in action. I never tire of watching you fight. And itâll be much more interesting for you than the training ground. Or maybe this task -- driving off bandits -- seems dull to a former mercenary?
Byleth: I'll join you. 
Felix: Excellent! While Iâm at it, I have a second favor to ask of you. Could you recruit more fighters? I bet there will be willing volunteers, if youâre the one inviting them. Iâll set off on my own and meet up with you there.
Byleth: Let me think about it. 
Felix: OK. I can handle a few bandits. If you change your mind about it, tell me soon.

@Battle 
Felix: Hmph. Struggling to defeat some bandits? What a pathetic old man my father is. Some villagers are trapped. Letâs help them escape.
Rodrigue: Felix, my son. Youâve finally brought reinforcements!

Rodrigue: Everything will be fine! Good people of this hamlet, escape while you can!

Rodrigue: The stronghold is ours. No more bandits should come crawling out of here.

Felix: Weakling. That should put a stop to their reinforcements.

@Battle-Talk 
%Byleth,Rodrigue
Rodrigue: So it's you! From the Officers Academy. Thank you for taking such good care of my son. It pains me to trouble you, but I humbly request your assistance in helping secure the villagers' safe escape!

%Felix,Rodrigue
Felix: Pathetic. Struggling to defeat some ragtag bandits.
Rodrigue: Felix... You may know this already, but no matter how many you kill, more always appear. Anywhere in the Kingdom these days you can see the same kind of scenes. His Majesty, the late king, would despair to see it.
Felix: A dead man doesnât despair. Besides, letâs focus on the living.

%Dimitri,Rodrigue
Rodrigue: Oh, Prince Dimitri is here to help! I am humbled, Your Highness, and so sorry to trouble you.
Dimitri: No, it is fine. As a man of royal birth, this is the obvious course. However, it does not exactly seem like they are remnants of Miklan's faction.
Rodrigue: Indeed. Nothing but common bandits, and yet... Ruffians like that have recently surged in number.
Dimitri: I am aware. For now, let us focus on saving the villagers.

@Battle 
Rodrigue: Outmatched by a damn bandit...
Felix: Come now. Stop living in denial, old man.

Rodrigue: I cannot die in this place... His Majesty would want me to keep going...
Felix: My foolish father... He's in trouble.

Rodrigue: Everyone, I'm sorry. It's over for me...

Villager: Thank you so much! Please, help my neighbors too.

Rodrigue: That should do it. Weâve chased those ruffians away for good.
Villager: Thank you so much for your assistance! Please accept this small gift as thanks.

@End 
Rodrigue:  We are grateful for your help. I doubt those bandits will stop anytime soon. But at least this village is safe. This village was important to the late king. If we hadnât saved it, I wouldnât have been able to face His Majesty.
Felix: How foolish.
Rodrigue: Pardon?
Felix: We were protecting your subjects, not your ego. I donât give a damn as to whether you can bring yourself to face a dead king.
Rodrigue: I will not tolerate such language from you.
Felix: I came here to hone my blade, and to save innocent people. I suppose if I had died, you would say the same thing you did after Glennâs death. âHe died like a true knight.â
Rodrigue: ...
Felix: I have nothing more to say. Iâm going back.

Rodrigue: I'm sorry you had to see that. He's been that way for four years now. Of course, I understand his sentiment, to some extent. It all comes down to... Well, a difference of opinion.

@Opening 
Five years after Rhea's disappearance, a letter that she wrote prior to that battle has surfaced. The mysterious message raises more questions than it answers...

@Intro 
Seteth: Here you are. There is something we need to discuss. I found this letter in Rhea's quarters. I believe it is intended for you.
Byleth: How do you know that?
Seteth: Simple. Your name appears at the top. Once I saw that, I decided not to read any further. I will admit, however, that I am quite curious. Will you permit me to read it along with you?

Rhea: Dear child... I have little time, and so I will keep this brief. I asked you to take care of things should something happen, but I wished to make myself useful as well. I left a treasure at the Holy Tomb. Please take it. However, note that I set a bit of a trap to prevent thieves from stealing it. Please take ample precautions so that you are not harmed when you retrieve it. May Sothis protect you... -Rhea

Seteth: Judging by the rushed handwriting, she must have written this just prior to the battle five years ago. I know nothing of this treasure, but it must be quite valuable. If you intend to recover it, then I will accompany you. Shall we go?
Byleth: Let's go. 
Seteth: The letter does indicate that Rhea laid some sort of trap in the Holy Tomb. We should bring some allies along, just to be safe.
Byleth: Not now. 
Seteth: This was clearly important to Rhea. It certainly warrants a closer look in my opinion. Let me know if you change your mind.



Gilbert: Professor. So this is where you were. I have something I would like to show you.
Gilbert: I found this in Lady Rhea's room. It seems to be a letter...addressed to you.
Byleth: Did you enter the room on your own?
Byleth: Did you check out the room on your own?
Gilbert: I admit some guilt to the action. However, I hoped Lady Rhea had left something behind. I have not read the contents of the letter. If you do not object, could we read it together?

Gilbert: Her handwriting is a mess. It is likely she wrote this letter five years ago, just before the battle. If Lady Rhea says it's a treasure, then I've no doubt it would be useful to us. If you plan to retrieve it, I will accompany you. What is your plan, Professor?
Byleth: Let's go. 
Gilbert: However, it says Lady Rhea laid some manner of trap in the Holy Tomb. Just to be safe, I'd like to request somebody to accompany us. We don't know what dangers await.
Byleth: Not now. 
Gilbert: I defer to your judgment, Professor. But are you sure? Please let me know if you change your mind.

Claude: Here you are, Teach. Take a look at this.

Claude: I found it in Rhea's room. It's addressed to you.
Byleth: Did you enter her room on your own?
Byleth: Did you look through her room on your own?
Claude: Well, I know it's not necessarily fair to Rhea, but there's no way I wasn't going to take a look. I thought I might find some valuable information. Or even some treasures that could be useful for the coming war! In the end...all I found was that letter. I obviously couldn't read it before you did. Go ahead. I'm sick with curiosity.

Claude: Her handwriting is messy. She must have written it right before that battle five years ago. That treasure... If it belongs to Rhea, there's no doubt that it has great value. It would be bad if some thief managed to sneak off with it. Let's go and get it, Teach!
Byleth: Let's go. 
Claude: Great! But...there's a trap there that might injure us? Huh. Just to be safe, there's a friend I'd like to invite as well. After all, who knows what lies ahead.
Byleth: Not now. 
Claude: Wow. Even though Rhea left that special treasure behind just for you... Let me know if you change your mind, OK? I'll be around.

@Battle 
Seteth: These are the guardians of the Holy Tomb. They will attack any intruders. We had better take care.

Seteth: Rather excessive merely to deter thieves, isn't it? We should target those commanding phantoms.

Seteth: These phantoms are strengthening the golems. We must defeat the phantoms first.

Seteth: That's one, but there are others. We need to handle all of these commanders.

Seteth: That's reduced the golems' strength. Now's our chance to take them out.

Seteth: We have subdued the Holy Tomb's guardians. Let us get what Rhea left behind so we can leave this place.

Seteth: Got it! Ah--this seems important.

Gilbert: Something is wrong. Do not let your guard down.

Gilbert: Phantoms? And some are giving commands. Remove them from the battlefield immediately.

Gilbert: Mechanical beasts... Locate their puppet masters, and eliminate them!

Gilbert: One down! Target the remaining commanders!

Gilbert: The puppets still move, but they appear weaker. Destroying them should be easier now.

Gilbert: It seems all is safe. Let's find Lady Rhea's treasure, quickly.

Gilbert: Here! So this is Lady Rhea's treasure...

Claude: There's something there. Are those the devices that Rhea warned us about?

Claude: Those are the phantoms... And some of them are giving orders. Let's target those first.

Claude: Giant monsters... It would be best to take care of whoever's controlling them straight away.

Claude: They may be phantoms, but they can still be harmed. Let's take out the other commanders!

Claude: Those giant monsters can still move, but they seem much weaker now. We should be able to finish them.

Claude: Looks like we made it through the madhouse. So where's this treasure that Rhea mentioned?

Claude: We finally found it. This must be...the treasure? Let's get out of here and take a look.

@End 
Seteth: Allow me to apologize, on Rhea's behalf, for putting you so squarely in harm's way. That much force should not have been necessary to deter mere thieves. Perhaps, in her haste, Rhea made a miscalculation.
Byleth: What kind of trap was that?
Byleth: Did Rhea really build all that?
Seteth: It is a little-known legend that the Holy Tomb was constructed by the goddess herself. That mirage, those guardians--I believe that trap was there from the beginning. It must have been disabled for the sake of the ceremony the last time you were there. Now, as to this treasure we've uncovered... This is an ancient Relic, blessed by the goddess and kept sacred by the Church. It is both a priceless piece of history and a holy artifact of extraordinary power. Rhea has entrusted it to you, and you may do with it as you wish. But please treat it with the utmost care.
Seteth: Well, I suppose that concludes this bit of business. I shall take my leave.



Gilbert: I never thought a Holy Tomb would have a trap such as that. Had we not been prepared... Yet, if Lady Rhea set that trap, then what kind of person is she?
Byleth: A goddess, maybe?
Byleth: A genius, maybe?
Gilbert: Perhaps you could go save Lady Rhea and ask her directly. Whatever the truth, still this treasure has been recovered. I do not know how much history is attached to this item, but it is an amazing artifact. It is possible this weapon once engraved its name in the history of the Church of Seiros. This is your responsibility, emparted to you by Lady Rhea. You must decide how best to make use of it.
Gilbert: I will be going now. I must prepare for our next battle.



Claude: Good grief! Rhea's trap was more extensive than I expected. Could something like that really be a result of sorcery alone? I don't understand the structure at all... It certainly wasn't made quickly.
Byleth: Was it made earlier?
Byleth: What it there from the beginning?
Claude: I think so. That trap may have been built into the Holy Tomb when it was first constructed. In which case, there might have been another purpose for building it, other than just as a saint's tomb... Now I have even more questions for Rhea. I hope we reunite with her soon. However, we now have a salvaged treasure... It might be something incredible... The church kept some of the legendary weapons that were blessed by the goddess. This isn't something one just stumbles across. Anyway, it was entrusted to you, Teach. Do what you will with it.
Claude: My curiosity has been satisfied for the time being, so maybe I'll return to my responsibilities...

@Opening 
Without a Crest or a family fortune, Leonie has a difficult time getting her hands on quality gear. Linhardt offers her a hint about a sacred weapon anyone can wield.

@Intro 
Leonie: Not bad at all, if I do say so myself.

Linhardt: I see needles and thread. What has you engaging in the textile arts, Leonie?
Leonie: Patching up a hole in my equipment bag. Take a look. What do you think?

Linhardt: If your objective is merely to block up the hole, then I believe you've performed quite adequate work.
Byleth: You might need a new one.
Leonie: I'm not going to throw away something I can still use. I can't afford to be wasteful.
Byleth: Maybe you should ask for help next time.
Leonie: Blocking the hole was all I cared about, so this suits me just fine.
Linhardt: Yes, but your bag is less bag and more a collection of dirty, smelly patches.
Leonie: Smelly, huh? I don't smell anything.
Linhardt: That aside, don't you have an allowance from your house to make purchases?
Leonie: No, nothing. Worse than that, actually. I'm in debt. I could only afford the Officers Academy because everyone in my village donated.
Byleth: The tuition is that expensive?
Leonie: It's not just that. In the Alliance, you have to pay the nobles as well in order to secure recommendations. Commoners can only get an education by borrowing money. It's pretty stupid. Not sure what makes the nobles think they've got the right toâ Oh, sorry, Linhardt. Forgot you're a noble.
Linhardt: If one is in a family that bears a Crest, then you're going to stand atop the social pecking order. I'd raise the topic with the goddess. She handed out Crests to the nobles after all.
Leonie: Just handed them out, huh? You make it sound pretty casual.
Linhardt: By the way, I have a weapon to recommend. It should suit a commoner such as yourself.
Leonie: That so? I just told you I don't have a lot of money.
Linhardt: You're not going to buy it from a merchant. If you find it, you can keep it for free.
Leonie: Now you've got my attention.
Linhardt: There's a legend I read recently about Saint Indech, one of the Four Saints of the Church of Seiros. 
Leonie: Uh-huh? Keep talking.
Linhardt: Sorry... Suddenly very sleepy. Nap time calls.
Leonie: Hey, come on! You can't just doze off in the middle of a story!
Linhardt: Long story short, there's a holy weapon hidden in Lake Teutates that you can use even without a Crest... 
Leonie: Lake Teutates? Right. Let's go, Professor!
Byleth: Me?
Leonie: What's with that look? Don't you want to help your lovely students?
Byleth: Lovely?
Leonie: Yeah. Me and Linhardt. Aren't we just the cutest?
Linhardt: Leave me be. I'm off to nap.
Leonie: We'll never find it unless you're there. If you're really that tired, we'll just have to carry you.
Byleth: I'm not sure I want to carry him.
Leonie: We'll bring more people. We'll take turns. Come on, Professor. You're coming, right?
Byleth: I will. 
Linhardt: If we're going now, I do suggest leaving Edelgard and Hubert innocent of our quest. Lake Teutates is a place that concerns the saints of the Church of Seiros. It may become bothersome should the two of them find out...
Leonie: I'm not fond of keeping secrets from friends, but I guess we can tell them when we get back.
Leonie: All right, let's go find this thing!
Byleth: Maybe later. 
Leonie: Ah, well. Guess it's just you and me, Linhardt.
Linhardt: Zzz...
Leonie: Let me know if you change your mind, Professor. Looks like I might be waiting here a bit.

@Battle 
Leonie: Linhardt! Wake up! We've reached Lake Teutates!
Linhardt: Huh? What? Oh, um. Yes. So we have.
Leonie: A temple on a lake, huh? Looks fancy. And that's a cute...uh...guard dog?
The Immovable: Guard dog? Is it I to whom you are referring?
Leonie: Whoa! A magic beast! And it talks!
The Immovable: Nuisance... You weaklings should turn tail and run!

Leonie: Uh, hi! We're actually, um, looking for something...
The Immovable: I know well what it is that you desire. If you want it, you must first complete my trial.
Linhardt: Of course we do. This is as awful as I expected. Perhaps we could go home now?
Leonie: Are you kidding? It's just a little fog! Come on, let's go talk to Mr. Magic Beast!

Linhardt: I suspect our opponent is an illusion. If we cut off the source of this magic, they should stop attacking.

@Boss 
The Immovable: Fine. Defeat me, and show me what you are capable of!

%Byleth,The Immovable
The Immovable: Could you be the incarnation of Sothis? Interesting... Let's test your mettle!

%Linhardt,The Immovable
Linhardt: We'll fight, but your form and mannerisms suggest that you might be...
The Immovable: If you want your wish to be granted, it is better that you fight me in ignorance.

%Leonie,The Immovable
Leonie: Hey, Mr. Magic Beast! If we defeat you, will you grant our wish?
The Immovable: Indeed, I will.
Leonie: Great! I may not have a Crest, but I'll give it my all!
The Immovable: You are an interesting young girl... I accept your challenge.

%Seteth,The Immovable
Seteth: You seem to be holding back. Thank you for that.
The Immovable: Hmph. Do not flatter me. My power is not what it once was. The best I can do nowadays is to have fun meddling with humans who wander in here.
Seteth: I see. We were hoping you might help us, but is seems that may be too difficult.

%Flayn,The Immovable
The Immovable: Oh! You're here too! I've always wanted to meet you, Cethâ
Flayn: I ask that you keep quiet, Uncle!
The Immovable: What's that? Cethâ
Flayn: Shh! Please keep quiet, Uncle!

@End 
The Immovable: You did well. The trial ends here... What sublime children of men... Go ahead. Name your desire.
Leonie: So, uh, we heard you're giving away free weapons?
Linhardt: Do be quiet, Leonie. Somewhere in this temple is said to rest the holy bow of Saint Indech. It is called "the Inexhaustible." Could you find it in your heart to let my friend here have it?
The Immovable: You have shown might deserving of my sacred bow. I will grant your wish.
Leonie: Yes! Thanks, Mr. Magic Beast!

Linhardt: Aren't you happy, Leonie? That's quite a bow, and it was completely free.
Leonie: I'll say. I've never seen anything like it. But is it really OK for me to take this?
Linhardt: I would say so, wouldn't you? After all, you went through an awful lot to get it.
Leonie: I know, but... Professor, maybe you should hold on to it for me. At least for a while.
Byleth: Why me?
Byleth: It's yours, Leonie.
Leonie: It's not a weapon just anyone can use. I can see that. I want to be more confident in my strength before I really call it my own. Even holding it right now makes me feel unworthy. I'd really appreciate you looking after it for me.
Byleth: I understand.
Leonie: Thanks, Professor. And everyone else who helped me too. I'm really grateful. Linhardt, I'm sorry I forced you to come along. But seeing such a kind-hearted person like you... Well, let's just say my opinion of the nobility's shifted a bit.
Linhardt: I'm not sure I completely understand, Leonie, but it sounds like praise, so I will take it as such.
Leonie: Now, let's get back to work! I need all the training I can get!

Linhardt: She already possessed the strength to use that bow... She went through the trouble of fighting a saint so she could claim that weapon as her own.
Byleth: A saint?
Linhardt: Or maybe you'd call it a saintly beast. In any case...
Linhardt: When the time is right, can you fill in Edelgard about what happened?
Linhardt: Oh, and please do let me use that bow. It's not exactly a Hero's Relic, but it is still rather fascinating, isn't it? I would love to learn to what extent the bow's connection to the Crest influences the weapon and perhaps even... Oh, it's been too much of a day, hasn't it? I'm feeling tired, so let's talk about this later. Good night.

@Opening 
Whispers of Death Knight sightings in Garreg Mach excite Caspar, but Mercedes has a much more pensive reaction. Something must be on her mind...

@Intro 
Caspar: Professor! Mercedes! What are you two doing here?
Mercedes: Um, we were just talking. Why do you look so flustered?
Caspar: Haven't you heard? An Imperial army was spotted near Garreg Mach!
Mercedes: Oh. Do you think they came to scout?
Caspar: Maybe? We could probably take care of 'em if that's the case... But I heard the Death Knight is out there!
Mercedes: The Death Knight...
Byleth: Is that a problem?
Byleth: Who was that again?
Caspar: Don't you remember? He's the guy who abducted Flayn! We fought him a bunch of times after that! Right, Mercedes? Oh. Is something the matter?
Mercedes: N-No. It's nothing. Really... Now's probably not the time, but I was just thinking of my brother.
Caspar: You have a brother?
Mercedes: Yes, but we have different fathers. He was a year younger than me.
Caspar: Why'd he suddenly come to mind?
Mercedes: You see--

Knight of Seiros: Quickly! You must prepare for battle! The Death Knight has been spotted in the Sealed Forest! He only has a few troops with him, so we planned on taking him out with just the knights, but... We can't guarantee that reinforcements won't arrive. We would appreciate your backup, just in case.

Mercedes: The Death Knight... I have to go...
Caspar: Mercedes, wait! I don't know what's going on with you, but...
Mercedes: No! I have to go see him!
Byleth: Let's go with her. 
Caspar: Yeah, we can't let him get away! I'll help Mercedes find the Death Knight! You go gather the others and meet up with us, Professor!
Byleth: I'm not so sure... 
Caspar: We don't really have time to sit around and think, but a little prep can't hurt against the Death Knight.
Mercedes: Yes... You two are right...
Caspar: Let me know when you're ready. Try not to take too long though, all right? It's not like the Death Knight is just gonna wander around the forest waiting for us to find him.

@Battle 
Mercedes: Emile, wait! Don't go! Take your helmet of. Please. Let me see your face. It really is you under there, isn't it? I've been searching for so long...

Caspar: I finally caught up with you, Mercedes. You're faster than you look... But I'm here now, so you can give up, Death Knight!
Death Knight: ...

Death Knight: Flee, and I will not chase you... Challenge me, and I will have no choice but to fight...

Mercedes: Enemy reinforcements are approaching! What should we do?
Caspar: Let's take 'em out! Reinforcements just means we get to fight even more!

@Boss 
Death Knight: I told you that if you fled, I would not chase you. But it seems you wish to die...

%Mercedes,Death Knight
Mercedes: You try to hide yourself with that mask and helmet...But I know who you really are.
Death Knight: I...have nothing to say to you.

%Caspar,Death Knight
Caspar: The Infamous Death Knight! Champion of the Empire! Taking you down is gonna be satisfying.
Death Knight: Heh. Simpleton...

%Byleth,Death Knight
Death Knight: Fate is unkind. There will be no resolution today... Flee, and I will not give chase.

@End 
Death Knight: Simple...but effective...
Caspar: You're not getting away that easy!

Death Knight: I must go...

Caspar: Phew...we did it. Are you all right, Mercedes?
Mercedes: I am, thanks to you. But still...
Caspar: There's something you wanted to ask him, right? Come on, he ran off into the forest.
Mercedes: Thank you, Caspar.

Death Knight: You came...

Mercedes: How many years has it been since we last spoke? I'm so sorry... I should have come for you sooner... I'm sure it wasn't pleasant living in House Bartels.
Caspar: I'm not sure I follow. Do you know this guy, Mercedes?
Mercedes: My younger brother... Emile... Is it really you?
Caspar: I'm sorry, what? Your brother is the Death Knight?! But you two look nothing alike!
Death Knight: Mercedes... Leave the monastery.
Caspar: Hold on just a minute! Is that all you've got to say for yourself?
Death Knight: This doesn't concern you...
Caspar: That's not true! You're her brother, right? But you've got nothing nice to say to her after all this time?
Death Knight: You will die...
Mercedes: Even if I die, I've made my choice. Please, Emile. Fight on our side instead.
Death Knight: I cannot. My soul has long departed... And yet... Here. Take this and go.

Mercedes: Is this...a Hero's Relic? You and I must share the same Crest.
Death Knight: When next we meet, I will kill you without hesitation.
Mercedes: You won't kill me. I have this now.
Death Knight: Hmph. Do not die until I can kill you...
Death Knight: Hmph.
Caspar: What is it? You got a problem with me?
Death Knight: Take... this...
Caspar: This is...
Death Knight: I will kill her. Until then, she must live...

Mercedes: Emile! I can't believe he's gone again...
Caspar: I can't tell whether or not he actually cares that you're his sister...
Mercedes: Hmm... Somewhere, hiding underneath that helmet, there's a very sweet boy.
Caspar: Is that a joke? Would a sweet boy threaten to kill someone? I don't get you, Mercedes.
Mercedes: Living at House Bartels changed him. But that's beside the point. Thank you, Caspar. I couldn't have confronted him without you.
Caspar: Don't worry about it. I may not understand you half the time, but we're still pals.
Mercedes: Come on then, pal. Let's get back to everyone else.

@Opening 
The ambitions of those who slither in the dark are forever shattered with Shambhala's destruction. But in the process, Rhea is grievously injured. What fate awaits her, and who will bear the weigh of FÃ³dlan on their shoulders?

@Dialogue
Rhea: Ugh...
Cyril: Hang in there, Lady Rhea
Seteth: She needs help! Hurry!
Manuela: That's a serious injury... It's a miracle that she's even alive right now. I'll do what I can, but...
Seteth: Five years ago, when this place fell an enormous white creature appeared on the battlefield. It was the Immaculate One... Rhea.
Byleth: She tried to save me...
Seteth: What? You already knew Rhea's true identity?
Byleth: Thinking back, I suppose so.
Seteth: I see. In the past the children of the goddess were all able to change their appearance, just like the Immaculate One. I lost that power long ago, but it seems Rhea has not.
Byleth: You're one of the children of the goddess?
Seteth: Is it not obvious? Flayn and I both are. We have protected Garreg Mach, and all of FÃ³dlan, for a very long time. But now... the light of Rhea's life is on the verge of disappearing from this world. It is flickering... I do not know if she can be saved. Even if she is, I wonder if she will remain unchanged...
Flayn: Professor. Are you able to carry on Rhea's work. As the protector of FÃ³dlan and as leader of the people who live here... You must defend the people. Guide them and teach them. Join their hearts and spread peace across the whole of the land.
Seteth: It is not as though you must become the archbishop. But FÃ³dlan needs leadership it is up to you to govern this war-torn land.
Byleth: I...
Seteth: You need not reply right this moment. We will strive to heal Rhea as best we can.
Flayn: Perhaps it would help to seek counsel from our friends at the monastery about this matter.
Seteth: I agree. When your mind is made up, please speak with me. I would ask that you give me your decision in the presence of Rhea herself.

@Conversation 
Ferdinand: Well done, Professor. We have brought the war to a magnificent conclusion. The Empire, Alliance, and Kingdom are no more. Nor are there any factions that could blindside us and cause conflict. Now it falls to us to rule FÃ³dlan, and bring about an era of peace and prosperity. You would be a fine choice for the first ruler of this new era. I sincerely believe that.
Byleth: Thank you. 
Ferdinand: So, your heart is already set on it! Excellent! In that case, congratulations are in order.
Byleth: I'm not sure.
Ferdinand: Well, if you are unsure, what does that say about everybody else's chances?
Ferdinand: I will follow you, Professor. I aim to be a great and respectable noble.



Linhardt: Congratulations on a job well done, Professor. I do hope Lady Rhea is well? Is it true what I heard? You will be taking over her post? Would that make you archbishop? Or higher still? Am I in the company of the future ruler of FÃ³dlan?
Byleth: Either would be a hassle. 
Linhardt: I agree! Imagine all that responsibility. Until now, you've always fought with all of us by your side. Bring ruler would be a much lonelier job, though I am certain you would excel.
Byleth: The latter. I will rule over FÃ³dlan.
Linhardt: So you've already decided... Such proactive thinking is the hallmark of a good ruler.
Linhardt: Me? I have no interest in a leadership role. I'm happy to spend the rest of my days studying...and napping.



Caspar: All... RIGHT! We did it, Professor! We really gave it to 'em out there! With all the fighting and hardships, I don't know how we did it... But I'm glad we made it through together!
Byleth: Me too. 
Caspar: Now all we gotta do is make you the new ruler! That's gonna be a fun coronation!
Byleth: It was a lot to push through.
Caspar: Sorry if I made your life more difficult! None of that matters anymore though, right? Now all we gotta do is make you the new ruler! That's gonna be a fun coronation!

Bernadetta: Phew... It's all over, Professor. Though I am worried about Lady Rhea... But still, FÃ³dlan is united, and those terrible people lurking in the dark have finally been destroyed. Looks like it's the dawn of a wonderful new era...of blissful seclusion for Bernie!
Byleth: That won't do.
Bernadetta: Wh-what? Why not?! Hey, that better not be your first official decree! You're going to ask for my help again, aren't you? Oh, why?
Byleth: Suit yourself. 
Bernadetta: Woo-hoo! You finally did it, Bernie! Now take your reward of eternal peace and quiet!



Dorothea: Finally! An end to the fighting. Have you ever felt happier? I've worried that I might not live to see this day, but here we are, and everything is going to be OK, isn't it? Huh, my heart feels like it's ready to burst. I'm so full of happiness, yet I feel a sense of loss too...
Byleth: We did lose a lot.
Dorothea: Yes, we certainly did. But we managed to keep a great many things safe, as well.
Byleth: We protected more than we lost. 
Dorothea: I agree. I suppose if I think of those who are gone as the people who ensured our freedom...it hurts less.
Dorothea: Please do what you can to keep the peace, so we never have to face such awful times again.



Petra: War has been ended. I will now be returning to Brigid. I hope in the new FÃ³dlan, Brigid can be accepted with friendship. When my professor becomes the leader, I think that will have a possibility. Please, choose well.
Byleth: Same to you. 
Petra: Yes. Now I must be packing.
Byleth: I'm not sure yet...
Petra: Is that the truth? I will be waiting for your decision. I will be packing while you are thinking.



Felix: It's over. What will you do? I heard you intend to lead.
Byleth: I'm not sure.
Felix: You shouldn't need that long to decide. Make up your mind.
Byleth: I'm more interested in what you'll do. 
Felix: Well, if you do choose to lead, I might like to work for you. But first, I'll go back to the old Faerghus territory. Where my father and my old friends once lived. I need to pay respects, put flowers on their graves.



Ashe: Well, it took a long while for us to get here, but we did it. The war is finally over. We've been through a lot together, haven't we? Let me just say, it's truly been an honor.
Byleth: The same to you.
Ashe: I'm flattered to hear you say do.
Byleth: Oh, cut it out.
Ashe: Hey, come on, I mean it! There's nothing to be embarrassed about!
Ashe: For whatever it's worth, I think you'd make a great monarch, and I'd support you every step of the way.



Sylvain: Ah, yow! She didn't have to slap me that hard. Oh, Professor, it's you. What's up? Need something?
Byleth: Lover's quarrel again?
Sylvain: I dunno if I'd call us lovers, exactly. Not yet anyway. It's was just a dinner invite.
Byleth: Don't need anything, but... 
Sylvain: Heh, you worried I might cause trouble again? Nah, I just invited a girl out to dinner.
Sylvain: All fighting and no loving makes Sylvain a rusty boy. Well, I can get back in practice now. Peacetime is the best for love--nobody dying, nobody getting hurt...except me, apparently. If you're gonna be the ruler, you need to keep the peace going so I can catch up on my love life.



Mercedes: I heard a rumor that you're going to take over for Lady Rhea!
Byleth: It hasn't been decided.
Mercedes: Oh, so the rumor was really true? I hope you accept. I don't think there's anyone else who could do it.
Byleth: That's the plan. 
Mercedes: So it's already been decided? That's very admirable of you, Professor.
Mercedes: You have nothing to worry about. We're here to help you if you need anything at all! We'll support you no matter what path you choose to follow!



Annette: Is Lady Rhea OK? She was quite weakened to start, and then she took all those heavy injuries... I don't want to imagine it, but what will happen if Lady Rhea passes away like this?
Byleth: We'll cross that bridge if we come to it.
Annette: I suppose you're right.
Byleth: I'm sure she'll be fine. 
Annette: Yes. I'm praying every day that she'll get well as soon as possible.
Annette: Anyhow... You're going to be the ruler, Professor? It's so strange to think of, for some reason!



Ingrid: Can it really be? Are we truly at peace? To think that my days will not be spent debating war tactics and preparing for battles. It doesn't quite feel real. Now that we are finally at peace, I'm not quite sure what to do with myself.
Byleth: Just take it easy.
Ingrid: That sounds...challenging for how easy it must actually be.
Byleth: Maybe you should think about the future now. 
Ingrid: Thinking of the future has never been my forte.
Ingrid: As long as I have a routine in place for myself, I can find contentment.



Lorenz: The day is ours, Professor. And this victory will ensure our names are immortalized in history. Or perhaps this is but the opening chapter in the tale they will write of our glory. After all, if you are to rule this reunited land, surely there is bound to be a place for me at your side?
Byleth: Absolutely. 
Lorenz: I read your mind, didn't I? Fear not! I will not fail to rise to the occasion!
Byleth: Nothing's decided yet.
Lorenz: Is that so? It seems to me that everyone has already assumed you would take the position.
Lorenz: Regardless, your decision will have an impact on my future, so be sure to make it a good one!



Raphael: Hey, Professor! I was just thinking I might go train. I know the war's over, but that doesn't mean I can stop working my muscles!
Byleth: That makes sense. 
Raphael: I'm glad you see it my way! I always knew you were a smart one!
Byleth: You should work on other things too.
Raphael: Really? I wouldn't know where to start, but...
Raphael: There's no harm in keeping up with my training!



Ignatz: After all that's happened to Lady Rhea, all of the stuff with Solon and the others, and everything that's happened with you, Professor... There's still a lot I don't understand. Please teach me, Professor--everything you know, everything you've learned.
Byleth: OK. 
Ignatz: Thank you, oh thank you!
Byleth: If I get the chance...
Ignatz: If it's at all possible, I hope you'll speak about it not just to me, but to everyone else as well. I think everyone should know what happened here. If we're going to build a new, united FÃ³dlan...that's absolutely crucial.



Lysithea: Those who slither in the dark will never harm anyone again. They're finally done for. Thank you, Professor. Finally, I feel some vindication for what I've gone through.
Byleth: No, thank you, Lysithea. 
Lysithea: Ah, Professor. Ever the modest one. I do like that aspect of you.
Byleth: Keep up the good work.
Lysithea: Uh, sure thing.
Lysithea: As long as I'm of use here, I'm happy to stick around, Professor.



Marianne: And with that, we can finally enjoy a time of peace. I'm honored to have fought by your side. Even if you haven't made plans yet, I know you'll do your best, whatever your future may hold.
Byleth: You've grown much stronger.
Marianne: If true, that's all thanks to you and our allies.
Byleth: You've become quite the optimist. 
Marianne: I never would've dreamed my heart could have grown this way.
Marianne: Please let me know if there's anything more I can do.



Hilda: Hey, Professor! The war is finally, really, definitely over now, right? We're not gonna find out there was some evil shadowy figure hiding behind the subterranean guys, are we?
Byleth: Who knows.
Hilda: Well, whatever. No matter what comes, I know we can triumph in the end!
Byleth: I don't think so. 
Hilda: Ah, that's good! Though to be honest, there's not much that would surprise me at this point...
Hilda: I feel invincible! A nice perk of being your student, don't you think?



Leonie: Well, we both made it. And we avenged Jeralt too. Can't say it gets any better than that. You've got a lot of work ahead of you, I hear. People want you to govern, don't they?
Byleth: It's a hassle.
Leonie: Yeah. Sadly, this isn't the kind of burden I can take off your hands.
Byleth: It's a dilemma.
Leonie: Well, at the end of the day, it's your decision. Just take your time. Think it through.
Leonie: You've got to consider it carefully, so you don't have any regrets. Whatever you choose, though, just know that I'm here for you.

Alois: We did it, Captain!

Leonie: Make sure you've got no regrets.

Alois: At last, the day is upon us. The captain would be pleased. Don't you think, Leonie?
Leonie: Definitely. And he'd be proud of the professor too.
Alois: It seems like our efforts have been rewarded. It was certainly a long, difficult struggle to get here.
Leonie: It was. Oh, Jeralt... We worked so hard for this.
Byleth: Uh, hello?
Alois: Whaaaaaah!
Leonie: Aaah! How long have you been standing there?!
Alois: Er, ahem. Whether or not you choose to succeed Lady Rhea, we will forever be by your side.
Leonie: Yeah. We'll be here no matter what you decide. But make sure you think it through. You don't want to have any regrets.



Seteth: Well? Is your mind made up?
Byleth: No.
Seteth: I understand. Just know that we are applying all our power right now toward healing Rhea. You should take this opportunity to speak with everyone. I am certain it will do you good.
Byleth: Yes



Flayn: I have faith in Lady Rhea's convalescence, but even so, what she needs now is rest. And while she is recovering, somebody must watch over FÃ³dlan. There is no one more fit to wear such a mantle than you, Professor. That is what I believe. I do not doubt the others feel the same.



Hanneman: Shambhala... An underground city with an entirely different lineage than the goddess? Strange phenomena, driven by a source totally alien to the Crests that we understand. Most unsettling! Could it be magic? Some manner of technology? I would like to know the truth of it all. Very much so. I want to know their history, their knowledge. Why do you suppose they chose this place to occupy?
Byleth: Well, I don't know.
Hanneman: No, I suppose you wouldn't... It seems we will have to excavate Shambhala to know more. Although, I heard you will be the Ruler here? Should I ask your permission to proceed with the dig?



Manuela: Life can be tough, you know? But if you've got your friends to help you through, it can be a lot easier. Maybe you butt heads sometimes...but that's OK. That's how you build bonds, right? And I've got friends, Professor. Plenty of those. It's true love that seems to have passed me by.
Byleth: You should relax.
Manuela: Relax? I'm relaxed.
Byleth: There's still hope. 
Manuela: But where is my true love to be found? Where is my ray of hope?
Byleth: Time to give up?
Manuela: Yeah... I'm starting to figure that's the most realistic option.
Manuela: At this point, I'm just hoping you stay single too. Then at least we can share each other's misery!



Alois: Jeralt... We've done it. We've finally brought this creaky old ship ashore. The fight was long and bitter, but finally...I can lay down my burden.
Byleth: Uh, hello?
Alois: Whaaaaah! It's you! Don't creep up like a ghost. Next time, announce yourself. Er, ahem. Whether or not you choose to succeed Lady Rhea, I will forever be by your side. You should live your life however you want. That's what the captain would say, I think.



Catherine: Lady Rhea stopped the forces that threatened to destroy FÃ³dlan. She's trying to realize her own dream of peace. Isn't that enough? Can't you let her rest? If you're the only person who's fit to replace her, you should just do it. I'm sure Lady Rhea wishes for that too, right? I can't think of anyone who's more well suited to the job.



Shamir: The war's finally over... I have to admit, even I got a little emotional. Rhea's condition doesn't look good. There's nothing to do now but wait. More importantly, are you serious about becoming FÃ³dlan's new ruler?
Byleth: I'm not sure. 
Shamir: It's pretty sudden. Either way, do what you think is best.
Byleth: I am.
Shamir: You made up your mind pretty quickly. Either way, do what you think is best.



Cyril: Professor, do you figure Lady Rhea will be OK? She will, won't she? I don't care one bit who'll succeed Lady Rhea, 'cause nobody's gonna need to. She's gonna be happy and healthy again. You'll see.



Anna: I can tell that things will settle down soon enough. Gotta get back to slinging wares and making moolah! And hopefully no more messes to spoil it after this...

Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Say, how is the archbishop faring? The soldiers and citizens are all concerned! Just when we thought peace had finally arrived... What's to become of FÃ³dlan?

@Intro 
Rhea: Sweet child... You have finally come... I am so happy. It does my heart well to see you here, safe and sound.
Seteth: Have you made your decision, professor? Thankfully, Rhea has survived her trying ordeal. However... There is no telling how much longer her light will continue to shine.
Flayn: Professor, have you decided? Will you become the next ruler of FÃ³dlan?
Byleth: ...
Rhea: Before I hear your answer, I shall fulfill the promise I made to you. You will know the truth about your identity... I will hold nothing back. I... created you. And within you is the crest stone of the progenitor god... I hid the crest stone within your heart in order to revive her. Sweet child... I am sorry. I wanted to see her... see my mother... even if it meant doing that which is forbidden.
Byleth: What does it all mean?
Rhea: I thought that I could regain all I had lost, if only I could revive my mother... And so I tried to bring her back by creating a body, and then burying a crest stone within it. A young woman I created... my twelfth try after much heartache... was a failure. She grew up lacking the conscience of the progenitor God and fell in love with the captain of the Knights of Seiros. In time, she became pregnant... but she and the child were not able to survive the birth. The child she bore was not breathing, and she herself was in grave danger. The new mother pleaded with me to take the crest stone of the progenitor god from her own body and place it within the baby. If I had done nothing, both mother and child would have died. And so I granted her final wish. As she had hoped, the baby started breathing again... The new life was saved. Your life, sweet child.
Byleth: ...
Rhea: Well before that, I had saved Jeralt's life using the power of my blood. That means you are the child of a mother born of the progenitor God's crest stone and a father who carried my own blood. I knew, deep in my heart, that you would be capable of housing the conscience of the progenitor god. I was right... And yet, she merely gifted her power to you and then disappeared once more. My dearest wish did not come true... but here you are. You alone wield the power of the progenitor God. And now, I must ask you to use that power to save this world. You must...

Rhea: What... No... Arrgh!
Seteth: Rhea?! Rhea!
Flayn: What is wrong? Please calm yourself, Rhea!
Rhea: GRAAARGH!
Seteth: Is the power of the crest taking over her body? Why is this happening?!
Knight of Seiros: Seteth! It's terrible! White beasts have appeared all over Garreg Mach! It's hard to believe, but there have been reports that the priests and Knights have been changing form.
Seteth: White beasts... Are they the ones Rhea shared her blood and stones with?
Church Soldier: Seteth! Demonic beasts are heading this way!
Seteth: They are after Rhea... Professor, our situation is dire. If we do nothing, FÃ³dlan will be destroyed by a rampaging Immaculate One and these children of hers. There is only one way to stop this. We... we must... Damn it! We have no choice but to kill the Immaculate One... to kill Rhea!

@Opening 
Though showing brief signs of recovery, even Rhea's strength has its limits. Having changed form to The Immaculate One, she is unable to control her power. As if in Response, priests and knights who are directly related to Rhea by blood change into White Beasts themselves. Facing this unexpected threat, the resistance army prepares for its final battle to save FÃ³dlan.

With Shambhala in ruins, the five-year war is finally at an end and a new age of peace has arrived. Not long for this world, Rhea wishes to discuss FÃ³dlan's future with you/you. But all is not well...

@Battle 
Seteth: It is kept secret, but there is a certain rite that all initiates to high office in the church must undergo. In this rite, one pledges to serve the goddess and in return, receives a Crest Stone fragment and blood. The ones who have transformed alongside Rhea just now are the ones who have accepted those gifts. They will shield Rhea--the Immaculate One, I should say--with their very lives. But if we do not strike her down, FÃ³dlan will have no future. To arms!

Seteth: Surrounded already, it seems. The White Beasts are those in whom Rhea's blood flows strongest. Until we get rid of them, we will not be able to so much as touch Rhea.
Caspar: Damn. After all that's happened...why do we have to kill Lady Rhea?

Bernadetta: Isn't the fighting already over?! Why do we have to do this to Lady Rhea?!

Ferdinand: The Immaculate One. We cannot afford to lose here, whoever our foe may be!

Seteth: Stop! Any damage to the Immaculate One will only be transferred to those beasts.
Petra: It is seeming that my understanding of FÃ³dlan tradition is...insufficient. What is happening?
Seteth: It is too dangerous to approach her now. Capture the southern stronghold first to seal the beasts away!

Seteth: They're coming one by one from the southern stronghold. If we do not capture it, there will be more.

Seteth: Let us turn our attention to the Immaculate One.
Dorothea: This is it. The final battle.
The Immaculate One: Graaaargh!

Seteth: Rhea?! Not even I have seen this form!
Linhardt: Well, that's something, isn't it? A shame we must kill her. Consider the research potential...

@Boss 
%Seteth,The Immaculate One
Seteth: I will inherit the pride of Nabatea. Rest in peace by Sothis's side!

%Flayn,The Immaculate One
Flayn: Rhea... How tragic. But there is no time to waste. She must be stopped!

%Catherine,The Immaculate One
Catherine: Lady Rhea... With my sword, I will put an end to your suffering.

%Cyril,The Immaculate One
Cyril: This is me, paying ya back. No matter what, I'll stop Lady Rhea!

@End 
Seteth: Rhea! Please!

@Cutscene 
Rhea: You're here, Mother...

@Narration 
A rising flame was alight as the flow of time carved a new history for FÃ³dlan. Rhea's wild rampage was put to an end, averting what could have the greatest crisis in the history of FÃ³dlan After five and a half years of war, a new age was set to begin. The Empire, Kingdom, and Allianceâall political structures that had once shaped the continentâwere gone. A unified nation began to take shape under the watchful eye of the Church of Seiros. The church's new leader became a champion of the people, working tirelessly to help them overcome the horrors of war and to carve a path towards reconstruction. Just as Saint Seiros tended to those who suffered in wars of the past, FÃ³dlan's new ruler embraced their role as mother of all life and arbiter of every soul.

@Opening 
The resistance army successfully takes Fort Merceus. Their victory celebrations are cut short, however, when javelins of light pierce the sky and destroy much of the fort. With nowhere else to go, the resistance army withdraws to Garreg Mach. Under the guise of surrender, they secretly prepare for a surprise attack on the Imperial capital.

@Dialogue 
Seteth: It seems the preparations for our invasion of Enbarr are advancing smoothly. All has been laid out so we can move swiftly to the necessary locations. Until the time comes, please try to keep your spirits up.
Byleth: I understand.
Seteth: There is something else... I have heard that Rhea is potentially being held captive in the capital. The information could not be confirmed, nor even properly sourced, but even still... We cannot ignore the possibility. Please bear that in mind.
Byleth: If it's true, we'll find her.
Seteth: Yes. We must not let anything get in the way of rescuing her.
Byleth: I don't believe it.
Seteth: Do not say that. To receive any information at all is surely a boon. If it is true, we must not let anything let in the way of rescuing her.


Flayn: We're finally heading to Enbarr. The capital city of the Empire... So many memories there...
Caspar: Oh yeah? So you've been there before?
Flayn: Oh! Um. Yes. Though it was a very long time ago.
Caspar: A very long time? You must have been really young. I'm surprised you remember.
Dorothea: The main stage of the Mittelfrank Opera Company is in the capital... I hope no one from the opera gets swept up in the coming chaos...
Linhardt: There are many buildings straight out of the history books in Enbarr. I hope they remain unharmed...
Dorothea: You're worried about the buildings? What about the people? You're an odd one, Lin.
Linhardt: I am also worried about the people. I'm sure my father is in a palace in the capital.
Flayn: Many people reside in Enbarr, so we must take care to avoid needless casualties.
Bernadetta: I don't think Edelgard cares much for avoiding casualties, so that's probably impossible. I bet we'll be fighting until one side or the other is completely destroyed.
Petra: Bernie, you should be staying away from thoughts like that. We will be defeating her with our full power. Our enemy has great strength, but we will not be losing!
Ferdinand: I could not agree more. Remember, even if our surprise attack works, a force even greater than all of our troops combined awaits us in the capital. Zero casualties is always the goal, but we must not underestimate the situation at hand.
Flayn: Still, we must not hold ourselves to the same twisted morality that she does. After all, we are here to stop her, not to follow her down her dark path. We all choose to fight back. We are all in this together!
Bernadetta: You're right, Flayn. We've got to try our hardest!
Dorothea: A different path from Edelgard...
Ferdinand: There is no stopping her. The only way to end this is to kill her.
Petra: Our choice... Flayn, your words are wonderful and full of bravery.
Caspar: Let's go! We can't lose!
Linhardt: The situation is dire...and so I will do what must be done.
Flayn: I am certain that if we can join our strength, we can win this battle without losing a single soul!

@Conversation 
Ferdinand: Professor. At last, the end is nigh. I love the Empire. Part of me wants it to survive. But I know that is not reasonable. The Empire's time has come. What we need now is a mighty leader who can rebuild FÃ³dlan and rule it as a single nation. Nonetheless, it saddens me that we will not have an Adrestian emperor...



Linhardt: They used to call Enbarr the city of Seiros... To assault it, together with the knights, is surreal. If Seiros were alive today, I wonder what she might make of our war... In Enbarr, there was once a Southern Church, and apparently a bishop was dispatched to it. A hundred years ago, the Southern Church became entangled in an insurrection. Until five years ago, the Empire and the church maintained a certain distance from one another.



Caspar: It's such a relief that we've made it this far without having to fight my father.
Byleth: You'll have to face him at some point.
Caspar: Hey, don't try and scare me!
Byleth: It sounds like you're scared. 
Caspar: You bet I'm scared! The Imperial army hasn't lost a single battle with my father on the field!
Caspar: If he turns up as a reinforcement during the assault, we might lose. I better make peace with that.

Bernadetta: Professor! My, um, my mother might be in the city. I don't have many good memories of her if I'm being honest, but she's dearer to me than my father. If you happen to see her, please make sure she's not caught up in all the fighting. She's only a civil servant, so hopefully she takes a cue from her Bernie and stays inside.



Dorothea: The whole of the capital is going to be a battleground. The city has such a long heritage... Even so, perhaps it deserves to be reduced to ashes for once. But we can't let the commonfolk get hurt. We should try to confine the damage to the noble section of town.



Petra: Five years ago...Edelgard said a thing to me. Brigid is a vassal of the Empire. But she also said I always have the freedom to be choosing whether I am with or not with her. I will become the ruler of Brigid. So she said I must make my own path. So now, my path and her path will be colliding.



Felix: The Death Knight is no ordinary knight. I will prey upon him. I will quench my blade's thirst with his blood. His focus is on fighting you, I'm sure. But mine will be the last face he sees.



Ashe: Those things appeared as soon as we got ourselves set up in Fort Merceus.



Sylvain: So Enbarr, the capital of the Empire. It's finally time. I never thought I'd live this long. It's like any battle, really--stay calm, stay focused. Don't give in to the enemy or your own fear.
Byleth: You seem more serious than usual.
Sylvain: Hey, I'm always serious! When I'm chasing girls or preparing for battle, always serious. That's me...
Byleth: We'll get through this together. 
Sylvain: Striking down the Empire is my offering to His Highness. Heh, I left the Kingdom... What am I saying?



Mercedes: It's been so long since I've been to the Imperial capital. I used to go to the opera there with my mother and brother. I never thought my return would be like this...



Annette: Enbarr... Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I'd be returning like this. Of course, most of the nobles in the Empire make their home in the capital. In the Kingdom, all nobles live in their own domains. So if the capital is attacked, it doesn't affect them directly. What will happen to the Imperial nobles when their capital becomes a battlefield?



Ingrid: Once this battle is over, what will become of Faerghus and FÃ³dlan?
Byleth: Peace will reign. 
Ingrid: Peace you say? It sounds so...foreign, so unattainable. But maybe...just maybe.
Byleth: What would you like to see happen?
Ingrid: My hope is for a world of peace. A world in which this present turmoil is a thing of the past--the stuff of legends. I believe those who survive the atrocities of war have a duty to create a new, better world. So the sooner we can stamp out such turmoil, the better. We must win, Professor. There is no alternative here. I won't allow for anything else.



Lorenz: I have been to the Kingdom capital before, but never to the Imperial one. They say it is the biggest city in all FÃ³dlan, so we will no doubt have many civilians to worry about. I hope we can preserve the city. If it is destroyed in the battle, the people will face hardship. I would say we should avoid the use of excessive force, but I suppose that hinges upon the Empire's terms of engagement.



Raphael: We're heading up to Enbarr next. I hope I make it back safe so I can tell my little sis about it! I hear they got a neat opera house there where Manuela used to perform. What was it called again?
Byleth: Mitreflanc Opera Company.
Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!
Byleth: Mittelfrank Opera Company. 
Raphael: Ah, that's the one!

Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!
Raphael: My little sis always goes on about how much she'd like to see them perform. I know we can't see a show, but do you think we can at least see the building?



Ignatz: We're about to put the finishing touches on this war. I wonder how FÃ³dlan will look without the backdrop of death and destruction. I can't wait to see it. On the other hand, I'm terrified of what the future might hold. Who knows if I'll survive the assault on the capital?



Lysithea: Invading the capital and smashing the Empire. I wonder if doing so could really end this war. Care to share your thoughts, Professor?
Byleth: I think it'll end the war.
Lysithea: You say that with such confidence. I want to believe that it's true.
Byleth: I don't know. 
Lysithea: Perhaps you feel similarly to me. The whole mess puts me on edge.
Lysithea: Although for now, better to focus my efforts on the fight at hand.



Marianne: So, if we win the war...will you become the ruler of FÃ³dlan?
Byleth: That might be the case. 
Byleth: I don't really know.
Marianne: You seem unsure, so I guess anything is possible. For what it's worth, I think you'd make a good ruler. You could bring peace to the land...



Hilda: Fighting in the capital? Ugh! And we're fighting against Edelgard! Double ugh! But with you leading us, Professor, I know we'll win. Yeah! Wahoo! Fighting! I'm a little scared, to be honest. I'm just shouting to relieve the tension, but I'll be fine.



Leonie: We're finally going to the capital. This will be my chance to avenge Captain Jeralt. Once we smash the Empire, I'm sure his soul will finally be able to rest in peace.
Byleth: I think you're right. 
Byleth: Who can say for sure?
Leonie: Monica killed Captain Jeralt for the Flame Emperor, and the Flame Emperor was Edelgard. I know that the future of all FÃ³dlan rests on this battle. Nothing else is more important. But for me, this is personal. For Captain Jeralt's sake, I'm going to give it all I've got and more!



Seteth: Rhea will be somewhere in the city. I wonder if she can sense us coming. If we are able to save her, then I expect you will learn many secrets that have hitherto been kept from you. Are you prepared for that?
Byleth: I am. 
Seteth: Excellent
Byleth: I don't think I'm ready yet.
Seteth: That is unfortunate. Well, you must become ready.
Seteth: The battle will soon be upon us. Let us both be at our best for what is to come.



Flayn: I was born in Enbarr. My mother and father met in a church there. Not too long after, I was brought into the world. I do not understand how war can happen in such a precious place. It is most regrettable.



Hanneman: Enbarr's streets are paved with unhappy memories, Professor. I've avoided the darned place ever since I abandoned my nobility. Swore never to return. Now here we are. To return in this manner... Well, I can't say it is something I ever imagined.



Manuela: In the opera, actors came and went all the time. But the people behind the scenes would stay forever. I'll bet I'd know a few of them now, even after all these years. I wonder if they've left the capital. I certainly hope so...



Alois: Here we are, facing the final battle with the Empire. It's been a long, difficult struggle. We have to get Lady Rhea back! And we have to crush the Empire, in the name of Captain Jeralt. I don't know what comes next. But we can sort out those details later.



Catherine: Looks like we're nearing the end of this struggle. I'm sure Lady Rhea is on tenterhooks waiting for me to swoop in and rescue her.
Byleth: Probably 
Catherine: I was just kidding! Pay me no mind.
Byleth: I doubt it.
Catherine: Oof... You don't mince your words. Try being a bit more mindful of other people's feelings.
Catherine: Lady Rhea's not waiting for me, I know, no matter how much I might wish she were. She's waiting for you.



Shamir: Ten years ago, Dagda and Brigid attacked the Empire from the west. Their final target was the capital. But they were countered at a port town, long before they reached their destination. I guess our attempt has been more successful than theirs, all things considered.



Cyril: Whenever I think about how we'll be seeing Lady Rhea real soon, I get happy and really get cleaning! We'll get there for sure, right? We'll see her again?
Byleth: We'll meet her for sure. 
Byleth: We don't know for sure.
Cyril: I just gotta believe Lady Rhea is waiting for us in the capital... We just have to find her.

Anna: There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Momentum's really picking up for this final battle, huh? Even I'm starting to feel tense! ME! Enbarr's history goes back 1,400 years. That even predates the founding of the Empire. It's one of the sacred sites of the Seiros faith, so it's a pretty big deal. But hey, no need to worry about the monastery while you're fighting the final battle. I've got it covered! I'll defend it to my last!

@Opening 
The resistance army, having finished preparations for their surprise attack on the Imperial capital, departs Garreg Mach. Along the way, they join forces with ally soldiers who had already secretly entered Empire territory. Together, they storm the streets of Enbarr, giving the Imperial army no time to counterattack.

Vastly outnumbered by Imperial forces, it becomes clear that a surprise attack, followed by a short and decisive battle, is the only path to victory. With this in mind, you stealthily approach Enbarr, the Imperial Capital.

@Intro 
Seteth: There it is. The greatest city in all of FÃ³dlan... Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Deep within are the palace grounds, where the emperor resides. If Rhea is being kept here, she must be within the palace... We shall tear through the city streets, capture the palace, and kill Edelgard at last.
Shamir: If the enemy spots us, they'll call back any troops deployed in other areas. We have no leeway here.
Cyril: Lady Rhea, please be safe.
Seteth: Now, we must organize our reserve troops and invade Enbarr!

@Battle 
Seteth: It appears that Hubert and the Death Knight are in command of the Empire's forces in the city. We've not the time to deal with them one by one. Split up and take both on at once!

Imperial Soldier: It's here! The Crest of Flames banner! There! On the other side of the canal!
Hubert: Uninvited guests, I see. Heh. Let's ensure they receive a warm welcome. Ready the artillery. Prepare to attack. Rocks, arrows, magic--rain death upon the enemy until they are silent as the grave. Reinforcements will fly in shortly. Defend the heavy weapons until they arrive.


Hubert: Our first wave of reinforcements is here. It will not be long until the next.
Seteth: Their reinforcements just keep on coming. We need to secure the artillery. That will make it easier to deal with them.

Hubert: We have reinforcements coming in from another direction. Deploy them as soon as they arrive.

Flayn: That church... It looks familiar. I believe that is where my parents first met.

Seteth: Ah--that church. I've such memories of that place. From a time before I was Seteth.

Manuela: Has it really been so long since I was in that opera house? Couldn't have imagined any of this back then.

Dorothea: The battle is nearing the opera house. I hope everyone in the company is safe.

@End 
Seteth: We have finally made it. I am sure that Edelgard is hiding in the palace, awaiting our arrival...
Flayn: Who is that? Is that not Dedue?!
Dedue: I heard knights had arrived. I came here to find you.
Byleth: How long have you been in Enbarr?
Dedue: I arrived not long after the battle at Gronder Field. I am here to kill Edelgard.
Byleth: What are you doing in Enbarr
Dedue: I'm waiting for a chance to kill Edelgard. I have not yet been blessed with the opportunity.
Flayn: Will you now fight alongside us?
Dedue: We fight for different objectives. I swore to offer Edelgard's head to his Highness. But... Should I fail, I will have no choice but to entrust that mission to you. This is the information I have gathered during my time in hiding here. It includes details about the inside of the castle. There's more. The archbishop is being held in the palace. I do not know the exact location.
Seteth: Indeed! Just as we suspected!
Alois: It seems we chose wisely when we decided to fight against the Empire!
Dedue: I've done what I came here to do. Farewell.
Flayn: Wait a moment!

Flayn: He is gone. I believe we should make our way there as well!
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
The resistance army, having received reinforcements from House Daphnel in Ailell, is finally ready to unleash its invasion on the Imperial territories.

@Dialogue 
Seteth: The messenger we sent to Claude has returned. It seems he will be initiating the plan immediately. We will advance when House Riegan's forces move out. We will take the Great Bridge of Myrddin with minimal casualties, and in doing so, initiate all-out war with the Empire. We must prepare for battle, Professor.

@Conversation 

Byleth: Someday, we'll take it back. 
Ferdinand: Thank you, Professor. I will not give in. Not until I have restored my noble pride!
Byleth: Taking it back would be difficult.
Ferdinand: Yes, I know it would be difficult, but I will not give in!




Byleth: I'm sure they're not...
Linhardt: If I were in charge, it's what I would do.
Byleth: Probably. 
Linhardt: I knew it. War makes people crazy, huh?



Caspar: The Airmid River separates the Empire and Alliance. It's the largest river in FÃ³dlan. Sometimes it'll flood when there's lots of rain, but... At least the land gets some extra water!


Byleth: Sounds like you're learning.
Byleth: Isn't that a little pessimistic? 


Byleth: No, it's not OK.
Dorothea: Makes sense. A commander running away would be terrible for morale.
Byleth: I wouldn't blame you. 
Dorothea: Really? If something happens, will you keep me safe?



Petra: If we can suppress this Myrddin, we can invade into the Empire, Right? I was in the Empire. Now I will be an enemy... I am having strange feelings. It is with ease that an ally turns into an enemy...



Felix: We have the Empire and Alliance situations under control. The problem is Faerghus. The eastern lords have joined forces and are warring with the Dukedom. But I've heard nothing about that conflict as of late. It's strange. I haven't heard much from my father either. I can't help but find this silence unsettling...



Ashe: It's thanks to you that I'm here now. I owe you, Professor. You saved my life. I swear I'll do all I can to repay that debt.



Sylvain: I had an encounter with Lord Gwendal... How many years ago was it? Back before the academy, I met this girl who I fell madly in love with...and her dad tried to kill me. I suppose he just tried to scare me, but I was sure I was gonna die. Oh yeah, her dad? Lord Gwendal. Crazy, right? I never thought I'd seriously be trying to kill the guy in battle. I kind of don't know how to make sense of it.



Mercedes: Lady Rhea is in the Empire, isn't she? We should hurry up and find her. So many people in the monastery and nearby towns are worried... I want to ease their minds as soon as possible, Professor. Let's work together to find her!



Annette: Next we face the Great Bridge of Myrddin... We actually crossed it a long time ago. Do you remember? It was five whole years ago!
Byleth: During the Battle of the Eagle and Lion? 
Annette: It seems like so long ago, doesn't it? It's odd how fast time flies...
Byleth: When we went to Remire Village?
Annette: What are you talking about, Professor? It was on the way to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion!
Annette: Everyone was still friends then. After the fighting, we all ate together without splitting into our separate houses. I often wish we could go back to those peaceful days...



Ingrid: So, that was Judith. Just as I'd heard of her, she was an upstanding person. The same Daphnel blood runs through my veins, and yet I feel as though I am nothing like her. I am but a phantom of what could be...
Byleth: You're actually quite alike. 
Ingrid: You think so? Wow, thank you!
Byleth: True, you do differ.
Ingrid: If only I could be even half of who she is.



Raphael: Thanks to all that food from Judith, I'm full for once! I've got so much energy! Let me at that Great Bridge of Myrddin! I'll bust it down myself! Oh, but then how do we cross?



Ignatz: The Great Bridge of Myrddin isn't just a bridge, It has the features of a fortress. I believe it was built for military purposes by the first leader of the Adrestian Empire. In other words, it's even older than the monastery. So if we occupy the Great Bridge, we'll have to search it from top to bottom.



Lysithea: I'm sure you know this already, but House Ordelia is aligned with the Empire. They face the Empire from across the river, similar to the Gloucesters. Even so, I refuse to yield to the Empire a second time. The Empire did unthinkable things to my family. And to me. The only option here is winning. Professor, you must promise we will overcome the Empire.



Marianne: Legend says that pillars of light fell and ravaged Ailell. I was reminded of that when I saw it... Up, Professor? Do you think those legends are true?
Byleth: It's likely.
Marianne: I think so too. I don't know if the goddess really destroyed the valley out of anger, but...
Byleth: Yes, and it'll likely happen again. 
Marianne: Oh! I suppose you may be right. There's no way to be sure it won't...
Marianne: There are still so many things we don't understand in this world.



Hilda: It looks like people are slowly starting to come back to the town. I guess they feel safe now that you and the Knights of Seiros have returned. Peddlers have become more common too, so there'll be food and supplies available. After being run-down for all those years, it's really becoming livable again!



Leonie: Things would have gotten a lot more interesting if Judith had joined us. I only spoke to her briefly, but I really liked her. I hope someday I can be as strong, kind, and levelheaded as her.



Seteth: If Rhea really is in the Empire, then we must defeat the Imperial army by any means necessary. The people at large are just as concerned for Rhea's safety as we are. The sooner we can settle all our unease, the better.



Flayn: Judith is a wonderful person. So strong and confident, as well. Looking upon her, I was sharply reminded of my mother.
Byleth: Did she look similar?
Flayn: Not in the slightest. Rather, it is her way of being--her demeanor. Brilliantly bright and positive, like a warm ray of light.
Byleth: Did she act similar? 
Flayn: Very much so! Both brilliantly bright and positive, like a warm ray of light.
Flayn: I...lost my mother, long ago. I miss her desperately.



Hanneman: The battle at Ailell was a tactical marvel. You grow stronger with each passing day. Where does you talent end and your Crest's power begin? Are they one and the same, I wonder? Most intriguing. Yet it is quite difficult to draw useful conclusions, given the situation. It is quite unfortunate I did not achieve my research goals before the war broke out. So much unknown. Now, I fear I will not have those answers even by conflict's end. So very frustrating.



Manuela: Oh, hello there, Professor. Did you need something from me? It doesn't look like you're wounded or anything. You just looking for...someone to talk to?
Byleth: Yes. 
Manuela: I thought so. Well, I'm here for you! Making you feel better is my top priority.
Byleth: No.
Manuela: Come on now, you don't have to be shy. Helping you feel better is important to me.
Manuela: Whether it's physical pain or worries of the heart, you can come to me for anything, Professor.



Alois: So, Lady Rhea was in the Empire all this time. Glad as I am that Judith told us, I wish we had known this five years ago. We spent all that time spread out over FÃ³dlan, searching for the archbishop and you. It was a mistake to abandon the monastery, to leave it in ruins. Now we're paying for that mistake.



Catherine: I'd heard of the Hero of Daphnel, but that was the first time I've met her in person. She's the head of a prestigious noble family? Just like Claude. The Alliance nobility is so...odd.
Byleth: You don't think she acts like a noble?
Byleth: Is it different in the Kingdom and Empire? 
Catherine: Kind of, but I don't mean that in a bad way. You won't find such big-hearted nobles elsewhere. Plus, Judith can drink with the best of'em! A woman after my own heart.



Shamir: Five years ago, when the Imperial army attacked Garreg Mach, they moved with incredible speed. But in the middle of all that chaos, she still had operatives watching. The Hero of Daphnel's spy network is impressive. She shouldn't be taken lightly.



Cyril: Is it true Lady Rhea was dragged off by the Imperial army? I heard that was true. Why'd they take Lady Rhea? Professor...they didn't take her to kill her, did they?
Byleth: I don't think so.
Cyril: That's good. We just gotta beat the Imperial army and get her back, right?
Byleth: They probably haven't killed her.
Cyril: Yeah, good point. If they did, we'd have heard about it by now.
Cyril: You gotta help her, Professor. I'm begging ya.



Anna: There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Oh! I heard what happened at Ailell. I can't believe Imperial spies have been lurking in Garreg Mach! Under my watch! But I'll make sure no more of 'em get in, trust me!

@Intro 
Seteth: This is the Great Bridge of Myrddin, one of the bridges that cuts across the Airmid River between the Empire and the Alliance. Its defenses have been fortified since I last was here. It seems the enemy is sufficiently prepared.
Byleth: Let's end this quickly. 
Manuela: That's the idea, Professor. Let's make this quick and painless. So much that it's over before they even know it's started.
Byleth: Steady now. 
Hanneman: If they are fully equipped, we must prepare ourselves for anything. We must be ready to change our approach in an instant.
Seteth: Yes, that is most sound. I do not distrust Claude, but there is no guarantee that the other Alliance lords will not move against us. Onward, with caution.
Ferdinand: After we cross the Great Bridge, the greatest plains in FÃ³dlan will be before us. You do remember, do you not? I speak of Gronder Field, where we fought the Battle of the Eagle and Lion.
Caspar: The ones defending the Great Bridge... It isn't my father or brother, is it? I really want to finish this battle without seeing them. Especially my father...
Linhardt: Yes, I hear your father can fell a bear without even a weapon in hand. When we run into him, I'll be sure to let you take the lead. Family matters, and all.
Caspar: That's not funny, you jerk!
Petra: Should we be burning the signal of uprising?
Dorothea: There's no need for that, Petra. Smoke or no smoke, they'll get the idea. Losing the bridge should be a pretty big clue.
Bernadetta: Oh no! I can't believe we're actually going to invade! If Edelgard...gets angry... Oh, I get nervous just picturing it! Stop that, imagination! Oh, and if she destroys the monastery with her army, we're all gonna die!
Seteth: The hour of questioning has long since passed. I assure you, whatever happens, this will not end as it did five years ago. Back then, the Empire was able to focus its entire army on Garreg Mach. Now their front lines are stretched thin along their borders with both the Kingdom and the Alliance. Their allies have grown in number, but so have their enemies. They should not have too many soldiers they can readily send our way. Now then, let us set forth! This shall be the first step in ending the chaos that has engulfed this realm!

@Opening 
Sights set on Enbarr, the resistance army avoids the Oghma Mountains, choosing instead to move south along the eastern route that passes through the Alliance. To make it safely through the territory of House Gloucester - supporters of the Empire - the army seeks help from the head of House Riegan, Claude. Claude vows to draw away House Gloucester's troops so that the resistance army can advance to the Airmid River - a dividing line between the Alliance and the Empire.

After fending off the Empire, your forces decide it's time to advance. But first, you must capture the Great Bridge of Myrddin, a strategic crossing point over the Airmid River, which borders the Alliance and the Empire.

@Battle 
Ladislava: That symbol... It's an enemy raid! Stay calm and face them head-on. Send a messenger to Acheron immediately! If we're quick, we might be able to pull off a pincer attack!
Seteth: That is Ladislava. She has, of late, made quite a name for herself as a general. Be on your guard.

Seteth: We will control this fortress if we can eliminate all the enemies within it.
Imperial Soldier: Enemies approaching! Get the soldiers standing by to join the fight! We may need to hurry up preparations of the ballista too. Protect the fortress!


Imperial Soldier: You think we'll let you take this bridge form us
Seteth: It appears enemy soldiers are stationed in the fortress. More will come. Stay on your guard!

Lorenz: I, Lorenz Hellman Gloucester, have arrived to join the battle in my father's stead! 
Alliance General: We'll ally ourselves with the Imperial soldiers too! 
Ladislava: Thanks for making your way here. Annihilate the enemy with the rest of them!


Ladislava: Acheron! Now's the time to show your loyalty to the Empire! Attack the enemy from behind!
Acheron: I've got to make her name known to Her Majesty through distinguished service.
Seteth: That is Acheron, a minor Alliance noble. If he has allied with the Empire, then we must destroy him.

@End 
Seteth: Goddess, please forgive the sins of the enemy leaders and the brave soldiers who followed their orders.

Seteth: Somehow we managed to capture the Great Bridge of Myrddin. To see the Imperial Army hold its ground until every last soldier fell... That is true dedication. It is clear that Edelgard is not some cruel emperor who holds her people in a vice-like grip. There is something more driving our foes. From here on out, our journey will not be an easy one...

Church Soldier: Excuse me, sir! Gilbert is here!
Seteth: Gilbert?! What was he doing all this time? We had better go and meet with him.



Gilbert: So you've captured the Great Bridge of Myrddin. I'm impressed you were able to break through their defenses.
Seteth: Save your praise, Gilbert. Let's get to the heart of the matter. Why are you here? Why now?
Gilbert: I am once again in the service of Dimitri. He was in hiding in Fraldarius territory, where he was biding his time for a counteroffensive.
Seteth: Dimitri is alive?!
Gilbert: Yes. He was to be executed in Fhirdiad, but Dedue stepped forward to rescue him. I am here today by command of Dimitri himself. We realize that our enemies are the same...and that it may be advantageous to join forces.
Seteth: I see. I shall hear you out.
Gilbert: We are preparing to advance against the Empire. Will you join us as we march toward the Imperial capital? If that is too much to ask, then at least allow us to freely cross the Great Bridge of Myrddin.
Byleth: We will join you.
Seteth: Hold a moment. We have just finished a fierce battle, and our forces are few.
Byleth: You may cross freely.
Seteth: Agreed. We have just finished a fierce battle, and our forces are few.
Seteth: To march straight for the main body of the Imperial army and challenge them? It is too soon. I am happy yo allow you safe passage over the bridge, but to lend our aid asks too much of us. Is that not so? If you would be willing to wait a few months, we might be able to offer something more.
Gilbert: I am afraid His Highness is not able to stop his advance...
Seteth: If that is the case, I am afraid we cannot join you. Please, send our regards to Dimitri.
Gilbert: I understand. It's unfortunate that we were not able to secure the help of the Knights of Seiros. Still, I'm grateful that we can cross the Great Bridge of Myrddin safely. Thank you for that. This will be a fight to the death. It is highly likely that we will meet our end. I wish you both the best of luck in the battles ahead.
Seteth: And may the goddess protect you as well.

@Opening 
Following Edelgard's defeat and Rhea's rescue, the resistance army discovers the existence of another adversary-a group operating behind the scenes within the Empire.To prevent disaster from befalling FÃ³dlan, the resistance army heads for Shambhala, the enemy's stronghold.

@Dialogue 
Seteth: The Empire has been defeated, and we have rescued Rhea. But still, the flames of war burn on. We journey to Shambhala, where those who slither in the dark reside.
Flayn: We know nothing of the place or what we can expect to find there.
Seteth: What Flayn says is true. If we are to prevail, we must be prepared for any eventuality before we advance.
Rhea: I will accompany you.
Seteth: What?! No! That would be far too dangerous! Your long confinement weakened you greatly, did it not?
Rhea: Those people have opposed us since ancient times. I wish to learn the truth about them for myself.
Seteth: I...I understand. I will not stop you, but please take care not to overexert yourself.
Bernadetta: What?! But she's been hiding away so long! She shouldn't just up and go somewhere scary. Trust me, it's a bad idea!
Linhardt: Bernadetta, "hiding away" seems a poor description for someone who was imprisoned.
Ferdinand: We must be careful not to put undue stress on Lady Rhea.
Caspar: If the going gets tough, we'll have to carry her on our backs and make a run for it!
Dorothea: You think you can carry her? Um, maybe someone else should do that part...
Petra: No matter what enemies are appearing, we will be protecting her. We will be winning!
Flayn: If we work together, I am certain all will be well...
Seteth: The ones we are soon to face have eluded us for a long time. There is much to fear... We must all proceed with utmost caution, lest we fall prey to one of their traps.

@Conversation 
Ferdinand: The history of the Empire spans 1185 years. And just like that, it ends. But the Hresvelg legacy could live on... When Edelgard assumed power, there were no other rightful heirs. She said that whoever takes the throne next should do so by the virtue of merit, not blood. And she truly meant what she said. At any rate... I feel that a huge hole has opened up in my heart. Who knows if it can ever be filled?



Linhardt: As history proves, everything comes to an end eventually. I knew that all along, but it still came as a surprise. Those who slither in the dark... It's all so fascinating and strange. They must certainly have a long history of their own. And when they fall, that will come quickly too. Don't you think? Heh, that almost sounded like a prophecy there. Am I spooking you yet?



Caspar: He's dead... My father's dead... I'm OK though. Really. I was ready for it. He was a general in the Imperial army, after all. Minister of Military Affairs... He gave his own life so the Empire's soldiers wouldn't have to lose theirs. That's a fight that only he could take on. He was such a tough guy. I fought side by side with you this whole time. But did I ever get any stronger? Will I ever be as strong as my father?

Bernadetta: With Edelgard gone, maybe FÃ³dlan will finally find some peace. That's all well and good, but, um... She was also the one to put my father under house arrest, so now he's been released, and he's taken charge of House Varley. I can't handle it! I can't deal with him! Please, you have to do something!
Byleth: How about we exile him? 
Byleth: We can put him back under arrest.
Bernadetta: Thank you so much!



Dorothea: So, the moment we defeat Edie, the nobles cozy up to the Alliance and the Church... That lot really does think only of themselves, and no one else. But then there's Count Bergliez. He used to be Minister of Military Affairs... He sacrificed his own life so that all the soldiers and officers who fought could be given quarter... When I heard that... I don't know... that simple act of humanity... I couldn't help it. I burst into tears. You know Count Bergliez is Caspar's father, right? I can't even imagine how Caspar must feel about it.



Petra: The Empire has broken in... in smithereens. Now it is possible for me to go back to Brigid. But... I cannot choose that choice. The time is still too soon for that. We must be stopping the evil for everyone in FÃ³dlan. We will be fighting until the end of it!



Felix: I thought that after the Empire fell, the boar might finally be avenged... But something dark is certainly lurking in the shadows - an organization behind the Empire. We'll have to take care of them if the boar... if Dimitri is to rest in peace.



Ashe: I've only ever done what I thought was just. I've got no regrets, but sometimes I do wonder if I've done the right thing. Was all this really for the best? Sorry - thinking about the end of the war makes me reconsider all kinds of things. But it's not over yet, is it? I need to steel myself for the next battle.



Sylvain: This war might be over but not war in general. Human beings thrive on conflict. We can't get enough of it. I don't know when, but you know someday another war will begin.
Byleth: Even so... 
Sylvain: Heh heh... That's the way it is, right?
Byleth: You're probably right on that.
Sylvain: Yeah, but the fight is still worth it.
Sylvain: War may always come back but so will peace. And peace is what we fight for.



Mercedes: Lady Rhea still seems weak... but at least she's safe now. I'm praying that she'll be well as soon as possible. Goddess... I beg you... Protect Lady Rhea!



Annette: Finally, that awful war is over. Everyone lost something, and everyone had to make sacrifices... But maybe we can put a stop to all of this pain and loss now. Let's hurry to Shambhala, Professor! We have to defeat them if we ever want to see a world without war.



Ingrid: Is it really prudent to bring Lady Rhea on our upcoming expedition? It would be best not to have her doing anything strenuous, considering how long she was confined...
Byleth: It's her decision, ultimately. 
Byleth: I feel similarly.
Ingrid: There are still many in FÃ³dlan who are seeking Lady Rhea's salvation. For their sake, we cannot put her in harm's way.



Lorenz: A mysterious power threatening the very future of FÃ³dlan? Certainly we cannot give it leeway. Right now, the Empire, the Kingdom, and even the Alliance no longer exist. There is only FÃ³dlan - and FÃ³dlan must fight together as one!
Byleth: Aren't you frightened? 
Lorenz: Fear will serve no purpose here. The only path to survival now is victory.
Byleth: Do you think we can defeat it?
Lorenz: There is simply no option but victory! The alternative is unthinkable.
Lorenz: Perhaps I will have the opportunity to strike the decisive blow on the enemy commander. That would secure my place in history for certain!



Raphael: Wake up, eat, train, eat, train, eat, sleep. We gotta prepare for the assault, but that hasn't changed my routine!
Byleth: You're doing plenty. 
Byleth: Isn't there more you can do?
Raphael: All the training... and eating... I do is for the sake of FÃ³dlan! Gotta stay strong... and fed... to keep it safe!



Ignatz: Our next opponent is an ally of Solon. Do you remember what Solon called us?
Byleth: Traitors?
Ignatz: No. He called us beasts.
Byleth: Beasts? 
Ignatz: That's right. He called us beasts.
Byleth: Insects?
Ignatz: No. He called us beasts.
Ignatz: Meanwhile, he refers to himself as the Savior. Who exactly is he saving?



Lysithea: Those who slither in the dark... It seems we'll finally discover their true form. I get the sense that they're in league with the mages who experimented on me as a child. I wouldn't be surprised if Edelgard was subjected to them too. There's no telling what their true motives are. But whatever their motives, what they have done is unforgivable. They must be exterminated.



Marianne: I thought the war would end with Edelgard's defeat... But that wasn't the case. This may be premature, but I'm feeling a little relieved. I'll have to consider what I'll do with myself and where I'll go when this war is finally over... I don't have an answer yet... Let's make sure the next battle puts an end to this war. That way we can all move forward!



Hilda: Shambhala it was called, right? Scary that it's so close to the House Goneril territories. Who'd have thought all those creeps were living under my nose? I was hoping my big brother would help us in the next battle. But he says that I can represent House Goneril without his help. That I have it in me. I'm glad he recognizes that I have some ability. Still, I wish he wasn't leaving it all to me.



Leonie: These are Monica's people, aren't they? The ones who killed Captain Jeralt. Then this is my real opportunity for revenge. There's no way I can back down from this one.
Byleth: You're not scared? 
Leonie: No, I'm OK. Actually, I'm eager to get out there and fight. This is what I've been training for.
Byleth: I wonder if we can win.
Leonie: If we lose, it's the end for FÃ³dlan. So we have to win, even if it kills us.



Seteth: Rhea is sleeping right now. If it is not absolutely urgent, please do not disturb her rest. The long confinement took its toll on her health. Truthfully, she is in no shape to be exerting herself at all - to say nothing of a military expedition. To make matters worse, we are now facing a very old enemy. One that has conspired against us since time out of mind. Please proceed with caution. I have a bad feeling.



Flayn: I am so glad that Rhea is unharmed. My brother continues to worry about her, however. Of course, I am worried myself. I cannot imagine being in that situation while in such a state... I hope she will rest now and leave it up to you and my brother to see things through.



Hanneman: A mysterious organization, slithering in the dark of FÃ³dlan... Like something out of a midnight tale. It appears these fiends have infiltrated the deepest corners of the Empire. After the fall of Enbarr, they've remained well concealed... That said, I would keep an eye on Edelgard's uncle, Lord Arundel. Something about him sits ill with me.



Manuela: Professor! I just got word from the opera company. I don't know if everyone survived, but it looks like they should be able to mount a revival. They even asked if I'd consider making a return to the stage someday... I suspect I may refuse though. We're at the dawn of something new. No reason to look backwards, eh?



Alois: You've done it. You did it. You crushed the Empire, and rescued Lady Rhea. I'm sure the captain is proud of you right now. As am I, of course! I'm as proud as if I'd done it myself!
Byleth: Let's not celebrate just yet. 
Byleth: We still have opponents left to fight.
Alois: Sorry I didn't mean to overdo it. We still have to deal with Monica's group... Those who killed the captain. We'll knock 'em down so hard that they can't get back up!



Catherine: We rescued Lady Rhea! I can hardly express my joy. But now we know about a new foe, who intends to bring her harm. In time, we'll realize the peaceful world that Lady Rhea has always hoped for. I'll have to keep that in mind when I'm fighting.



Shamir: We saved Rhea and the Empire has crumbled. The Kingdom may as well be finished too. The reasons for me to remain in FÃ³dlan are fading.
Byleth: Please, stay with us a little longer. 
Shamir: Of course. I've come this far. May as well see it through to the end.
Byleth: Is it time to bid farewell?
Shamir: That's a little hasty. I've come this far. May as well see it through the end.



Cyril: Lady Rhea's back! Lady Rhea's back! I'm so happy! But... things aren't gonna be like they used to be any time soon, are they? There's still folks out there that want us all dead, and Lady Rhea still hasn't regained her strength yet. Speaking of which, Professor, please don't ask too much of her right now, OK?



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! I can hardly believe you managed to handle the capital city like that. Everyone did sterling work! I really thought we'd know peace after that battle. But we're not quite there yet, huh?

@Opening 
Relying on a map entrusted to them by Hubert, the resistance army sets their sights on the base belonging to those who slither in the dark. Beyond its entrance, they are met by a sprawling underground city.

Though the flame of war is quenched, its embers endure. You travel deep underground to confront those who slither in the dark and bring lasting peace to FÃ³dlan.

@Intro 
Flayn: To think there is such a vast space hidden beneath the ground. How very creepy.
Linhardt: Hmm, the atmosphere here is very different from the Holy Mausoleum or the Holy Tomb. Look at the shapes and the light...
Caspar: It's too strange... It's all really old, but you get the feeling that it's also...new? I don't understand it.
Petra: This decorating is not of FÃ³dlan... What is the meaning here?
Dorothea: I hate the look of things in here. Is this some kind of city? I would never, ever live here.
Bernadetta: Living underground...all safe and isolated... It sounds really... Um! Really awful!
Ferdinand: An underground city hiding those who slither in the dark. I would not mind finishing up here and returning to the surface with haste.
Seteth: Let us search for a way to descend further still. We should survey our surroundings carefully.

Rhea: ...
Byleth: Something on your mind?
Byleth: Are you not feeling well?
Rhea: No. It is simply... We must defeat those who slither in the dark, no matter what happens. But if my conjecture is correct, the one who they will wish to kill the most...

Rhea: Is you, dear child.
Byleth: Why me?
Rhea: They are aware that you can use the Sword of the Creator. Your body houses the same power they once bestowed upon Nemesis. That is why I must protect you, no matter what. Even if I must die to do so...
Byleth: I don't understand.
Rhea: Somewhere in your heart, I believe you do understand. You must at least have your suspicions. There is something I have not yet told you, dear child... I swear to illuminate you once this awful battle has concluded. And at the same time... I will offer my apologies to you. I must, because...when you learn the truth, you will also learn what you are, and how you were born into this world. It will be a hard truth to hear. When the time comes, I hope you are prepared for it...

@Battle 
Thales: For thousands of years, we have existed underground, living on only that we might someday see our vengeance realized. Here and now, that vengeance is finally within our grasp. There is but one thing left to do. Destroy them! Damn those who stand with that arrogant goddess to oblivion, away from the world of the living!

Thales: Now is the time. Remove the binding spell of Titanus. Let their metal bodies be drenched in blood!
Seteth: What is that?!

Rhea: Demonic Beasts... No, I think not. They appear to have no will of their own. Someone must be controlling them.
Thales: Initiate all that remain! We must advance our preparations!

Thales: Viskam has been activated? Increase output gradually, depending on the amount of magical energy charged. I don't care if we destroy Shambhala, as long as our goals are fulfilled!

Seteth: They're trying to take something out of here. We should capture them before they escape.

Seteth: More of these giant weapons?! They must be controlled by someone nearby. That facility over there seems suspicious.

Rhea: Those awful weapons have been stopped. They were being controlled from that facility!

Seteth: Finally, they've stopped! That should make things easier.

Thales: You!
Rhea: That is the leader of those who slither in the dark. We must go after him with all our might!
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
It is Imperial Year 1185. Nearly five years have passed since the fall of the monastery at Garreg Mach, and war continues to plague the lands of FÃ³dlan. Fhirdiad has been captured. The Holy Kingdom of Faerghus is in shambles. The Leicester Alliance is on the verge of collapse, fractured by two opposing factionsâthose who support the Adrestian Empire and its ruler, and those who seek her demise. Meanwhile, under Emperor Edelgardâs rule of law, the Adrestian Empire continues to expand its reach. The path to a new FÃ³dlan, unified by Imperial strength, may yet be in sight.

@Dialogue 
Edelgard: *sighs* Why am I even here? I know they won't come, but here I am anyway. How has it already been five years? Time stops for no one, I suppose.

Edelgard: Huh? It's-- It's you! What are you doing here?
Byleth: I came here for you.
Edelgard: For me?
Byleth: I'm not sure myself.
Byleth: A whim.
Edelgard: Highly doubtful. So you were alive. What have you been doing all this time?
Byleth: I was sleeping.
Byleth: I was dead.
Edelgard: Joking at a time like this. Well if you don't wish to tell me, I won't persuade you. All that matters is this: Will you return to the Empire with me?
Edelgard: Before you answer, know that friends from our Black Eagle days have chosen to join me in the fight ahead.
Byleth: I...
Edelgard: Hesitation. It betrays your true answer.
Byleth: I can't.
Edelgard: As expected. I knew your answer before I had even asked the question.
Edelgard: That means... we're enemies now, you and I. My teacher, the time for discussion has come to an end.

@Cutscene 
Edelgard: Even though our swords may cross as they do now--

Edelgard: --there's no denying that our chosen paths never will.

Edelgard: Goodbye, my teacher. When next we meet, one of us will breath their last.

@Intro 
Seteth: Who is it?! Is that-- It's you!

Byleth: It's been a long time. 
Seteth: Yes, it has been! But this is no time for casual chatter!
Byleth: What are you doing here?
Seteth: I was going to ask you the very same thing.
Seteth: After you disappeared five years ago, do you have any idea how dire the church's situation became? Where were you, and what were you doing all of those years?
Byleth: I was sleeping.

Seteth: You slept for five years... In that case, I suppose there is nothing more to say. You should know that Rhea also disappeared after the battle at Garreg Mach five years ago. Since then, the knights have been fully devoted to searching for her. They have yet to find a trace.
Byleth: Was she captured by the Imperial army?
Byleth: Was she murdered by the Imperial army?
Seteth: It is possible. However, the Empire has not made any such statement as of yet. Even if that were the truth, there is no way for us to confirm. We have searched all over, but we have reached an impasse. Unless we do something, our efforts to find Rhea and rebuild the Church will be stalled indefinitely. Our opportunity to strike back is close at hand. Sadly, we are short on military strength. However, now we have you. Do you recall what Rhea told you five years ago? She asked for you to take her place should anything ever happen to her. She entrusted you with leading the people of FÃ³dlan.
Byleth: I remember.
Seteth: Then I beg of you, please, heed her words.
Byleth: I can't do that.
Seteth: I will not accept that. Please... you must lend me your strength.
Seteth: It is up to you to lead us and to defeat the Empire-- no, to defeat Edelgard.
Byleth: Why me?
Seteth: There is a very good reason...but it is not yet time to divulge it. Just know that without you, we have no hope.
Byleth: You should lead them.
Seteth: It is not for me to do. You are the only one who can rise to this task. Someday, you will know why that is. Until then, I ask that you trust me.
Byleth: I don't want to fight Edelgard.
Seteth: What are you saying? She is tormenting all of FÃ³dlan! And you are the only one who can save us! How can you not see that?!
Church Soldier: Sir! Bandits have entered the area! They stole some hidden weapons and ran off! They're heading for the town, so that might be where they're hiding out...
Seteth: Vile thieves! Even with the knights gone, I cannot believe they would dare trespass here! This is unforgivable! Come, Professor. Let us give chase!

@Opening 
In the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, Imperialist loyalist Cornelia has subdued all regions of the former royal house of Blaiddyd to prevent further revolt. Prince Dimitri has been sentenced. Now, the backbone of the former KingdomâHouses Gautier and Fraldariusâstruggle to continue the resistance. Corneliaâoperating out of the royal palaceâhas accepted the support of the Empire to build an army and plots to wipe out all remaining Kingdom forces.

In the Leicester Alliance, House Riegan leads an anti-Imperial faction, while House Gloucester directs the Empireâs supporters. Despite the undeniable threat of fracture, the Allianceâs adept new leader, Claude, deftly maintains the outward appearance of a unified front.

In Enbarr, the Imperial Capital of the Adrestian Empire, Emperor Edelgard fights to strengthen her regime. She has extended her reach to the Kingdom by inciting a coup and continues to draw its former lords under her influence in pursuit of controlling all of western FÃ³dlan.

In the meantime, the Knights of Seiros have been dispatched to find Archbishop Rhea, who remains missing despite their searching. Left unattended, the monastery at Garreg Mach has fallen to ruin...and become a haven for thieves.

@Battle 
Seteth: Looters deserve no forgiveness! After them!
PallardÃ³: What the... Intruders! Protect the goods!

Seteth: Stop the thieves! Retrieve our stolen goods!

Dorothea: We had no place to go so we came back to Garreg Mach. But then -- Huh? Professor?
Caspar: Looks like there's a fight! I'm ready to join the battle!
Petra: It is confirmed that Professor is alive. I will be...cooperating.
Seteth: What are you doing here?! Never mind, we'll have to talk later! Help us with these thieves!

Bernadetta: People? A battle?! Oh, there wasn't supposed to be anyone here! Wait, is that... Professor?!
Linhardt: Professor... You're alive after all. Well then, I am quite pleased with my choice to come here.
Ferdinand: Professor?! Never mind... We have to focus on winning this fight!
Seteth: Lend us a hand! Let's beat them back!

Seteth: If we split our troops in two, we can attack from the north and the south to trap their leader.

@Battle-Talk 
%Byleth,Dorothea
Dorothea: Do you remember our promise from five years ago, Professor? Today's the day.

%Byleth,Caspar
Caspar: I'm so glad I get to see you again, Professor!

%Byleth,Petra
Petra: I went back to Brigid once...but I had to be returning to FÃ³dlan. 

%Byleth,Ferdinand
Ferdinand: Ah, Professor. You have not changed a bit. I am so glad to fight alongside you again.

%Byleth,Linhardt
Linhardt: So what have you been doing these past five years? Sleeping?! Why, I must say I'm a bit envious.

%Byleth,Bernadetta
Bernadetta: Took all my will to come out here today. But seeing you again, Professor? That's worth a little torture! 

@Boss
PallardÃ³: No! I'm not the one you want! Gah! I guess I've got no choice.

PallardÃ³: It isn't looking good for us. Should we retreat?
Seteth: He has some treasure from the monastery too! Do not let him escape!

@End 
Seteth: It seems we were able to expel the bandits who were hiding in Garreg Mach. How fortuitous that you students should gather at the monastery like this...
Dorothea: We made a promise with the professor. That was five years ago to the very day.
Petra: We all gave our promise to be meeting here when the millennium festival arrived.
Linhardt: Though the one who came up with that plan is not here... Edelgard. Still, how incredible that those present gathered despite the terrible state of things...
Caspar: Pfft, the most incredible part of it is that you didn't oversleep and miss the reunion!
Seteth: So, that is the reason... Professor. The monastery is safe because of your devoted students. I am now fully convinced you are the only one who can save FÃ³dlan.
Byleth: That's taking it a bit far.
Seteth: No, not so.
Byleth: You can count on me.
Seteth: Ah, so you have finally accepted your destiny.
Seteth: On the very day I return to Garreg Mach, you awaken and return as well. This is no mere coincidence but, rather, the work of the goddess.
Byleth: What's your reason for being here?
Seteth: Actually... Well, it would be easier to just show you. Come with me to the Holy Mausoleum. I realize that since you have been slumbering for so long, you have no idea what has transpired in the various territories. Allow me to explain... After the Battle of Garreg Mach, there was a change of regime in the Kingdom. House Blaiddyd suffered a series of brutal massacres, which claimed the lives of Dimitri and Regent Rufus. The Kingdom capital fell and was absorbed into the Empire as the Faerghus Dukedom, which is now under Cornelia's control. Some still resist the Empire. As of now, Rodrigue of House Fraldarius is at the center of such efforts. In the Alliance, Claude leads the faction that opposes the Empire, and Lorenz leads those who have sided with them. The front lines are ever in motion, but the war effort has stagnated overall. In short, both the Kingdom and the Alliance have been swallowed up by the Empire and are on the verge of collapse. We must gather our generals and soldiers under your command and reverse this dire situation.

Seteth: Flayn, look! The professor has returned to us!
Flayn: Hm? What do you mean... Oh! Goodness! It really IS you, Professor! I cannot believe you are still of this world! We were so worried we would never see you again.
Byleth: What are you doing here?
Flayn: I forgot something important at the Holy Mausoleum... I told my brother I had to go back for it no matter what, and so here I am...
Seteth: After we finished here, we were going to continue our search for Rhea. But now that you are here, things have changed. We must not waste this opportunity. We shall send word to the knights scattered all across the land. The time has come for the Knights of Seiros to return to action. We are counting on you, Professor!
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
After seizing the Great Bridge of Myrddin, the resistance army starts making preparations to invade Imperial territory, when a surprising piece of information comes to light.

@Dialogue 
Church Soldier: Emergency! In Gronder Field... There's a... It's...
Seteth: We are in the middle of a military conference. Please calm yourself and tell us what is the matter.
Church Soldier: Yes, sir! It seems that the Kingdom and Alliance armies clashed with Imperial forces on Gronder Field! Amid the chaos of three armies battling each other out there, the Imperial army was routed! Edelgard sustained heavy wounds and retreated to Enbarr!
Seteth: Well then! I suppose...
Church Soldier: Sir! The Kingdom army was also decimated and... His Highness, Dimitri, has been counted among the dead.
Seteth: What?!
Church Soldier: The Alliance sustained heavy casualties as well. And the whereabouts of their leader, Claude, is currently unknown.
Seteth: Unknown? I...
Byleth: Edelgard is injured...
Byleth: Dimitri is dead...
Byleth: Claude is missing...
Seteth: It must have been a brutal fight. To have lost His Highness... How tragic. Our only solace is that Edelgard sustained severe injuries. This is all quite unexpected, but we must find a way to use this situation to our advantage. The Empire's main force has suffered a mighty blow. Edelgard will most certainly avoid the front lines. Now is the time for us to infiltrate the Empire and aim for the capital.
Flayn: But...what will happen to the lords of the old Kingdom and Alliance territories?
Seteth: They have lost many leaders and soldiers. I am sure they must be hard at work rebuilding. We will foster cooperation by aiding them through the local churches. The remaining lords of the Kingdom and Alliance must join together to form one union. And you should be the one to lead them... What do you say?
Byleth: In time... 
Byleth: I can't decide that just yet.
Seteth: Indeed. It is a question for another day. We must focus on our battle with the Empire. For now, what is our next course of action?
Byleth: We should set out.
Byleth: Let's decide where to invade first. 
Seteth: We must choose a place within the Empire that will give us solid defenses for our front line... That will become the foothold for our invasion of the capital. There is one massive fortress that boasts the greatest defenses in the Empire...Fort Merceus. But we will stand no chance if we attack by traditional means. We must gather everyone and devise a plan of attack.


Dimitri: ... It has been a lifetime... Hasn't it, Professor?
Byleth:  I thought you were dead.
Dimitri: Yes... I thought so too. I wanted to slice her throat...but I did not get the chance. I let people die, and yet... I still stand. Rodrigue, Gustave, Dedue...
Byleth: There must be a reason you survived.
Dimitri: You sound just like Rodrigue. A reason...
Byleth: You can still atone for your sins.
Dimitri: You sound just like Rodrigue. A way to absolve my sins...
Dimitri: Everyone gives such complicated advice, and I can never quite grasp it all. That is why... Professor. I came here to explain my decision.
Byleth: What decision?
Dimitri: I have no resources to take back the Kingdom capital, much less to defeat the Empire. And that is why...
Seteth: Professor! You will catch a cold sleeping in a place like this. Is something the matter?
Byleth: Where did he go?
Seteth: Hm? I am the only one here. Were you dreaming?
Byleth: ...
Seteth: I can't say for certain that you were dreaming, but if someone did come here to see you... That person only wanted you to see their face. Perhaps they wanted you to guide them...

@Conversation 
Ferdinand: Dimitri, the late prince of Faerghus. He despised the Empire with all his heart. He should not have tried leading an army while his emotions were holding him captive.
Byleth: Leaders are people too.
Byleth: Don't leaders have feelings, like everyone else? 
Ferdinand: True enough, but I suspect the reason he died is that he could not keep his emotions in check. I see. You are saying you met with Dimitri? But you could not tell if it was reality or a dream. Hm. I wonder what it could mean.



Linhardt: I'm rather curious to see what stratagem we'll devise to capture the fortress. You know Fort Merceus's nickname, I assume. The Stubborn Old General? But there must be one or two gaps in its defenses...



Caspar: Fort Merceus is next, huh? Ah, the memories. It's a huge stronghold in my father's domain. The town's completely surrounded by high walls. I used to run around there when I was a kid... Way back when a fortress was a playground for me. Yeah, those were the days.

Bernadetta: It's always so peaceful coming back here. But it's hard to relax knowing we have to go out on another expedition again so soon. And assaulting that huge keep? That sounds hard. Oh, really, hard! Don't you think it'll be hard?!
Byleth: It's going to be tough. 
Bernadetta: I knew you'd think so! I knew you-- Ow! Oh, ow. Can't believe I tried to hug you through the door...
Byleth: We'll be fine.
Bernadetta: Of course you'd say that! Why'd I even ask?!



Dorothea: I heard that a staggering number of people lost their loves in the battle at Gronder. And here we are, preparing for the next battle, as if nothing happened the day before. It's almost easier to think about war as theater, with the stage an entire continent.
Byleth: Though actors die, the show goes on? 
Dorothea: Something like that. If an accident happens on stage, the next day's performance must be unaffected.
Byleth: It really doesn't seem like theater.
Dorothea: Even if an accident happens on stage, the next day you have to sing as though nothing happened.
Dorothea: Everyone just pretends like everything is fine... focusing on their role in the play.



Petra: I have excitement in my heart for secret tactics! I enjoy attacks that are surprising.
Byleth: Why's that?
Petra: Surprise attacks are safe with friends. Fewer injuries.
Byleth: Because it's like hunting? 
Petra: Yes. Hunting is doing surprise attacks on prey. Surprise attacks are safe with friends. Fewer injuries.



Felix: It hasn't sunk in yet. They slaughtered the boar... I can hardly believe it. I thought he was alive all this time. He must have really hated Edelgard to lead such an ill-advised assault. Hmph. No point in feeling sorry for the poor scoundrel now.



Ashe: I've heard Dedue's passed on. Just like His Highness.
Byleth: We can't know that for certain.
Ashe: That's true. I did hear that his body was never found.
Byleth: Don't believe everything you hear. 
Ashe: You're right. I don't think anyone's found his body, so I guess he might still be out there.
Byleth: Dedue is dead?
Ashe: That's what I've heard. But no one's found his body.
Ashe: If, somehow, he's still alive...I hope we'll meet again.



Sylvain: Ya know, Professor, laying siege to a keep is like asking a girl out on a date. First, you get past her defenses...then you make your move.
Byleth: That's not the best analogy.
Sylvain: Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. I'm a seasoned veteran at this kind of thing. Girls, I mean . I've never actually, you know, captured any keeps...
Byleth: You might be right. 
Sylvain: Ha! I knew you'd get it, Professor.
Sylvain: Anyway, you know more about tactics than me, so I don't know why I'm offering you advice.



Mercedes: Oh, Goddess, hear my prayer. Please bless the deceased with peace everlasting... And may his soul rest in tranquility. You know, I used to see him praying quite often when I would come to the cathedral at night. I wonder who it was he prayed for back then...



Annette: Professor. They tell me my father died at Gronder. Was that... Was that really a fitting end for one such as him? I don't know. I just...don't know.



Ingrid: I only know what little I overheard. But what I did hear implied that the Empire was involved in the Tragedy of Duscur. If it's true, that may explain why His Highness chose to fight the Empire. Perhaps I should have fought alongside His Highness.
Byleth: Why is that?
Ingrid: Because...I too, lost someone to that tragedy--the most important person in my world.
Byleth: Are you having regrets? 
Ingrid: No. Not anymore. I am where I belong.
Ingrid: Those of us still on this plane of existence will carry on the torch. The inhumane actions of the Empire must not be repeated.



Lorenz: Fort Merceus is old and strong. It's reputation for durability is equal to that of Arianrhod. Are you certain your plan is sufficient? It seems to be a little simplistic.
Byleth: Guess we'll find out. 
Lorenz: That's not terrifically reassuring! Shouldn't you have more faith in your own plans?!
Byleth: We'll be fine.
Lorenz: I suppose I must take you at your word, mustn't I?
Lorenz: Incidentally, have you heard any news of Claude? I, for one, have a hard time believing he is dead. He was always a clever and tenacious sort.



Raphael: You know when you work your muscles and they start screaming? That means you gotta be nice to them. If you're muscles are hungry, you gotta feed them, and let them rest when they're tired.
Byleth: I don't see how you'd do that.
Raphael: Whaddya mean, how? You just gotta eat and sleep! It's pretty obvious...
Byleth: You can tell how your muscles are feeling? 
Raphael: Of course! If my muscles hurt, then I hurt. If they're hungry, well then I'm hungry too!
Raphael: What's with the confused face, Professor? You look like you don't get a word I'm saying!



Ignatz: It sounds like the battle at Gronder Field was pretty gruesome. We don't know for certain whether Claude's alive or dead. Maybe he's all right? I wish I could make sure somehow. But it doesn't seem possible now.



Lysithea: If Claude somehow survived, I imagine he's terribly wounded. All three forces have suffered heavy losses. We're incredibly lucky to have not been involved. This is a perfect and unique opportunity to go on the offense. Now is the time to prove ourselves, Professor.



Marianne: I never used to care whether I lived or died... But when I think of all those who died at Gronder, I realize how precious life truly is. I'm ashamed of how arrogant I was to think that death could mean so little...



Hilda: I like this idea of yours--dressing as Imperial soldiers so they'll let us in. But don't you wish there was one more twist in the plan? Come on, Professor, think! How could we add another wrinkle, hm?
Byleth: We can dress you as the emperor. 
Hilda: Dress me as Edelgard?! But we look nothing alike!
Byleth: We could dress Seteth as a woman.
Hilda: Seteth, dressed as a woman? I don't understand what the point of that would be.
Hilda: On second thought, let's just stick to the plan as originally conceived. That seems safer.



Leonie: Under your leadership, we can win any battle, no matter the odds. That's what everyone's saying anyway. Hope you can keep up with our expectations, Professor.



Seteth: The battle at Gronder Field certainly took an unexpected turn, did it not? Let us press on, so as not to waste the opportunity. Fort Merceus is a keep that was constructed to defend the Imperial Capital, Enbarr. We cannot enter the capital without first capturing that fort. But once we have it, the city should be almost entirely at our mercy. I will make the necessary preparations. Be ready.



Flayn: Standing face to face with those whom I went to school with. On the field of battle... How inhuman war is--how horrifying. My heart feels shattered. It is my hope that this war marks the end of such foolish behavior.



Hanneman: Fort Merceus is the Empire's single most fortified military installation. Utterly impregnable, they say. I wonder, do you happen to know the nickname given to Fort Merceus?
Byleth: The Silver Maiden.
Hanneman: No, I'm afraid that name refers to the Fortress City of Arianrhod.
Byleth: FÃ³dlan's Locket.
Hanneman: That one is a fortress that stands at FÃ³dlan's Throat.
Byleth: The Stubborn Old General. 
Hanneman: Indeed! A very good answer, but of course you'd know that.
Hanneman: Seems FÃ³dlans give everyone and everything a nickname. Why, you were called the Ashen Demon! Myself, I have been called the Father of Crestology, which is a nickname as well as a title, I suppose...



Manuela: Each step closer to Enbarr, I'm reminded of another part of my past. Riches and poverty, glory and failure, that city has it all. And if I'm honest...sometimes I miss it. That's how the past works though, isn't it? It's always a different story than what you really lived.



Alois: You're quite a tactician! Disguising ourselves as enemy soldiers to sneak in, undetected. A stroke of brilliance. In a frontal attack, our losses would be tremendous. With this strategy, we can really snatch victory from the jaws of...deceit!
Byleth: That's a good point.
Alois: Yes... With you leading our fighters, I've no doubt the Empire will suffer an embarrassing deceit. Get it? Deceit? Again?
Byleth: That's a bad pun. 
Alois: Ah, rats! You've seen through my cunning punning!



Catherine: I hardly recognize everyone... Their faces have changed so much. More experience in the eyes, and more pain. I'm glad that they're stronger, but I hate to think they've all become hardened killers. Look after them, OK? Try to keep 'em on the straight-and-narrow.



Shamir: Did you give the ridiculous order to prepare Imperial armor for every one of our troops? I've reached out through all my channels, but there are limits to these things. I'll have to recruit an entire town's worth of people if I ever plan on making enough.



Cyril: Guess what I noticed. I can see further than most other people can see. But I can't figure the point of seeing further than an arrow can fly, since I can't shoot what I see.
Byleth: You could detect enemy movements in advance.
Cyril: I suppose I could see a whole horde of enemies coming and run away. That's kinda useful at least.
Byleth: You could find our targets quicker than anyone. 
Cyril: Yeah, I suppose it could be real useful for finding Lady Rhea too.




Anna: A Class reunion on the battlefield? That's...bleak. That must've been so hard on everyone. You gotta keep looking after them all. I mean, they still look to you for guidance, you know?



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Is it true that we'll be assaulting Fort Merceus next? That doesn't sound like the brightest idea... I've heard that it's built to withstand an attack from even the largest of armies! Not to tell you how to do your job, but don't do it! I'm not ready to say my final good-byes to everyone...

@Intro 
Seteth: We are just about to pass through Gronder Field. We should be in view of Fort Merceus soon. It looks like the battle made quite an impact... The Imperial Army has lost some of its luster. We should soon be able to invade the fort without too much trouble.
Byleth: Because of the Alliance and Kingdom's sacrifices...
Seteth: Yes, we must win for them as well.
Byleth: We cannot let this opportunity pass us by.
Seteth: Yes, after a few short months, they will already be back on their feet. We cannot waste this opportunity.
Ferdinand: Professor, the soldiers have finished changing into their disguises. We are ready to masquerade as Imperial troops and infiltrate the fort.
Byleth: Disguises?
Byleth: Infiltrate the fort?
Seteth: I believe this was your idea, was it not? It is impossible to take Fort Merceus with a frontal assault. We must take it from within. We will infiltrate the fort as Imperial troops and kill the enemy general. All preparations are complete.
Caspar: According to the scout reports, my father and the others are not inside the fort. It seems they were moved to the front lines of the Kingdom's western region.
Church Soldier: The Death Knight became the general of this fort after the battle at Gronder Field.
Bernadetta: What?! The Death Knight?! I think I'll be taking a break now... You guys go on ahead.
Petra: Bernadetta, you cannot be hiding on a field. The enemy will be seeing you.
Bernadetta: No place to hide?! I guess... I have no choice but to fight!
Seteth: The Death Knight... I hear that he is counted among the greatest heroes of the Empire at the moment. We never determined whether or not he was truly Jeritza. So in capturing Merceus, we have encountered another obstacle.
Byleth: We've beaten him before. 
Seteth: I suppose you have a point. If we challenge him again with conviction, we are sure to attain victory.
Byleth: Let's be careful.
Seteth: Yes, now more than ever.
Linhardt: The Impenetrable Fortress City of Arianrhod goes by the name Silver Maiden. Yet she pales in comparison to Fort Merceus--the Stubborn Old General. Those who approach are driven back, but once we make our way in, it's all ours.
Dorothea: That fort has been brought to life on stage for countless operas...
Seteth: Let us commence. We must puncture a hole in the Empire's defenses!


Death Knight: That man/woman approaches... Will death's scythe claim you... Or will I fall to that sword of yours...

@Opening 
At Gronder Field, the armies of the Kingdom, Alliance, and Empire collide. The three forces engage in a fierce battle, each suffering significant losses before deciding to withdraw. Seeing an opportunity, the resistance army quickly plots an invasion of Imperial territory. In order to gain a foothold in the Empire, they will attempt to capture Fort Merceus.

Fort Merceus, said to be impregnable, lies between you and Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Seizing the sturdy fortress will require a carefully devised strategy.

@Battle
Imperial Soldier: Report! A group posing as Imperial soldiers has infiltrated! They seem to be affiliated with the church!
Death Knight: Close the gates. Leave no survivors.

Death Knight: The time is ripe.
Seteth: Do not let him get away! Circle around and cut off his retreat!

Death Knight: The time of ruin draws near... But their slaughter must wait until next we meet...
Seteth: He's fled, has he? Let us deal with the remaining foes and then make haste in our pursuit!

@Boss 
%Mercedes,Death Knight
Death Knight: You. Leave.
Mercedes: No! I won't! I... I refuse to run from you anymore!

%Flayn,Death Knight
Flayn: So it's you, Death Knight! Remember me?!
Death Knight: You again. Here to lose more blood?
Flayn: Never! You will not lay a hand on me ever again

%Seteth,Death Knight
Seteth: You will not escape, Death Knight. Today you will be unmasked!
Death Knight: My true identity has no value.
Seteth: I will be the judge of that, once I've seen your face.

Death Knight: If you desire to slay me, follow. The appointed hour is at hand...

@Cutscene 
Death Knight: It is coming... Leave now or all of you will die.

Alliance Soldier in Imperial gear: Run! We have to evacuate immediately!

Alliance Infantry Soldier: What just happened here?
Alliance Armoured Soldier: The fort, it's... It's just... gone.

@End 
Seteth: Whatever could that have been... It was almost reminiscent of that terror of legend...
Byleth: What legend?
Seteth: We haven't the time for stories...
Byleth: We need to get out of here.
Seteth: Agreed. We must retreat for now.
Seteth: All we can do is retreat to the Great Bridge of Myrddin and assess our situation.


Manuela: Well now, that marching was nearly as trying as the battle itself.
Hanneman: We wasted a few days, but now that we're this far back, we should be safe... Or so I believe.
Catherine: I still can't believe it. The fort was destroyed, just like that...
Shamir: The Death Knight knew about the attack. Was it the Empire's doing?
Cyril: Guess that means they'd rather destroy the fort than lose it.
Alois: Whatever the case, we need to get our bearings and decide what we're going to do next.
Seteth: We all have many questions, but for now, we must focus on our next move.
Byleth: Let's give up.
Seteth: What?! How could... Ah. Yes, I see.
Byleth: Let's attack the Imperial capital.
Seteth: I wish for that as well, but we are sure to fall if we charge in without a plan. Hmm... But by the look on your face, I have the feeling you are working out a plan even now.
Byleth: Let's return to the monastery.
Seteth: What?! If we return to the monastery, then our situation is sure to... Ah. Yes, I see...
Byleth: Now you've got it.
Byleth: Whatever do you mean?
Seteth: No need to hide your intentions from me.
Seteth: So, we make it appear as though we have ceased our invasion by returning to Garreg Mach. Then we divide up our soldiers and infiltrate nearby areas of the capital right under the Empire's nose. Finally, we gather all of the soldiers somewhere we can get to swiftly from Garreg Mach and proceed to invade Enbarr. Is that what you are thinking?
Caspar: Are you serious? You know there's no guarantee that we won't be spotted by the enemy, right?
Ferdinand: If we fail to intervene, we will be isolated inside the Empire and be...utterly obliterated.
Petra: I will be embracing the nearness of death if I am needing to. With each other!
Bernadetta: That sounds dangerous...really, incredibly dangerous!
Seteth: Make no mistake...if we fail in this plan, there will be no coming back from it. Are you sure about this, Professor?
Byleth: It's our only hope.
Seteth: I see. If you are resolved, then I will follow suit. We may be weaker and the terrain may be against us, but all we can do is use our resources the best we can. That, and pray for the blessings of the goddess.
/***EOF***/
@Opening
Having parted ways with Edelgard, former students of the Black Eagle House now work alongside the Knights of Seiros at Garreg Mach. They begin to create a resistance army strong enough to take on her Imperial forces.

@Dialogue 
Alois: Ah, thank the goddess... I couldn't bear the thought of letting Jeralt down by not finding you.
Shamir: Guess you lucked out.
Catherine: We've been looking everywhere for you! But...I see Lady Rhea isn't with you. Damn.
Cyril: Everyone was real worried about you, Professor.
Hanneman: Seteth has told us everything. From here on out, you will have our aid.
Seteth: I am so grateful that everyone is safe. I am sorry things are moving so rapidly, but there is something we must discuss. Come with me.



Seteth: The time has come to make our true stand against the Empire.
Byleth: Let's win, no matter what.
Byleth: Let's all work together. 
Byleth: I don't feel confident, but we'll do our best.
Seteth: Our base will be Garreg Mach Monastery. The interior is in less than pristine condition, but we should be able to utilize it much the same as we had before.
Catherine: Surely those Imperial jerks have this place staked out, right? It's a highly strategic location.
Seteth: It may be an area of importance, but it is far removed from the front lines. Considering the burden of transport, it is possible they are not paying too much attention to it.
Shamir: Nothing escapes the emperor. There must be at least a spy or two.
Flayn: Professor, what do you think?
Byleth: I have no objections.
Flayn: I see! Then it must be the right idea!
Byleth: I'm worried about supplies.
Seteth: Your concern is valid. However...
Seteth: The town and surrounding hamlets are still present, and though far from abundant, the church still has funds at its disposal.
Flayn: That's true... Professor, I think we can leave expanding our army to my brother. He was always good at negotiating, and I believe he is best suited to the task.
Ferdinand: In that case, I have a request. Please allow my soldiers to join your ranks as well. House Aegir already tried taking on the emperor. As a result, our territory was stolen from us. As a consequence, I do not have many soldiers left to speak of. But those I have are yours to command.
Dorothea: I feel like I should tell you that I've been protecting some kids who lost their parents in the war. They're in the town right now, but maybe we can move them to the monastery? I'm sure they'd be happy to chip in however they can.
Seteth: Hm... Yes, I understand. I will make the necessary arrangements.
Linhardt: I nabbed some valuables from my house. Father is with the emperor now, so... It's not much, but it's yours.
Bernadetta: I don't have a thing to contribute. In fact, I'm still in my same old clothes!
Caspar: I've been wandering on my own for five years. I won't go back to that house or my father, that's for sure!
Seteth: I understand. Leave it to me. No labor is too great if it means saving FÃ³dlan...

@Conversation 
Ferdinand: I have lost my dominion. My nobility may seem like nothing more that a title. But I will never lose my noble heart. I will stop Edelgard, even if it costs me my life. I have turned my blade against her now. I cannot go back on that decision. Professor... Do you think I chose the wrong path?
Byleth: Not at all.
Ferdinand: You are right...
Byleth: We'll find out soon enough. 
Ferdinand: You are right...



Linhardt: The promise was made five years ago, but I must say I'm rather impressed by how many of us managed to make it. Personally, I only showed up because I hoped to see you again, Professor. I've been with my family in the Empire until recently. I admit to feeling a little guilty betraying Her Majesty...but only a little. Now that we're all together again, I suppose the fighting will begin soon.



Caspar: Hey, Professor! You won't believe what happened! I figured I couldn't go back to the Empire after Garreg Mach fell, so I started drifting across the Kingdom and the Alliance. Then I just happened to run into our old class, so we came back to the monastery together!

Bernadetta: Ah, at last, I return to my domain! My lonely paradise! My realm of exquisite solitude! Huh? Professor? Is that, um. Is that you? You, um. You didn't hear that just now, did you?
Byleth: Sorry.
Bernadetta: Oh! Forget you heard anything!
Byleth: Hear what? 
Bernadetta: Right. You didn't? Well, um. Good.



Dorothea: Laaa-la-laaa-la-laaa... Professor! Oh my! It's so good to see you. These days, so many old friends seem to be disappearing. But you... You're here! It's incredible to see you again after five years! I have a feeling your name will go down in history.



Petra: Edelgard is controlling the Empire. She is putting the pressure on the Kingdom and Alliance. Empire and religion are at open war. It will be...difficult for us at first. But corrupt nobles are many. That means that common people will rebel and be joining our side. With you, Professor, the battle tides will...ah, will turn. I have certainty.



Felix: A country with no king has no future. That's why I made my way here. Professor, don't let me down.
Byleth: Country with no king?
Felix: Hmph. You'll understand soon enough.
Byleth: Let's forge ahead. 
Felix: Yes, let's. Find me a worthy opponent to battle, and I'll be content.




Sylvain: I left home without telling my father. Did you know that? I can just imagine my father's face contorted in anger and the delightful words he must have used to describe me. Kind of a scary image, actually. But regardless, I've put my faith in you, Professor. And I'm hoping I haven't made a big mistake.



Sylvain: Hey, Professor. It's been a while. It's really good to see you again. Gorgeous as ever, might I add. An awful lot has happened in these past five years. There were so many times I wished you were around. I'm glad you're back. Your skills are worth more than a whole army.



Mercedes: You're here, Professor, along with everyone from our old class. It's like we've gone back in time! When I think that I'll be around you again, all of my sorrows just drift away.
Byleth: Frankly, I don't feel too happy.
Mercedes: Hmm, I understand. Especially with Lady Rhea missing... It sounds like the Kingdom and Alliance have been in a sorry state too. But we can't let that get us down!
Byleth: Let's do our best together.
Mercedes: Hmm, yes. I'll at least try not to hold anyone back.
Mercedes: Let's work together for the common good, like we did five years ago!



Annette: Members of the knights tell me that Father left their ranks five years ago. They say he announced he was returning to the Kingdom, but nobody's heard from him since. I haven't received word that he went back home to Mother... Where could he be... Where are you, Father...



Ingrid: Professor, I have a proposal. Why not go beyond the Knights of Seiros--instead, uniting with allies from all across FÃ³dlan to fight for our cause? Looking back, it would have been best to ally with the Kingdom and join forces against the Empire. But now the Kingdom is not exactly... Well...



Raphael: Fighting alongside you and everyone else is a dream come true, Professor! And don't worry about my little sis. Right now she's back home helping out with the family business. I kinda figured I was gonna be stuck going back and taking over for her. But thanks to you guys, I get to work on my dream of becoming a proper knight!



Ignatz: It's been fixed up quite a bit, but its battle scars aren't so easily erased... To think that a glorious cathedral, with a thousand year history...would end up like this. I'll rebuild this place someday. This cathedral is the symbol of FÃ³dlan. Maybe I should paint a picture of the beautiful cathedral of old, while I still remember what it looked like...



Lysithea: I've grown weary and impatient--these past five years, my hands have been bound. But now, I can finally take action with a clear goal. I'm grateful to you and to everyone.
Byleth: I didn't do anything. 
Lysithea: Nonsense. Your presence steeled everyone's resolve.
Byleth: And that goal is?
Lysithea: Down with the Empire! Surely peace will soon follow if the Empire is overthrown. Then my parents can finally find peace themselves.



Marianne: Even with the church in shambles, we can still pray. The goddess will surely hear our prayers, but still... I hope the church can return to its former beauty someday.



Hilda: Hey, Professor? I know that we didn't plan to stop at the monastery, but I'm glad we did. I'm happy to be here with everyone again.
Byleth: You're happy at a time like this?
Hilda: What good does grimness do us? Let's try to enjoy our time together while we still can.
Byleth: I'm happy too. 
Hilda: Right? It's as though we went back in time five years. I feel like my old self again.



Leonie: It's not just for my village that I'm fighting alongside you here, you know. It's also that Captain Jeralt asked me, his first and greatest apprentice, to look out for you. Of course, it wouldn't be enough just to keep you alive. It's my duty to make sure you win too. So, do your best, Professor. And count on me to watch your back.



Seteth: With the return of its knights, Garreg Mach is finally coming back to life. The Church of Seiros will follow you from now on, but please do not abandon the search for Lady Rhea.
Byleth: We'll do whatever it takes to find her. 
Seteth: Thank you. I know the battles ahead will be dire, but we will support you with all our strength.
Byleth: We don't know what the future will bring.
Seteth: Wherever she is, Rhea is doubtlessly waiting for you. Please do not let her down.



Flayn: Professor, I am so glad you are unharmed! No matter the path you walk, I will be with you every step of the way. Anything you ask of me, I shall see it through. You saved my life, and I am in your debt.



Hanneman: Thankfully, it appears the records and equipment I need for my research have not been damaged. I am most curious though. You say you were asleep for five whole years? Incredible. Perhaps this is another effect of your Crest. I do look forward to investigating you in greater detail.
Byleth: We can talk about that. 
Hanneman: Wonderful news! I am most excited to begin. We must find the time, of course.
Byleth: Uh, maybe later...
Hanneman: I'll have to be content with observing you wherever you go, then. I cannot waste any opportunity!



Manuela: My, Professor. You haven't changed a bit! At your age, I'd expect your while demeanor to have changed greatly over five years... Though, I suppose I haven't changed either right? Thank you for noticing, by the way. Ah, just the two of us, forever young. Oh, let me have my fun.



Alois: I'd given up on ever seeing you again. Where have you been hiding? Anyway, now that we're reunited in the land of the living, I must fulfill my promise!
Byleth: What promise?
Alois: The promise I made to the captain, to keep you safe! I can't believe you've forgotten. How cold...
Byleth: Right, the promise. 
Alois: That's right! I promised the captain I'd protect you in his stead, and now I'll make good on my word!



Catherine: In Lady Rhea's absence, I will follow you. That's what she would want me to do. Know that wherever you might lead us, I'll continue searching for Lady Rhea.
Byleth: That's fine. 
Catherine: Good, because I will not budge on that point. Welcome back, Professor.
Byleth: Sounds like a lot of trouble.
Catherine: I don't care how much trouble it is! I will rescue Lady Rhea, at all costs.



Shamir: I'm more of a mercenary than a knight these days. I work to get paid. I never was too attached to FÃ³dlan. I was considering leaving soon... But I might change my mind if you're around.



Cyril: I don't know anything about rebuilding, but I can sure do my best to clean up the mess. I'm gonna keep Lady Rhea's room spotless, so she can use it right away whenever she gets back. You gotta find her, Professor. You just gotta.



Anna: There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals.

Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! You know, it's such a thrill to be able to greet you like this again! I almost died in the battle five years ago, but I won't allow any enemies to get into this place again. I promise you that! even if the Death Knight shows up, I'll be sure to... Well, for now I'll keep training so I can eventually feel confident that I can stop him!

@Intro 
Seteth: Your attention, everyone. The Knights of Seiros and our most trusted allies have gathered. We have rallied our troops for the purpose of stopping the Adrestian Empire's efforts to rule all. We have prepared a new flag to fight under...
Seteth: Much like the professor, it bears the Crest of Flames. I hope everyone finds this suitable. Beneath this flag, we will bring back peace to the great land of FÃ³dlan!


Flayn: Professor, I'm not sure I understand... Why is the Empire intent on making an enemy of the church?
Byleth: I don't understand either.
Flayn: Quite perplexing... If the church disappears from FÃ³dlan, I wonder if the Empire thinks it will benefit them in some way? I feel, I feel that it will only confuse the people.
Byleth: They must oppose the way of the church.
Flayn: What is meant by the way of the church? What do they dislike about it?
Seteth: I have no idea what Edelgard was thinking or how she arrived at the decision to raise an army. However, I do have some small insight as to what she is after. She is attempting to destroy the existing social order. That is why the Church of Seiros is first on the list of institutions that must be destroyed. It may very well be her goal to rebuild FÃ³dlan from the ground up...
Flayn: I see... But that is only Edelgard's desire, is it not? I cannot imagine that the people of FÃ³dlan would want that for themselves. She may have high ideals, but she certainly lacks any compunction about throwing the world, and its people, into an awful war... It just seems so illogical!
Seteth: You have a point, Flayn. I do not believe the people will ever understand her aim. So long as she makes the people suffer, our Knights of Seiros will fight on and strive to protect them. If we do not defeat Edelgard and retake control of this world, FÃ³dlan's future shall be as dark as night.
Flayn: Thank you, dear Brother. I finally feel I understand what is going on.
Seteth: I am always happy to answer your questions, Flayn. Is there anything else you wish to ask?
Flayn: Well, um... Actually, I have a question for the professor. My brother mentioned that...you slumbered for five years. Where was it that you slept?
Byleth: At the bottom of a valley.
Flayn: The bottom of a valley? In the water? That certainly sounds frigid! I would never choose such a place myself. I am surprised you did not fall ill.
Byleth: Under a rock.
Flayn: Under a rock... How similar we are! As it were, I took my rest in a casket made of stone.

Flayn: Oh. Well, I suppose one's first long slumber is difficult to recall...
Byleth: ...
Knight of Seiros: Pardon the intrusion, but we must prepare a counterattack! Now! It seems the Imperial Army found out about us entering the monastery!
Seteth: Hm. That is sooner than expected. They must have been spying on us...
Flayn: I wonder if we can win on our own...
Knight of Seiros: There aren't many of them... It looks like we'll just be facing the ones who were stationed nearby.
Seteth: Did they move on us too soon? Perhaps if we fight by using the land to our advantage...
Byleth: Let's proceed carefully.
Seteth: Of course. If we are careful, we will not lose.
Byleth: Let's destroy them.
Flayn: Yes, I agree. Let us take them out in one fell swoop!
Seteth: Never again will those Imperial scoundrels disgrace Garreg Mach with their presence! Onward, Professor!

@Opening 
Though preparations are still being made to raise troops for the resistance army at Garreg Mach, the Imperial army is already one step ahead. Anticipating the resistance army's actions, General Randolph and the Imperial vanguard under his command begin their advance towards Garreg Mach to reclaim the monastery.

Fulfilling a promise made five years ago, your former students gather once more at the monastery, as do the knights. However, your joyful reunion is cut short...

@Battle 
Randolph: The Knights of Seiros are a powerful enemy, but we have more soldiers. We'll take them down all at once!
Seteth: Clever tactics are our only hope here. We will use fire to deal with the main enemy force.

Knight of Seiros: Report! The enemy has entered the periphery of Garreg Mach!
Seteth: If we allow them to take the interior, the monastery will be lost. We must drive them back!

Imperial Soldier: What? That strange battle flag is... But isn't our enemy the Church of Seiros?
Randolph: They didn't have enough soldiers with just the church, so they upped their numbers by joining with those filthy rogues. It doesn't matter what flag they fly. They're nothing more than a mob. We'll destroy them all!

Seteth: Our troops are preparing the attack. Protect them until they reach their destination!

Seteth: Ugh... To think we'd let Garreg Mach fall twice to these rebels...

Randolph: A total loss... But we can't just return home like this...
Seteth: Watch out, Professor! They're coming for you!


Seteth: Our fire unit was destroyed. The plan has failed...
Randolph: It looks like they were planning something, but it failed!

Seteth: All is prepared. Now we just need to draw the enemy's attention. Traitors! Repent of your sins and the goddess may yet show you mercy!
Randolph: Quiet! Don't think you'll get away with mocking me! Attack! Make sure they never speak again!
Seteth: Now! Begin!

Imperial Soldier 1: Fire! Gyaaaaaah!
Imperial Soldier 2: It burns! Save me!
Randolph: Argh, a fire attack... The damage is too great. We can't fight anymore! All units, retreat! I'll take on our pursuers! Carry away the injured soldiers!


Seteth: Press the attack! Give them no quarter!

@End 
Seteth: We drove back the Imperial army. The real fight has only just begun...
Caspar: I never thought I'd be fighting Randolph... I guess it can't be helped, seeing as how I've left my own territory and all. But...what will I do if my father or brother get involved. I really don't want to face them...
Byleth: We must stay strong.
Ferdinand: Too true, Professor. So long as the Empire is our enemy, we cannot avoid fighting those we are acquainted with. Though I suppose I have it easier since my house is no longer on the Empire's side.
Dorothea: My friends from the opera said they would leave the capital and go west... So, at least I won't be seeing them in battle.
Linhardt: Hmm, I don't think I care if my own house falls. Let's make it a grand fight...after a grand nap of course...
Petra: It does not give me happiness to have the people of Brigid involved...but it is not the time to be thinking of that. If it is a possibility, I will be having their strength.
Bernadetta: I don't mind at all. Really! I have no friends anyway, and my father hasn't done much to make me care for him. Not that he'd ever step on a battlefield anyway! Oh, but I do wonder how Mother is doing...
Seteth: Each of our situations is unique. What we share is companionship and the will to fight as one. Professor, you are the heart of our efforts. We will support you as best we can.

Seteth: I have a proposal. It would be most difficult to fight the Imperial army with the forces we have now. As such, I believe we should send messengers to whatever lords we can trust in the Kingdom and the Alliance so that we may gain their support. Do you agree?
Byleth: I agree. 
Seteth: It is heartening to hear you say that.
Byleth: It concerns me.
Seteth: It is difficult to know who we can trust, of course. But we cannot just stand idle either.
Seteth: If all we do is bide our time, out enemy's main army will come down upon us like a hammer from above.
Shamir: Who are you planning to ask?
Catherine: Sadly, House Charon is out. We can trust them, but they have no help to offer.
Alois: Hm, how about House Daphnel of the Alliance? Their leader is sure to at least respond.
Flayn: Oh, how about House Daphnel of the Alliance? I recall that their leader was quite exceptional.
Seteth: Judith, the Hero of Daphnel... Yes, that is a fine suggestion. That territory is on the border of the Kingdom and the Alliance. It has not yet been claimed by the fires of war. If they agree to lend us their troops, out forces will be greatly strengthened. We shall send along a secret messenger at once.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
After storming the streets of Enbarr and bringing imperial forces to their knees, the resistance army surrounds the Imperial palace. To topple the Empire and save Rhea from its clutches, the resistance army steels itself for battle against Emperor Edelgard.

@Intro 
Seteth: Everyone. It is probable that Rhea is within the castle walls. We must defeat Edelgard and rescue Rhea in one fell swoop, no matter what stands in our way.
Byleth: I don't want to kill Edelgard.
Byleth: Perhaps we can walk the same path as Edelgard...
Seteth: She is one of your students. I understand your desire for a path to peace. But she will never bend to our will. You do understand that, do you not? We have no choice but to kill her.
Ferdinand: We have already killed Hubert. Now is no time to hesitate.
Caspar: She has it coming! After all, she started this war!
Bernadetta: Someone has to stop her, and that someone is us!
Linhardt: As her former classmates, I feel we owe it to her to try talking it out.
Petra: This battle will be a deciding one. I am believing that it is her wish to be facing us.
Dorothea: Poor Edie... Professor, wherever you lead, I'll follow.
Cyril: I... I'll fight with all I got to save Lady Rhea!
Alois: In the name of the Knights of Seiros, we'll bring the hammer down on the Imperial army!
Flayn: The lives of Lady Rhea and everyone here are more important than all else. I shall be prepared.
Seteth: I leave this mission in your hands. Say the word, and we shall begin!

@Battle 
Edelgard: They've made it into the palace, but it's actually the perfect chance to turn the tables on them. Defeating them all will turn the tide of the war instantly. Taking a risk on dragging us back from the brink is the only option. Everyone! Prepare for a bitter struggle! Victory to the Adrestian Empire!

Seteth: The throne room is tightly locked. But wherever there are locks, there are also keys.


Dedue: So close... Must press on...


Imperial Soldier: Infiltrators! Kill them!

Edelgard: I must confess I never imagined that you would be able to pursue me this far. I don't mean to belittle your skills, Professor, but you've far surpassed my expectations.

Seteth: Block off the stairwells! Stop their reinforcements from getting through!

Seteth: Well done! Their reinforcements are cut off.
Edelgard: Clever tactic. It's going to be difficult to turn the tables now.

@End 
Seteth: At last, it is over... Now we must find Rhea.
Flayn: Professor! Brother! I have a letter. The Imperial general asked me to deliver this to my instructor.
Seteth: Who is it from? Hurry up, Professor. Read it at once.
Ferdinand: It is from...Hubert? Though he has left this world, he is reaching out through this letter...
Hubert: If you are reading this letter, that means I have perished. As Her Majesty would never surrender to another, I can only assume she has fallen as well. It greatly pains me to think of this coming to pass... That said, as the survivors, I must ask you to settle certain affairs in our stead. You must destroy the threat that slithers in the dark. I am sure you must recall Monica and Tomas.
Seteth: What Hubert has written here... I cannot... No, I know it must be true. And if that is the case, then all else makes sense now. I must speak with Rhea. It seems our battle is not over just yet. Those who slither in the dark... We must kill every last one of them, or FÃ³dlan will never again know peace.
Flayn: They are allies of Monica and Tomas... Correct? The ones who were after my blood. And also the ones who destroyed Fort Merceus with that mysterious light...
Seteth: We shall discuss this more after we have rescued Rhea.

Rhea: You... You have come to save me... Is this... Is this a dream? I have longed to see you again... all this time... Is it truly you?

Rhea: Seteth, Flayn... You are here as well... Thank you for supporting the professor, and for rescuing me.
Seteth: Rhea... I am overjoyed that you are unharmed. I could not stand losing another of our kind.
Rhea: Yes... I am reminded of the past... of reuniting in Enbarr...
Seteth: It is truly nostalgic. I would love nothing more than to lose ourselves in memories of the old days, but... I must tell you something, Rhea. We have received incredible news, albeit from the Empire. They have told us the identity of our enemy. Those who slither in the dark... It is time for us to stop hiding the truth about the goddessâthe progenitor god. The truth about us. It is time for us to tell the people everything.
Rhea: Those who slither in the dark...
Flayn: We are told they despise the children of the goddess, as well as those who live above ground. They are planning something horrible.
Rhea: ...
Seteth: Please, tell the professor everything about these vile people. There must be things that only you know.
Rhea: I understand. Dear child... I will now tell you all that I know. It is true that there is a group of people who have slithered in the darkness and threatened the peace of FÃ³dlan since ancient times. I am sure you have heard the stories of a man named Nemesis...
Byleth: The King of Liberation...
Byleth: The wielder of the Sword of the Creator...
Seteth: Nemesis, the King of Liberation... The man who received the Sword of the Creator from the goddess and became a hero. However...
Rhea: Nemesis was originally the leader of a group of bandits. He plundered the Holy Tomb and stole the remains of the progenitor god. When Nemesis appeared in Zanado some time later, he already wielded the Sword of the Creator.
Byleth: In Zanado?
Seteth: The Red Canyon. We journeyed there five years ago. Do you recall?
Byleth: How did he get the Sword of the Creator?
Rhea: The legend that the goddess gifted him the sword so that he could fight the wicked gods...is false. That story was created after the fact.
Rhea: I do not know how Nemesis obtained the sword, or why he appeared in Zanado. But he used that sword to massacre the people there. The children of the progenitor god. From their corpses he gained even more power, and brought war to FÃ³dlan... A mere bandit like Nemesis would not have been capable of anything so monstrous on his own...
Seteth: It was surmised that someone was collaborating with Nemesis, and there was a massive investigation to uncover who it was. But the truth was never discovered. I am now certain that his accomplices were Those who slither in the dark. And this time, they have utilized the imperial army to send FÃ³dlan back into the flames of war...
Flayn: So, Edelgard has made a temporary alliance with them in order to achieve her own aims... Professor, we must journey to Shambhala and stop them!

Rhea: You must not allow FÃ³dlan's bloody history... the Red Canyon Tragedy... to repeat itself...
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Having repelled the Imperial vanguard, the resistance army, in desperate need of troops, seeks help from Judith, head of House Daphnel - the governing body in the northwestern regions of Alliance territory.

@Dialogue 
Seteth: Ah, it's you.
Flayn: We were just talking about Rhea...
Seteth: We have searched for five long years but have not found a trace of her. It is possible that she is sleeping somewhere... Just as you were sleeping all those years.
Byleth: Is that what you think?
Seteth: That is my current theory, yes.
Byleth: Perhaps. 
Flayn: Do you think so? I truly hope that is the case.
Seteth: We have moved against the Empire with the intent of defeating them, but have not given up hope of recovering Rhea. If she is alive, we will find her. Rhea is like family to us...and to you, as well. Please, lend me your strength...

Seteth: The messenger we sent to Daphnel returned with a reply. Please, read it at once.

Judith: I understand your situation. I will help you with whatever strength I have to spare. But there is a problem. Openly marshaling soldiers within my territory could provoke other members of the Alliance. Therefore, I will secretly gather troops in Ailell, the Valley of Torment. Will your group be able to receive the soldiers in this location? From there, it should be safe to return to the monastery by following the border between the Alliance and the Kingdom.
Byleth: Ailell, the Valley of Torment...
Seteth: Ailell is a deep valley located on the border of the Kingdom and the Alliance. People stay far away. There, we can meet without anyone finding out. It is decided. Make plans to meet up with our reinforcements at once.

Church Soldier: Ailell, the Valley of Torrment...

@Conversation 
Ferdinand: Some day we will take the Imperial capital. It is odd to think that I will be invading the very city that I once called home. Ah, that is still a ways off. I will prepare for our journey to Ailell.



Linhardt: I never do get used to the sight of blood. It always makes me feel as if I might faint. I suppose I've told you that though, yes? I've no idea how you cope with it. I hope this war ends soon. I dislike being lightheaded because other people are bleeding everywhere. Though the thought of working hard for it does sound like quite a pain...



Caspar: I didn't think we'd end up fighting Randolph... He's my uncle. Well, not by blood, so... I guess I can handle it.
Byleth: I'm still worried about you.
Caspar: Don't worry about me. I'm ready for anything.
Byleth: You're very resolute. 
Caspar: Don't worry about me. I'm ready for anything.

Bernadetta: Ailell, the Valley of Torment? What kind of a name for a place is that? It sounds scary. Do I really have to go with you? Hey, um, here's an idea... Maybe let the recluse stay home and hold the fort!



Dorothea: Hey, Professor, thanks for your hard work again! Nothing to report today! Was I convincing? Was it like he was standing right in front of you? Some things are the same as they were five years ago, but I guess a lot more has changed...



Petra: Since the past, I have learned much of the language of FÃ³dlan. But speaking the FÃ³dlan language still gives me difficulty. I can understand, read, and write with nearly perfection now. But understanding and speaking are...fruits of a different color.
Byleth: That's part of your charm. 
Petra: I have gratitude for you, Professor. I hope that I will have fluency one day.
Byleth: Everyone has a weak spot.
Petra: Yes. I will keep practicing more.



Felix: Some in Faerghus believe Dimitri is still alive. My father is one such eccentric. Hmph, they can't accept reality. Dimitri is dead. He's not coming back.



Sylvain: Ailell, the Valley of Torment. Aw, man... I really do not want to go there.
Byleth: Pull yourself together.
Sylvain: Professor, have you ever been to Ailell? If you had, you'd know. That place is crazy hot! For guys like me who grew up somewhere cold? Man... It's gonna be rough. Though, I guess that climate will keep our enemies at bay.
Byleth: Why not? 
Sylvain: That place is crazy hot! For guys like me who grew up somewhere cold? Man... It's gonna be rough. Though, I guess that climate will keep our enemies at bay.



Mercedes: We may not be students anymore, but it's still important to read. We might even learn something that's useful for our next battle.
Byleth: Studying is important.
Mercedes: I couldn't agree more! I hope the Officers Academy reopens when the war is over.
Byleth: Training is important too.
Mercedes: I suppose that may be true. I always try my best at both.
Mercedes: It's a shame the monastery was ruined, but... At least the books are still intact!



Annette: Professor, is it really OK to rely on Judith? I hear there are still quarrels within the Alliance... This generous offer of soldiers and supplies seems a little too good to be true. I mean, it's also really impressive, but I'm just a little worried, I suppose...



Ingrid: My family, the Galateas, are an offshoot of the Daphnel family. The family split in half when two brothers quarreled over an inheritance. Despite blood relations, the families lived apart from one another, so the relationship has been distant and somewhat estranged. I'm not so much acquainted with Judith, the head of House Daphnel.



Raphael: Sharing her food with us for nothing in return? Judith really is a great person! She's more like a goddess than the goddess is!
Byleth: She is very much like a goddess. 
Raphael: I never met her, so I don't know for sure, but she must be beautiful and kind.
Byleth: I'm not sure about that.
Raphael: No? Well, she can be a demon for all I care, so long as she feeds me!



Ignatz: The Valley of Torment... I'd heard of it, but I never expected to go there. It's exciting! I wonder what the landscape is like.
Byleth: It sounds dangerous.
Ignatz: It probably is dangerous, but I still want to get there and see it as soon as I can.
Byleth: It sounds painful. 
Ignatz: Hmm, that is an interesting point... The name does seem to suggest that.



Lysithea: Ailell, the Valley of Torment, lies on the border of three noble territories. The Kingdom's Fraldarius and Galatea families, and the Alliance's Daphnel family. In the Fraldarius lands to the north, the former Kingdom army and new duke's army are fighting.



Marianne: Valley of Torment... Valley of Torment...
Byleth: Something wrong? 
Marianne: I once read a book full of legends surrounding Ailell, but I can't seem to remember...
Byleth: Are you chanting some sort of curse?
Marianne: N-no... I'm trying to remember the legends surrounding Ailell...



Hilda: My big brother told me stories of Judith's bravery. With just one look, she tamed a runaway horse that nobody else had been able to touch. When an Almyran general provoked her, she talked him into a tearful apology. She's spectacular. I wish she'd fight alongside us.



Leonie: You're not a teacher anymore, and we're not your students, but everyone still calls you Professor. Is there something you'd rather be called?
Byleth: Professor is fine.
Leonie: Guess that's what we're used to, huh? All right.
Byleth: Call me by my name. 
Leonie: Oh? All right, then. I'll call you--ugh. Nope! Sorry, can't do it. Too weird.



Seteth: Meeting reinforcements in the Valley of Torment seems like an astute decision to me. In that land of oppressive heat, it is unlikely that we will be disturbed. It also means we will contend with those harsh conditions ourselves, however. Best ensure we are well prepared.



Flayn: It has been only five years, yet so much has changed. Half of the Kingdom has fallen to the Empire, Skirmishes are rife throughout the Alliance. Despite such tumult, we look upon the same sky, unchanged by the storm happening beneath it.
Byleth: Do you wish you could return to those days?
Flayn: Yes, it would be nice, I suppose. Things were... simpler then. Or so they seemed to be, at the time.
Byleth: It's true--it's just like it was all those years ago. 
Flayn: Indeed. I gazed up at this same sky with Mother and Father. It does not feel so long ago at all. Wait, but how would you know, Professor?



Hanneman: The monastery repairs have made solid progress. Most excellent news. When we first returned here, I was unsure what we were going to do with the ruins of this place... But if we can get the cathedral rebuilt, we'll have it looking just like old times soon enough.



Manuela: Hearing that an old student has died cuts me right to the heart... As this war with the Empire continues, we'll see more of it, Professor. We have a duty to fight alongside our students. We taught them how to fight, after all. Now, let's help them win!



Alois: Even though we're getting reinforcements, we should still be prepared for the worst. Never shirk your training, no matter what. To practice, I'm going to chop something up with my sword. Unless you'd like to train together! Care to spar?



Catherine: I've heard people talk about the Hero of Daphnel. If the stories of her courage are true, no one will be able to stand against us. In different circumstances, I'd have wanted to try crossing swords with her. Right now, we have to focus on getting those reinforcements. Let's hope nothing goes wrong.



Shamir: There are enemy spies around. Remain vigilant. Capture anyone who seems suspicious.
Byleth: To kill them?
Shamir: What else would we do with them?
Byleth: All right, I will. 
Shamir: I'm glad you understand. I'm counting on you.



Cyril: Gotta clean out the storerooms, tend the flowers, do the washing, dust the library...
Byleth: That sounds like a lot of work.
Cyril: Well, it's my job, ya know? Gotta do your job.
Byleth: Do you need any help? 
Cyril: Nah, this is my job. Lady Rhea herself gave it to me. Even if Lady Rhea's not here right now, I still gotta do my duty.
Cyril: Like you. You gotta have other stuff you oughta be doing, yeah?



Anna: There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Is everyone setting out on a big campaign? Not exactly? Ah, so you're meeting up with the reinforcements. Well, you can leave guarding this place to me! I'll keep an eye out for anything suspicious!

@Opening 
In response to the resistance army's plea, Judith has agreed to provide soldiers. To meet up with the reinforcements, the resistance army sets out for Ailell, the Valley of Torment. Unbeknownst to them, something else awaits them there...

@Intro 
Linhardt: I'm overheated and have changed my mind. I'd like to return to my cozy bed now.
Bernadetta: Who knew somewhere so hot existed in FÃ³dlan. I wonder if it's OK to walk everywhere...
Ferdinand: Just use the superior emotional fortitude of nobility. And, well...be very careful.
Seteth: It is said that this land was born of the goddess's wrath. There was an immense battle here long ago. To end it, she set the entire valley aflame. Of course, there is no record of this. Some theorize this was done by another and then blamed on the goddess...
Petra: My head is being defeated by this heat. I think I am seeing visions... There, within the mountains... A shadow...
Caspar: That's just the-- Whoa. I see it too.
Seteth: It appears to be a military force...but in a different location than the one we agreed to.
Byleth: It's an enemy raid.
Seteth: They are dressed like Kingdom soldiers... They fooled us!
Byleth: They might be allies. 
Seteth: Hold a moment... They are dressed like Kingdom soldiers! Is this an ambush?
Shamir: Damn... I thought we had disposed of all the spies.
Catherine: They carry the flag of House Rowe... They've joined the Empire, then. To think they'd travel all this way.
Seteth: Are you ready to confront them, Professor?
Byleth: I'm worried about Judith.
Seteth: As am I. We have no reason to believe she was intercepted en route, but we must act quickly. Let us take them down and locate Judith's army!
Byleth: We must break through.
Seteth: Yes, we must defeat them quickly and locate Judith's army.
Seteth: They have chosen the Valley of Torment for this battle, and so we shall send them to the flames of eternity!

@Opening 
Your party travels to Ailell, the Valley of Torment, to meet up with allied troops and secure reinforcements. It should have been a safe march...

@Battle 
Gwendal: The Valley of Torment... Perhaps a good place to finish off my life as a knight. Only if that puny force of children is able to kill me, of course...
Seteth: That lion banner--it seems Gwendal is the one leading the troops of House Rowe. He is an experienced general, renowned throughout Faerghus. Let us hold nothing back.

Seteth: This is Ailell, the Valley of Torment. Expect this smoke and fire to assail us at every turn. Touching the flames of torment will get you worse than a scorching. Proceed carefully.

Gwendal: The Crest of Flames? Ha! Quite full of themselves, aren't they?
Ashe: Just as I thought--the professor's army. But it's too late to back out now. In Lonato's place, I have to do my duty.

Kingdom Soldier: Here we go! Attack them from both sides!

Judith: Oh, old Gwendal is here. And he doesn't look to be an ally...
Gwendal: Oh, the Hero of Daphnel is here! I'll expect more from her than the young ones...
Defeat Conditions: All of your units fall in battle, or Judith is defeated.

@Battle-Talk 
%Byleth,Judith
Judith: You... No, let's leave the pleasantries for later. First, I want you to take this. It's nothing important, but it may prove useful.

@Boss 
Ashe: Forgive me... But as Lonato's son, I have a duty!

%Byleth,Ashe
Ashe: I don't want to fight you, Professor... But this is how it has to be. There's no turning back.

@Boss
Ashe: I know this is it, but... I don't want to die...

Ashe: You want to spare me? Why? I'll... I'll do it. I'll join your side. Let me fight for you.

Gwendal: Does a whelp like you really expect to kill me? I am Gwendal, the Gray Lion, a knight by the hand of Count Rowe! Do your worst!

Gwendal: Ah, so I have found a place to die... Young ones... I thank you...
Seteth: That was quite a predicament. But now we can see to the objective we had in mind.

@End 
Judith: To think we'd get into a scrap here of all places. We're lucky we all made it out alive.
Byleth: I'm sorry for involving you in this.
Judith: Don't worry about it. In this day and age, it's a miracle I've been unscathed this long.
Byleth: I see why they call you a hero.
Judith: Well, that's ancient history.
Judith: So you're that professor everyone talks about. You're just as Claude described.
Byleth: Claude?
Judith: He asked me to help you because you seemed trustworthy.
Byleth: That professor everyone talks about?
Judith: You used to teach at the Officers Academy five years back, right? I guess you didn't teach Claude, though. He asked me to help you because you seemed trustworthy.
Seteth: Claude of the Alliance? How did he learn of our plans? We can't underestimate someone like him... There is a reason they call him the Master Tactician. But I suppose we are both fighting against the Empire now. The enemy of our enemy is our ally.
Judith: That's right. I have a letter from him as well.
Judith: It's up to you to decide how to use it.
Seteth: That is yours, Professor. Please tell me what it says when you see fit.
Judith: OK, let's wrap up this hand-off of soldiers. Not that I suspect you of anything, but... I must warn you that these are very important soldiers for my territory. Don't treat them like expendable equipment.
Judith: Oh. By the way, I have some important information. A witness saw Lady Rhea being dragged off by the Imperial Army after the battle five years ago.
Alois: Are you sure your source is reliable?
Judith: One of my own saw it happen. I'm certain.
Alois: It seems we chose wisely when decided to fight against the Empire.
Seteth: Thank you for the information. We will rescue her at all costs.

Seteth: Now that we have reinforcements, it is time to advance against the Empire. And yet, we do not have enough troops to face our enemy's main army head-on. We have no choice but to use our small numbers wisely by taking over key locations as we blaze our way to the Imperial capital.
Byleth: It's an easy win. 
Seteth: Do not indulge in being overly optimistic. It would be our ruin.
Byleth: It will be a fierce fight.
Seteth: Yes, it will. We must brace ourselves.
Seteth: As you know, the Oghma Mountains lie south of Garreg Mach, towards the Empire. In order to enter Empire territory, we must travel around those mountains. There are two possible routes--through the Kingdom to the west, and through the Alliance to the east.
Byleth: Let's go west.
Seteth: The western half of the Kingdom is under the Empire's control. It may be too dangerous to pass through there. I suggest we take the eastern route, for safety.
Byleth: Let's go east.
Seteth: Yes, that makes sense.
Seteth: There are lords in the Alliance who support the Empire, but they are, at least, not completely under their control. Furthermore, you hold a key to the Empire within your grasp.
Byleth: Claude's letter?
Seteth: Yes, precisely.
Byleth: The Sword of the Creator?
Byleth: My charm?
Seteth: This is no time for tomfoolery. I am referring to the letter from Claude.
Claude: Hey there, Teach. It's been a while, hasn't it? I never dared to imagine you might still be alive. Wonders never cease! I don't know exactly why, but I feel that I can trust you. So I'm going to do just that. To that end, I propose an exchange. You're intending to invade the Empire. That much is clear. And that means your only option is to pass through the east. You'll have to cross the Airmid River, which runs along the border between the Empire and the Alliance. That means you'll need to gain control of the Great Bridge of Myrddin, the one closest to Garreg Mach. It just so happens that my family, House Riegan, is in conflict with House Gloucester right now. It would be easy enough for us to eliminate them, but I would prefer that we settle things without it coming to that. Do you see where I'm going with this? We'll act as a distraction and draw House Gloucester away from there. That will allow you to cross through their territory and take the Great Bridge of Myrddin. After you take the bridge from the Imperial army, House Gloucester won't be able to receive their aid. You'll get to cross Myrddin without any trouble, and I'll be able to maintain stability in the Alliance. Not a bad deal, eh? I hope to hear from you soon. Be well, Teach.
Seteth: The Master Tactician, indeed. Somehow he is already aware of our plan. The conditions are not bad... All is he says it is. If we take the Great Bridge of Myrddin, and House Gloucester bows down to House Riegan... The route from the monastery to the Empire will be much safer for our forces.
Byleth: Let's do it.
Seteth: It seems you are decided. We will send our answer at once.
Byleth: I'm suspicious.
Seteth: I am afraid we have no choice, considering the circumstances...
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Claude's plan to call in Almyran forces succeeds, and the Alliance army captures Fort Merceus. Before they can celebrate their victory, javelins of light rain down from the sky and destroy the fort. Forced to temporary evacuate, the Alliance army regroups at Garreg Mach until it is ready to march on Enbarr, the Imperial Capital.

@Dialogue 
Claude: It's almost time to invade the Imperial capital. We still don't know where Rhea is, but if she's alive, she's likely in Enbarr. Hopefully we manage to find her without too much trouble.
Byleth: We need to save her quickly.
Claude: I know, but if we're not careful she'll just be whisked away again.
Byleth: I wonder if she's alive.
Claude: If the Empire has some reason to keep Rhea alive, then she's alive.
Claude: I'm sure you must be anxious to see her again.
Byleth: I need to see her again.
Claude: I understand. You need to see Rhea again so you can figure out who you really are.
Byleth: All I care about right now is saving her.
Claude: Well, if that's what you want, I'll do my best to make it happen.
Claude: But we're going up against Edelgard here... It won't be so simple.


Hilda: Our next stop is the Imperial capital. We've sure come a long way.
Raphael: What're you talking about? This is Garreg Mach! It's where we started.
Hilda: I didn't mean literally, Raphael. I was speaking symbolically!
Lorenz: My earnest desire to protect the Alliance has carried me this far. It will not fail me. I am sure the rest of you all have your own reasons to fight as well. Of course, I understand that the fight will not end until we defeat the Empire... And now the time has arrived at long last to march on the Imperial capital and defeat the emperor...
Hilda: It really gets you thinking, doesn't it? We all come from different places and have different goals and dreams. But thanks to those two, we were all able to come together and overcome all sorts of challenges.
Lysithea: You are referring to Claude and the professor, I assume. Even within our own odd group, those two are particularly unusual.
Hilda: Oh! So, you are aware that you're odd!
Lysithea: Well... That's... It was simply a figure of speech. I am speaking about Claude and the professor right now!
Marianne: They're like the wind and the trees...
Hilda: Huh? Claude and the professor are? What does that even mean, and who is which?
Marianne: Oh, um... I was just thinking that if we're the birds, then those two are like the trees and the wind. The professor is a great tree that kindly embraces us and watches over us as we perch on its branches... And Claude is like the wind, pushing us forward as we soar across the open sky...
Hilda: Hm. The metaphor about the professor is solid, but I think Claude just blows us around on a whim. Still, we owe him a lot.
Ignatz: I think that's beautiful, Marianne. I can really picture it. When the war is over, I'd love to paint a picture of those two. Oh! And of all the people we've fought with as well!
Leonie: You mean like a historical painting? I like that! Maybe our descendants will look at it a long, long time from now...
Lorenz: I must say, that piques my interest. I look forward to seeing how you portray my valiant efforts.
Leonie: When you put it that way, we may be witnessing one of the greatest events in FÃ³dlan's history. It's a lot of pressure, but the sense of duty I feel is even stronger than the fear.
Raphael: I'm just happy to be here with all of you! I won't get scared, no matter what we face!
Hilda: We have our goal. Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Let's get to work!

@Conversation 
Claude: My friend! The reinforcements the lords sent are finally gathering. Truth be told, Fort Merceus would've made for a better base of operation. But that weird pillar of light changes things. It's pretty scary, honestly... I wonder what it is...
Byleth: The rage of the goddess.
Claude: Well, that is how the legend goes in Ailell. If it really was the rage of the goddess, let's do our best not to enrage her even further.
Byleth: Some kind of magic. 
Claude: Makes sense. But whatever it was, I've never seen destructive power quite like it. I wonder where it came from...
Byleth: A natural phenomenon.
Claude: You think it's natural? What, the planet just up and decided to take a shot at the fort? I dunno, Teach.
Claude: Well, I guess pondering it is a waste of energy for now. Let's just get ready to move out. The capital is Edelgard's domain, so she has the advantage. It's going to be a tough battle.



Lorenz: I was taught from a young age to believe that the creed of Seiros was just the way of the world. To question it never even occurred to me. But Claude and Edelgard are different. They challenge the common wisdom. Even defy it. It is uncomfortable to discard familiar assumptions. But that is an essential quality of the visionary. Indeed, true greatness must lie beyond common sense. Hmm, that's good. I should write that down.



Raphael: We're heading up to Enbarr next. I hope I make it back safe so I can tell my little sis about it! I hear they got a neat opera house there where Manuela used to perform. What was it called again?
Byleth: Mitreflanc Opera Company.
Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!
Byleth: Mittlefrank Opera Company. 
Raphael: Ah, that's the one!
Byleth: Mildewplank Opera Company.
Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!
Raphael: My little sis always goes on about how much she'd like to see 'em perform. I know we can't see a show, but do you think we could at least see the building?



Ignatz: We're about to put the finishing touches on this war. I wonder how FÃ³dlan will look without the backdrop of death and destruction. I can't wait to see it! On the other hand, I'm terrified of what the future might hold. Who knows if I'll survive the assault on the capital?



Lysithea: Invading the capital and smashing the Empire. I wonder if doing so could really end this war. Care to share your thoughts, Professor?
Byleth: I think it'll end the war.
Lysithea: You say that with such confidence. I want to believe that it's true.
Byleth: I don't know. 
Lysithea: Perhaps you feel similarly to me. The whole mess puts me on edge.
Lysithea: Although for now, better to focus my efforts on the fight at hand.



Marianne: If we can win this war, then Claude will be the king of FÃ³dlan, and... Maybe he'll tear down the wall that separates FÃ³dlan from the outside world.
Byleth: Perhaps he will. 
Byleth: Perhaps he won't.
Marianne: I know it's hard to imagine... But I really hope he does. It would be so much better if people could live together instead of apart. I might even be able to live an ordinary life in the world Claude envisions...



Hilda: Fighting in the capital! Ugh! And we're fighting against Edelgard! Double ugh! But with you leading us, Professor, I know we'll win. Yeah! Wahoo! Fighting! I'm a little scared, to be honest. I'm just shouting to relieve the tension, but I'll be fine.



Leonie: We're finally going to the capital. This will be my chance to avenge Captain Jeralt. Once we smash the Empire, I'm sure his soul will finally be able to rest in peace.
Byleth: I think you're right. 
Byleth: Who can say for sure?
Leonie: Monica killed Captain Jeralt for the Flame Emperor, and the Flame Emperor was Edelgard. I know that the future of all FÃ³dlan rests on this battle. Nothing else is more important. But for me, this is personal. For Captain Jeralt's sake, I'm going to give it all I've got and more!



Ferdinand: Professor. At last, the end is nigh. I love the Empire. Part of me wants it to survive. But I know that is not reasonable. The Empire's time has come. What we need now is a mighty leader who can rebuild FÃ³dlan and rule it as a single nation. Nonetheless, it saddens me that we will not have an Adrestian emperor...



Linhardt: They used to call Enbarr the city of Seiros... To assault it, together with the knights, is surreal. If Seiros were alive today, I wonder what she might make of our war... In Enbarr, there was once a Southern Church, and apparently a bishop was dispatched to it. A hundred years ago, the Southern Church became entangled in an insurrection. Until five years ago, the Empire and the church maintained a certain distance from one another.



Caspar: It's such a relief that we've made it this far without having to fight my father.
Byleth: You'll have to face him at some point.
Caspar: Hey, don't try and scare me!
Byleth: It sounds like you're scared. 
Caspar: You bet I'm scared! The Imperial army hasn't lost a single battle with my father on the field!
Caspar: If he turns up as a reinforcement during the assault, we might lose. I better make my peace with that.


Bernadetta: Professor! My, um, my mother might be in the city. I don't have many good memories of her if I'm being honest, but she's dearer to me than my father. If you happen to see her, please make sure she's not caught up in all the fighting. She's only a civil servant, so hopefully she takes a cue from her Bernie and stays inside.



Dorothea: The whole of the capital is going to be a battleground. The city has such a long heritage... Even so, perhaps it deserves to be reduced to ashes for once. But we canât let the commonfolk get hurt. We should try to confine the damage to the noble section of town.



Petra: Five years ago...Edelgard said a thing to me. Brigid is a vassal of the Empire. But she also said I always have the freedom to be choosing whether I am with or not with her. I will become the ruler of Brigid. So she said I must make my own path. So now, my path and her path will be colliding.



Felix: The Death Knight is no ordinary knight. I will prey upon him. I will quench my blade's thirst with his blood. His focus is on fighting you, I'm sure. But mine will be the last face he sees.



Ashe: Those things appeared as soon as we got ourselves set up in Fort Merceus. Think what might have happened if they'd have hit us during the battle at Gronder Field. Assuming it was the work of the Imperial army...



Sylvain: So Enbarr, the Capital of the Empire. It's finally time. I never thought I'd live this long. It's like any battle, really--stay calm, stay focused. Don't give in to your enemy or your own fear.
Byleth: You seem more serious than usual.
Sylvain: Hey, I'm always serious! When I'm chasing girls or preparing for battle, always serious. That's me... 
Byleth: We'll get through this together.  
Sylvain: Striking down the Empire is my offering to His Highness. Heh, I left the Kingdom... What am I saying?



Mercedes: It's been so long since I've been to the Imperial capital. I used to go to the opera there with my mother and brother. I never thought my return would be like this...



Annette: Enbarr... Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I'd be returning like this. Of course, most of the nobles in the Empire make their home in the capital. In the Kingdom, all nobles live in their own domains. So if the capital is attacked, it doesn't necessarily affect them directly. What will happen to the Imperial nobles when their capital becomes a battlefield?



Ingrid: Once this battle is over, what will become of Faerghus and FÃ³dlan?
Byleth: Peace will reign. 
Ingrid: Peace, you say? It sounds so...foreign, so unattainable. But maybe, just maybe.
Byleth: What would you like to see happen?
Ingrid: My hope is for a world at peace. A world in which this present turmoil is a thing of the pastâthe stuff of legends.
Ingrid: I believe those who survive the atrocities of war have a duty to create a new, better world. So the sooner we can stamp out such turmoil, the better. We must win, Professor. There is no alternative here. I wonât allow for anything else.



Seteth: Rhea will be somewhere in the city. I wonder if she can sense us coming. If we are able to save her, then I expect you will learn many secrets that have hitherto been kept from you. Are you prepared for that?
Byleth: I am. 
Seteth: Excellent.
Byleth: I don't think I'm ready yet.
Seteth: That is unfortunate. Well, you must become ready.
Seteth: The battle will soon be upon us. Let us both be at our best for what is to come.



Flayn: I was born in Enbarr. My mother and father met in a church there. Not too long after, I was brought into the world. I do not understand how war can happen in such a precious place. It is most regrettable.



Hanneman: Enbarr's streets are paved with unhappy memories, Professor. I've avoided the damned place ever since I abandoned my nobility. Swore never to return. Now here we are. To return in this manner... Well, I can't say it is something I ever imagined.



Manuela: In the opera, actors came and went all the time. But the people behind the scenes would stay forever. I'll bet I'd know a few of them now, even after all these years.




Alois: Here we are, facing the final battle with the Empire. It's been a long, difficult struggle. We have to get Lady Rhea back! And we have to crush the Empire, in the name of Captain Jeralt. I don't know what comes next. But we can sort out those details later.



Catherine: Looks like we're nearing the end of this struggle. I'm sure Lady Rhea is on tenterhooks waiting for me to swoop in and rescue her.
Byleth: Probably. 
Catherine: I was just kidding! Pay me no mind.
Byleth: I doubt it.
Catherine: Oof... You don't mince your words. Try being a bit more mindful of other people's feelings.
Catherine: Lady Rhea's not waiting for me, I know, no matter how much I might wish she were. She's waiting for you.



Shamir: Ten years ago, Dagda and Brigid attacked the Empire from the west. The final target was the capital. But they were countered at a port town, long before they reached their destination. I guess our attempt has been more successful than theirs, all things considered.



Cyril: Whenever I think about how we'll be seeing Lady Rhea real soon, I get happy and really get cleaning! We'll get there for sure, right? We'll see her again?
Byleth: We'll meet her for sure. 
Byleth: We don't know for sure.
Cyril: I got gotta believe Lady Rhea is waiting for us in the capital... We just have to find her.



Balthus: Nader the Undefeated... With a name like that, he's bound to put up a damn-good fight. Did you get a good look at Judith? She practically had hearts floating out of her eyeballs when she looked at Nader.
Byleth: She must be in love. 
Balthus: You saw it too? Heh, I know that look well. She's got it bad. Honestly, they'd make a cute couple.
Byleth: I'm not so sure about that.
Balthus: Pretty dense, aren't ya? Trust me, pal. No one's seen more heart-eyed women than this guy. She's got it bad.
Byleth: That's ridiculous.
Balthus: Pretty dense, aren't ya? Trust me, pal. No one's seen more heart-eyed women than this guy. She's got it bad.
Balthus: It makes all the sense. Even seasoned warriors aren't immune to love, pal.



Judith: That Nardel guy... or Nader, I suppose. It was all some trick, and we fell for it. Hmph. I don't think the nickname The Undefeated applies is he flees from us. Though... maybe he only got that name by running away. Can't be defeated if you run off, right?



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Momentum's really picking up for this final battle, huh? Even I'm starting to feel tense! Me! Enbarr's history goes back 1,400 years. That even predates the founding of the Empire. It's one of the sacred sites of the Seiros faith, so it's a pretty big deal. But hey, no need to worry about the monastery while you're fighting the final battle. I've got it covered! I'll defend it to my last!

@Opening 
After making preparations at Garreg Mach, the Alliance army marches to Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. In response to the Alliance's movements, Emperor Edelgard orders her trusted retainer, Hubert, as well as the Death Knight, to the front lines to meet the Alliance army head-on. The two forces clash in the city streets.

Vastly outnumbered by Imperial forces, it becomes clear that a surprise attack, followed by a short and decisive battle, is the only path to victory. With this in mind, you stealthily approach Enbarr, the Imperial Capital.

@Intro 
Claude: There it is... Enbarr. The Imperial capital and the largest city in all of FÃ³dlan.
Judith: It's not just big. This city was designed to protect the castle where the emperor lives. It's as though the city itself is a massive stronghold.
Byleth: And the citizens?
Byleth: What is the state of affairs in the town?
Claude: They surely noticed us approaching some time ago, and yet...
Shamir: Our scouts confirmed the citizens haven't been evacuated. They're being kept in town.
Claude: I've got to hand it to Her Imperial Majesty. Using her citizens as a shield to protect the castle takes some resolve.
Lysithea: I suspect those mages will be lurking within as well...
Shamir: Troops deployed to other areas are also returning.
Judith: If we don't conquer the city quickly, things will get complicated fast.
Byleth: I hope we find Rhea...
Seteth: We can't search until we conquer the city. Let's focus on the fight for now.
Cyril: Lady Rhea, please be safe.
Claude: We've kept the Empire waiting long enough. Onward!

@Battle
Claude: We were told Hubert would be leading the enemy forces, but the Death Knight's also with them. We'll have to take care of both of them, but we won't have time to mop up all the enemy units. We'll have to split up and take them on at the same time, or risk being overrun by their reinforcements.

Imperial Soldier: It's here! The Crest of Flames banner! There! On the other side of the canal!
Hubert: Uninvited guests, I see. Heh. Let's ensure they receive a warm welcome. Ready the artillery. Prepare to attack. Rocks, arrows, magic - rain death upon the enemy until they are silent as the grave. Reinforcements will fly in shortly. Defend the heavy weapons until they arrive. 


Hubert: Our first wave of reinforcements is here. It will not be long until the next.
Claude: Reinforcements?! That was quick... We can't hang around or they'll just keep coming. We'll have to capture the artillery. We can turn them against their reinforcements...

Hubert: We have reinforcements coming in from another direction. Deploy them as soon as they arrive.

Claude: OK! Just Hubert left to deal with...
Hubert: We are taking heavy losses. We need more troops...

Claude: Well done, everyone! Now we can break through into Enbarr! We need to hurry up and attack the palace to block Edelgard's movements!

@Boss 
%Claude,Hubert 
Claude: It's over, lapdog. Your military rule is at its end.
Hubert: For every step you take along that path, our thorns will cut into your heels.
Claude: Ooh, that sounds painful. I'll have to wear thicker soles for the march.
Hubert: If your boots are too heavy, you won't be able to lift your feet. But enough prattle.

%Seteth,Death Knight
Seteth: You will not escape, Death Knight. Today you will be unmasked!
Death Knight: My true identity has no value.
Seteth: I will be the judge of that, once I've seen your face.

%Flayn,Death Knight
Flayn: So it's you, Death Knight! Remember me?!
Death Knight: You again. Here to lose more blood?
Flayn: Never! You will not lay a hand on me ever again!

%Claude,Death Knight
Claude: Hey, how long's it been? Five years? Who'd have thought you'd end up an Imperial general...
Death Knight: So, you wish to die.
Claude: Heh. As antisocial and unhinged as ever, I see.

%Mercedes,Death Knight
Mercedes: I came here to get you! Let's return together, Emile!
Death Knight: Leave! The place of your death is not here!

@End 
Claude: We've made it this far... Somehow. Edelgard is probably looking down on us from somewhere in that castle.
Leonie: I wonder if she's panicking or just smiling smugly...
Claude: From this point on, she'll be giving it her all too. Expect her to be tougher than the last time we fought. This battle will settle things once and for all. We'll attack as soon as everyone is ready.

Claude: Huh? Is that you, Dedue?!
Dedue: I heard the Alliance's army has entered the city. I've been searching for you ever since.
Byleth: How long have you been in Enbarr?
Dedue: I arrived not long after the battle at Gronder Field. I am here to kill Edelgard.
Byleth: What are you doing in Enbarr?
Dedue: I'm waiting for a chance to kill Edelgard. I have not yet been blessed with the opportunity.
Claude: Well, if you want to fight alongside us, we'd be more than happy to have you.

Dedue: We fight for different objectives. I swore to offer Edelgard's head to His Highness. But... Should I fail, I will have no choice but to entrust that mission to you. This is the information I have gathered during my time in hiding here. It includes details about the inside of the castle.

Claude: I appreciate this, but... What do you plan to do? Don't tell me you plan to do alone?
Dedue: I've done what I came here to do. Farewell.

Claude: Hey! Wait! He's gone. He's just as hard to understand as his liege was.
Claude: The time has finally come, my friend. Once we win this fight, the Empire will fall...
Byleth: What will become of FÃ³dlan?
Claude: What will become of it? Well, that's for us to decide, isn't it?
Byleth: What will we do about FÃ³dlan? 
Claude: The subject is heavy on my mind.
Claude: Odd as it sounds, I believe the forces responsible for destroying FÃ³dlan are also responsible for protecting the livelihood of its citizens. Everything, even the land itself, has been harmed by the chaos of war. Restoring it will be no easy feat. To do that, the first thing we need to think about is a new ruling system for all of FÃ³dlan.
Byleth: The Alliance lords could divide the territory.
Claude: No, I don't think that would work. The western half of the continent has little connection to the Alliance. Any attempt to force dominion on them would breed rebellion. The world would slide back into war once again.
Byleth: We could unify FÃ³dlan as one nation.
Claude: As usual, we're on the same page. I was thinking the same thing.
Claude: Even if the Alliance lords and any remaining influential nobles were to divide up dominion of all of FÃ³dlan... They would simply pursue their own interests. Another war would be inevitable. That's why there needs to be a powerful ruler who stands above them all and unifies FÃ³dlan as one nation.
Byleth: You should be that ruler, Claude.
Claude: If it means I can lead FÃ³dlan to a better future, I wouldn't mind that at all.
Byleth: We must search for a new ruler.
Claude: A new ruler, huh? I think I've got someone in mind.
Byleth: I should be that ruler.
Claude:  My friend... Do you really mean that?
Claude: My dreams await in a future where FÃ³dlan is no longer ravaged by war. There are things I want to see with you some day. I'll keep thinking about the best way to achieve that goal. Whatever we decide to do, we can't do it until we defeat the Empire. FÃ³dlan can't welcome a new dawn until we win the war. Let's prepare as best we can.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Claiming the monastery at Garreg Mach as its home base, the Alliance army joins forces with the Knights of Seiros. Together, they begin to take up arms against the Adrestian Empire.

@Dialogue 
Claude: Good work, Hilda! You didn't do much manual labor, but you managed to rope the knights into helping us restore the monastery.
Hilda: Thanks, Claude, but all I did was piggyback on your scheme. I saw your eyes telling me to make some magic happen!

Alois: Thank you so much for your help with the restoration.
Hilda: Oh please, it was nothing! We're just doing our part as former students.
Catherine: I'm told you even routed the bandits. That job should have fallen to us. I'm sorry for the trouble.
Claude: Hey, don't think twice about it. We're all allies in the resistance against the Empire, right?
Catherine: The church is at war with the Empire, but let's be realistic. Wouldn't it be better for the Alliance to eventually submit?
Claude: The way I see it, the emperor wants to take over all of FÃ³dlan and destroy the existing order of the world. I can't see her allowing the Alliance to continue to exist. We're in this just as deeply as you are. Actually... We were hoping to use this place as a base. The Empire begs to be meddled with, and we're first in line.
Alois: What? Why would you want to make your base here of all places?
Claude: Garreg Mach is situated in the center of FÃ³dlan, both geographically and spiritually. We want to secure this location while the Empire is still overlooking it.
Catherine: I see. The Empire doesn't see this place as important at the moment because it's far from the front lines.
Claude: But if we simply decide that it's ours to occupy, that does nothing to inspire the hearts and minds of the people of FÃ³dlan. Luckily, good ol' Teach has finally returned to us. If the Professor Rhea entrusted with the Sword of the Creator fights at our side... Well now. That's a just cause anyone could get behind. What's more, here we are, working alongside the legendary Knights of Seiros. It smacks of divine providence, doesn't it? Can you feel it?

Seteth: I have heard what you have to say, Claude. And you, Professor? Where do you stand?
Byleth: I will fight the Empire.
Seteth: Hm. On our own, we lack sufficient military strength. But with the help of the Alliance...
Byleth: I will find Rhea.
Seteth: Hm. We are at a relative standstill, but with the help of the Alliance...
Seteth: The archbishop said if anything should happen to her, that we should entrust the affairs of the church to you. If you intend to fight alongside the Alliance, then I will follow you as well. Is that acceptable, Claude?
Claude: Of course. I can't think of anything more reassuring than having both Teach and the knights on our side. Together, we'll stop the emperor and her reckless ambitions!

@Conversation 
Claude: Hey there, my friend. It's funny how the monastery was once in ruins, but now it's downright bustling. Thanks to a little promise five years ago, our buddies have all gathered, and even the knights have returned. It's like we were all just waiting for you to awaken. And now we're all going to band together against the Imperial army. You should go and talk to everyone, if you can. There may be some who are still on the fence.



Lorenz: I have written to my father to signal my intention to remain here. Not that I require his approval to do so. There is not much for me to gain by returning to Alliance territory now. But by staying, I will be able to influence the course of events directly, on the field of battle.
Byleth: Will you get along with the Alliance leader?
Lorenz: We will not be friends, but I will cooperate with him as much as is necessary to secure victory.
Byleth: Will you keep an eye on the Alliance leader? 
Lorenz: Naturally. Someone needs to make certain he does not lead the Alliance to ruin.



Raphael: Fighting alongside you and everyone else is a dream come true, Professor! And don't worry about my little sis. Right now she's back home helping out with the family business. I kinda figured I was gonna be stuck going back and taking over for her. But thanks to you and Claude, I get to work on my dream of becoming a proper knight!



Ignatz: It's been fixed up quite a bit, but it's battle scars aren't so easily erased... To think that a glorious cathedral, with a thousand year history... would end up like this. I'll rebuild this place someday. This cathedral is the symbol of FÃ³dlan. Maybe I should paint a picture of the beautiful cathedral of old, while I still remember what it looked like...



Lysithea: I've grown weary and impatient - these past five years, my hands have been bound. But now, I can finally take action with a clear goal. I'm grateful to you and to everyone.
Byleth: I didn't do anything. 
Lysithea: Nonsense. Your presence steeled everyone's resolve.
Byleth: And that goal is?
Lysithea: Down with the Empire! Surely peace will soon follow if the Empire is overthrown. Then my parents can finally find peace themselves.



Marianne: Even with the church in shambles, we can still pray. The goddess will surely hear our prayers, but still... I hope the church can return to it's former beauty someday.



Hilda: I'm pretty headstrong, but Claude could give me a run for my money. I mean, he's dragged the knights into this. You ought to be careful, Professor.
Byleth: I'll be fine.
Hilda: I wonder if you've got a hidden headstrong side? You must be hiding it really well though.
Byleth: You too. 
Hilda: Don't worry about me. I'm here because I want to be. Also because being around my big brother feels like a real chore.



Leonie: It's not just for my village that I'm fighting alongside you here, you know. It's also that Captain Jeralt asked me, his first and greatest apprentice, to look out for you. Of course, it wouldn't be enough just to keep you alive. It's my duty to make sure you win too. So do your best, Professor. And count on me to watch your back.



Ferdinand: I have lost my dominion. My nobility may seem like nothing more than a title. But I will never lose my noble heart. I will stop Edelgard, even if it costs me my life. I have turned my blade against her now. I cannot go back on that decision. Professor... Do you think I chose the wrong path?
Byleth: Not at all.
Byleth: We'll find out soon enough. 
Ferdinand: You are right...



Linhardt: The promise was made five years ago, but I must say I'm rather surprised how many of us managed to make it. Personally, I only showed up because I hoped to see you again, Professor. I've been with my family in the Empire until recently. I admit to feeling a little guilty betraying Her Majesty...but only a little. Now that we're all together again, I suppose the fighting will begin soon.



Caspar: Hey, Professor! You won't believe what happened! I figured I couldn't go back to the Empire after Garreg Mach fell, so I started drifting across the Kingdom and Alliance. Then, I just happened to run into our old class, so we came back to the monastery together!


Bernadetta: Ah, at last, I return to my domain! My lonely paradise! My realm of exquisite Solitude! Huh? Professor? Is that, um. Is that you? You, um. You didn't hear that just now, did you?
Byleth: Sorry.
Bernadetta: Oh! Forget you heard anything!
Byleth: Hear What? 
Bernadetta: Right. You didn't? Well, um. Good.



Dorothea: Laaa-la-laaa-la-laaa... Professor! Oh my! It's so good to see you. These days, so many old friends seem to be disappearing. But you... You're here! It's incredible to see you again after five years! I have a feeling your name will go down in history.



Petra: Edelgard is controlling the Empire. She is putting the pressure on the Kingdom and Alliance. Empire and religion are at open war. It will be... difficult for us at first. But corrupt nobles are many. That means the common people will rebel and be joining our side. With you, Professor, the battle tides will...ah, will turn. I have certainty.



Felix: A country with no king has no future. That's why I made my way here. Professor, don't let me down.
Byleth: Country with no king?
Felix: Hmph. You'll understand soon enough.
Byleth: Let's forge ahead. 
Felix: Yes, let's. Find me a worthy opponent to battle and I'll be content.



Sylvain: I'm the heir of House Gautier, and I'm fighting alongside a bunch of Alliance people? I can just imagine my father's face contorted in anger and the delightful words he must have used to describe me. I don't know how standing and fighting for Faerghus would have helped. Sorry, Professor. I don't regret my decisions. I'm just thinking out loud. And I'm hoping I haven't made a big mistake.



Mercedes: You're here, Professor, along with everyone from our old class. It's like we've gone back in time! When I think that I'll be around you again, all of my sorrows just drift away.
Byleth: Frankly, I don't feel too happy.
Mercedes: Hmm, I understand. Especially with Lady Rhea missing...It sounds like the Kingdom and Empire have been in a sorry state too. But we can't let that get us down!
Byleth: Let's do our best together.
Mercedes: Hmm, yes. I'll at least try not to hold anyone back.
Mercedes: Let's work together for the common good, like we did five years ago!



Annette: Members of the knights tell me that Father left their ranks five years ago. They say he announced he was returning to the Kingdom, but nobodyâs heard from him since. I havenât received word that he went back to Mother... Where could he be... Where are you, Father...



Ingrid: Professor. I have a proposal. Why not go beyond the Knights of Seirosâinstead, uniting with allies from all across FÃ³dlan to fight for our cause? Looking back, it would have been best to ally with the Kingdom and join forces against the Empire. But now the Kingdom is not exactly... Well...



Seteth: Five long years, I've searched for you and the archbishop. It's a pleasure to see you again. The Church of Seiros will follow you from now on, but please do not abandon the search for Lady Rhea.
Byleth: We'll do whatever it takes to find her. 
Seteth: Thank you. I know the battles ahead will be dire, but we will support you with all our strength.
Byleth: We don't know what the future will bring.
Seteth: Wherever she is, Rhea is doubtlessly waiting for you. Please do not let her down.



Flayn: Professor, I am so glad you are unharmed! No matter the path you walk, I will be with you every step of the way. Anything you ask of me, I shall see it through. You saved my life, and I am in your debt.



Hanneman: Thankfully, it appears the records and equipment I need for my research have not been damaged. I am most curious though. You say you were asleep for five whole years? Incredible. Perhaps this is another effect of your Crest. I do look forward to investigating you in greater detail.
Byleth: We can talk about that. 
Hanneman: Wonderful news! I am most excited to begin. We must find the time, of course.
Byleth: Uh, maybe later...
Hanneman: I'll have to be content with observing you wherever you go, then. I cannot waste any opportunity!



Manuela: My, Professor. You haven't changed a bit! At your age, I'd expect your whole demeanor to have changed greatly over five years... Though I suppose I haven't changed either, right? Thank you for noticing, by the way. Ah, Just the two of us, forever young. Oh, let me have my fun.



Alois: I'd given up on ever seeing you again. Where have you been hiding? Anyway, now that we're reunited in the land of the living, I must fulfill my promise!
Byleth: What promise?
Alois: The promise I made to the captain! to keep you safe! I can't believe you've forgotten. How cold...
Byleth: Right, the Promise. 
Alois: That's right! I promised the captain I'd protect you in his stead, and now I'll make good on my word!



Catherine: In Lady Rhea's absence, I will follow you. That's what she would want me to do. Know that wherever you might lead us, I'll continue searching for Lady Rhea.
Byleth: That's fine. 
Catherine: Good, because I will not budge on that point. Welcome back, Professor.
Byleth: Sounds like a lot of trouble.
Catherine: I don't care how much trouble it is! I will rescue Lady Rhea, at all costs.



Shamir: I'm more of a mercenary than a knight these days. I work to get paid. I never was too attached to FÃ³dlan. I was considering leaving soon... But I might change my mind if you're around.



Cyril: I don't know anything about rebuilding, but I can sure do my best to clean up the mess. I'm gonna keep Lady Rhea's room spotless, so she can use it right away whenever she gets back. You gotta find her, Professor. You just gotta.



Anna: There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! You know, it's such a thrill to be able to greet you like this again! I almost died as well in the battle five years ago, but I won't allow any enemies to get into this place again, I promise you that! Even if the Death Knight shows up, I'll be sure to... Well, for now I'll keep training so I can eventually feel confident that I can stop him!


@Intro 
Claude: Everyone, listen up! I have a proposal. We are now building our forces in order to rise up against the Imperial army. But it wouldn't be smart for us to fight under the banner of the Alliance. That would only incite the lords who support the Empire. We've also combined forces with the Knights of Seiros. Therefore, I suggest that we operate under a new symbol. That's why I've prepared this...

Claude: You may recognize it as the Crest of Flames, which resides in Teach. The phantom Crest that has reappeared after more than 1,000 years. We're attempting our own miracle, so it seems like a suitable symbol for us. So... Until we welcome the dawn of a new age in FÃ³dlan... Let's fight to the very end, as one, under the symbol of the Crest of Flames!
Hilda: Impressive, Claude. Forget restoring the monastery. You've somehow roped everyone into fighting back against the Empire!
Claude: If you recall, I never asked anyone to join us. If anything, we have Teach's achievements to thank. Now that you mention it, I guess I should express my gratitude.


Claude: Hey, friend. So this is where you've been. Without you, the knights never would have joined our cause. I could never pay you back for that.
Byleth: You're welcome.
Byleth: Let's do our best.
Claude: Just leave it to me, Teach. When this fight is over, I plan to see all of my dreams come to fruition, and yours as well.
Byleth: What are you dreams, Claude?
Claude: Well, for example... to bust open FÃ³dlan's Throat. There's a massive fortress there, which is responsible for protecting the eastern border of the Alliance. I like to think of it as a lid on a bottle. The people of FÃ³dlan only know a small part of the world. Their prejudices are born because they don't know what lies beyond their borders. And the opposite is true too. Those outside of FÃ³dlan don't know about this place. Ignorance breeds discrimination. Whether you look inside the bottle or outside of it... If you really look, all you find are people who you can get along with, if you only try. That's why I wanna bust open that lid, which is keeping us locked inside. Or destroy the bottle entirely.
Byleth: Are you going to tell our allies about this?
Claude: I'll find the right time to bring it up. Even if I talked about it now, it doesn't seem realistic, does it? First we need to defeat the Empire and restore peace to... Huh?
Leonie: Professor! Claude! We're under attack!
Claude: I guess we'll have to cut our conversation short. What's going on, Leonie?
Leonie: It's a small group, but some Imperial troops are headed this way. It looks like they were stationed nearby.
Claude: I got to hand it to Edelgard. Nothing gets past that woman.
Byleth: We should proceed cautiously. 
Claude: As long as we don't let our guard down, there's no way they can defeat us.
Byleth: Let's take them down. 
Leonie: All right! I'll show you how much I've improved, Professor!
Claude: This will be our first battle alongside the Knights of Seiros. Let's kick off our new partnership with a magnificent victory!

@Opening
Though plans to resist the Empire are still being devised by the Alliance army, the Imperial army has already anticipated their next move. An Imperial vanguard, just outside Garreg Mach, led by General Randolph, begins to advance with the aim of toppling the monastery once again.

Fulfilling a promise made five years ago, your former students gather once more at the monastery, as do the knights. However, your joyful reunion is cut short...

@Battle 
Randolph: The Knights of Seiros are a powerful enemy, but we have more soldiers. We'll take them down all at once!
Claude: So, the enemy intends to use their overwhelming numbers to defeat us. Let's fight fire with... actual fire.

Knight of Seiros: Report! The enemy has entered the periphery of Garreg Mach!
Claude: If they reach the interior, the enemy will take the monastery. Drive them back immediately!

Imperial Soldier: What? That strange battle flag is... But isn't our enemy the Church of Seiros?
Randolph: They didn't have enough soldiers with just the church, so they upped their numbers by joining with those filthy rogues. It doesn't matter what flag they fly. They're nothing more than a mob. We'll destroy them all!


Claude: Allied soldiers are making preparations for the plan. Protect them!

Claude: What? The fire attack unit was routed?! Damn it...my brilliant plan failed.
Randolph: It looks like they were planning something, but it failed!

Claude: We're prepared for the fire attack. Now we just need to draw the enemy's attention. You can't defeat us with that many soldiers? The Imperial army is doomed without a capable general!
Randolph: Quiet! Don't think you'll get away with mocking me! Attack! Make sure they never speak again!
Claude: Now!

Randolph: Argh, a fire attack... The damage is too great. We can't fight anymore! All units, retreat! I'll take on our pursuers! Carry away the injured soldiers!


Claude: If we let them escape, they'll come back to attack later. We have to take them out!


Randolph: A total loss... But we can't just return home like this...
Claude: Teach, look out! They're after your head!

@End 
Claude: Phew! Nice work. We won without much incident, thanks to all of you.
Knight of Seiros: I don't think the Empire will leave us alone now. What do you plan to do?
Claude: I intend to ask the Alliance lords to share some troops with us to bolster our forces.
Lorenz: I will speak plainly. No matter whom we beseech for reinforcements, our envoys will inevitably pass through Gloucester territory. My father is being cautious not to give the Empire a pretext to intervene. Therefore, he is unlikely to allow even envoys to pass through.
Byleth: Why not request reinforcements from the Kingdom?
Claude: Ah... I guess I haven't told you yet, Teach. The Kingdom isn't in a position to be sending anyone reinforcements. After losing King Lambert during the Tragedy of Duscur, a Regent had been handling it's politics. But then... There was a bloody coup. The Regent and Prince Dimitri both... Apparently the whole family was killed. All Blaiddyd territory, including the Kingdom capital, is being ruled by those who are cooperating with the Empire. The Kingdom is no more. It's not called the Faerghus Dukedom. The vast majority of the former Kingdom lords bent a knee to the overwhelming power of the Empire and the Dukedom, and now fall under their jurisdiction.
Claude: Some who formerly held power are continuing to resist, but it would be difficult for them to regain it.
Hilda: Oh, hey! I can think of one person who we can ask for reinforcements. Someone whose territory is really close, and who's on good terms with Claude...
Lysithea: Ah! The Hero of Daphnel, I presume?
Leonie: I've seen her before, and she does seem to be reliable.
Marianne: You're talking about Judith, right? I bet she would lend us a hand...
Byleth: She seems intimidating.
Byleth: She seems strong.
Claude: That's right, you've met her once before, Teach. She's a fearsome one-woman army. She did a lot for me, even before I was recognized as the heir to House Riegan. I don't like the idea of owing her more than I already do, but given the situation, sacrifices must be made. I'll reach out to her. As for the rest of you, prepare for our next battle.

Claude: Heya, Teach. How are you feeling? Does anything feel, um... strange at all?
Byleth: Nothing in particular.
Claude: Good. I still vividly remember you suddenly collapsing and passing out after you went through those changes. But maybe that's not a concern now that you've spent five long years napping.
Byleth: I feel a bit sluggish.
Claude: Well, you were asleep for five whole years, after all. It'll probably take time to get you back to top form. Though I'm relieved to see you haven't lost a step as far as combat goes.
Claude: Your command bringing my schemes to life... That's just how we fight best.
Byleth: Any word from Judith?
Claude: Not yet, but there's no need to worry. That woman adores me. Once we've bolstered our forces, it'll finally be time to start taking decisive action. But I wonder... Do you really think Rhea is still alive?
Byleth: She's alive.
Claude: I think so too. It's hard to imagine the death of someone as important as her staying a secret.
Byleth: I don't know.
Claude: There's no telling. But it's also hard to imagine the death of someone as important as her staying a secret.
Claude: I wonder where she is and what she's doing...
Byleth: Do you hope she's alive?
Claude: All I know is that I still have a lot of questions I need to ask her.
Byleth: Do you hope she's dead? 
Claude: That's a dangerous question, Teach. To be honest, I've given it a lot of thought. All I know is that I still have a lot of questions I need to ask her.
Claude: About the true history of Crest Stones and Heroes' Relics... and the truth behind the legend of Seiros and Nemesis. She has secrets. Too many of them for my comfort. Considering the state of the world... it's suspicious. You must be curious about what was done to you and what her plans were for you, right? And you never did learn about your mother, did you? None of our doubts will ever be clear unless we hear these answers from Rhea herself. In that sense, I absolutely hope Rhea is still alive. But as far as FÃ³dlan goes, I do wonder what a world without Rhea would look like.
Byleth: A world without Rhea?
Claude: The majority of people in FÃ³dlan believe in the Seiros faith that Rhea preaches. That's why they accept the noble system as if it were the only option, and refuse to associate with those who believe in anything else. That closed-minded philosophy is the reason why FÃ³dlan's Throat is locked tight. But if you remove the archbishop who strictly advocates that doctrine, that world view is no longer absolute. There's room for free thought. The leadership of the church would undoubtedly fall to you, and you would hold the power to change the shape of the faith. Of the world. Then, for the first time, people would truly be free to think for themselves. To decide what's right, and what's wrong. Honestly, I believe Edelgard is probably hoping to achieve something very similar. But her methods require too much bloodshed. That's not something the world can get behind. Anyway... The best thing we can do is find Rhea and hear what she has to say. Heh, oops... I guess I've been going on for a while now. Sorry about that. You should get some rest.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
The Alliance army successfully rendezvous with Judith in Ailell. With the addition of House Daphnel's forces, the time has come to invade Empire territory.

@Intro 
Claude: Preparations are complete. Now it's a game of patience. As they say, good things come to those who wait.
Lorenz: Care to elaborate on this plan of yours, Claude? Can we really do this without battling my father?
Claude: Pretty soon, Count Gloucester will need to gather his troops in the northern part of his territory.
Byleth: Against the Kingdom?
Claude: The Kingdom has experience constant infighting since the coup. They're out of the picture for now.
Byleth: Against Houses Riegan and Daphnel? 
Claude: You got it, Teach!
Judith: The combined forces of the Riegan and Daphnel houses will threaten the northern part of the Gloucester territory. Nardel, that retainer I mentioned, is going to draw their attention.
Claude: We'll take that opportunity to make our way through Gloucester territory and launch a surprise attack on the Great Bridge of Myrddin.
Lorenz: And...are you not concerned about the possibility that I may tip off my father?
Claude: The future of the Alliance rests on this battle. I'm certain you won't betray us.
Lorenz: Hmph. I will ensure our success.
Claude: I know you will. If we win this fight, then our next goal will be to topple Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. I said before that my plan was to meddle with the Empire, but I'm going to do you one better. We are going to defeat the Empire, once and for all. But to do that, we can't afford to slip up here. Bear that in mind and prepare yourselves for the coming battle.

@Conversation 
Claude: If our plan succeeds, we'll arrive at the Great Bridge of Myrddin unscathed. The important part is what happens next. We're evenly matched in terms of military power, more or less, so if we can just launch a surprise attack...
Byleth: We have the advantage.
Claude: I wouldn't be so sure. That bridge is almost like a fortress. The defense there is rock solid.
Byleth: It could go either way. 
Claude: Agreed. The bridge is basically a fortress, so the defense will be rock solid.
Byleth: We'll still be at a disadvantage.
Claude: I'll give you that the bridge is basically a fortress. I wouldn't say we're at a loss, but we certainly shouldn't rest easy.
Claude: But that's why you're here, Teach! No matter the odds, you're the wild card we need to win!



Lorenz: I would like to believe that I have always made my own decisions. Even so, I cannot deny that some small part of me has always been aware of my father's wishes. Now, here I am. Concealing our plan - Claude's plan - from his sight.
Byleth: Are you having second thoughts?
Lorenz: No. The strategy is sound, and I've consented to it.
Byleth: You're not reluctant, though, are you? 
Lorenz: Quite the contrary, honestly. I feel as though a fog has finally lifted from my eyes.
Lorenz: In this fight, I will finally stand upon my own two feet, independent of my father's influence.



Raphael: Thanks to all that food from Judith, I'm full for once! I've got so much energy! Let me at that Great Bridge of Myrddin! I'll bust it down myself! Oh, but then how do we cross?



Ignatz: The Great Bride of Myrddin isn't just a bridge. It has the features of a fortress. I believe it was built for military purposes by the first leader of the Adrestian Empire. In other words, it's even older than the monastery. So if we occupy the Great Bridge, we'll have to search it from top to bottom.



Lysithea: I'm sure you know this already, but House Ordelia is aligned with the Empire. They face the Empire from across a river, similar to the Gloucesters. Even so, I refuse to yield to the Empire a second time. The Empire did unthinkable things to my family. And to me. The only option here is winning. Professor, you must promise we will overcome the Empire.



Marianne: Legend says that pillars of light fell and ravaged Ailell. I was reminded of that when I saw it... Um, Professor? Do you think those legends are true?
Byleth: It's likely.
Marianne: I think so too. I don't know if the goddess really destroyed the valley out of anger, but...
Byleth: Yes, and it'll likely happen again. 
Marianne: Oh! I suppose you may be right. There's no way to be sure it won't...
Marianne: There's still so many things we don't understand in this world.



Hilda: It looks like people are slowly starting to come back to the town. I guess they feel safe now that you and the Knights of Seiros have returned. Peddlers have become more common too, so there'll be food and supplies available. After being run-down for all those years, it's really becoming livable again!



Leonie: Things have gotten a lot more interesting since we've joined up with Judith, haven't they? Anyone who casually treats Claude like he's just some kid is not a person to be trifled with. I think Captain Jeralt would have liked her. I hope someday I can be as strong, kind, and levelheaded as her.



Ferdinand: What used to be Aegir territory lies far to the east of the Great Bridge of Myrddin, downstream of the Airmid River. For the sake of my family, I wish we could invade the Empire from there. But I do not have the power to advocate for that. Strategically, Myrddin is more important.
Byleth: Someday, we'll take it back. 
Ferdinand: Thank you, Professor. I will not give in. Not until I have restored my noble pride!
Byleth: Taking it back would be difficult.
Ferdinand: Yes, I know it would be difficult, but I will not give in!



Linhardt: Since I'm originally from the Empire, it seems no one trusts me with any important tasks. Fine by me. Honestly, I'd bet they're watching my every move to make sure I can be trusted.
Byleth: I'm sure they're not...
Linhardt: If I were leading the Alliance, it's what I would do.
Byleth: Probably. 
Linhardt: I knew it. War makes people crazy, huh?



Caspar: The Airmid River separates the Empire and Alliance. It's the largest river in FÃ³dlan. Sometimes it'll flood when there's lots of rain, but... At least the land gets some extra water!


Bernadetta: War isn't kind to you if you're a recluse. By the time you realize what's going on, you're already under attack. And if you're off by yourself, you can get killed with no one ever even finding out.
Byleth: Sounds like you're learning.
Byleth: Isn't that a little pessimistic? 
Bernadetta: Oh, that'd be awfulâjust terrible! OK, Professor, I get it. I know I'll have to come out.



Dorothea: We're going to invade the Empire...which means we'll be fighting people we know, won't we? If we're attacked by someone we know, or used to think of as a friend, it is permitted to run away?
Byleth: No, it's not OK.
Dorothea: Makes sense. A commander running away would be terrible for morale.
Byleth: I wouldn't blame you. 
Dorothea: Really? If something happens, will you keep me safe?



Petra: If we can suppress this Myrddin, we can invade into the Empire, right? I was in the Empire. Now I will be an enemy... I am having strange feelings. It is with ease that an ally turns into an enemy...



Felix: We can predict what the Empire will do. Faerghus is our real problem. The eastern lords have joined forces and are warring with the Dukedom. But I've heard nothing about that conflict as of late. It's strange. I haven't heard much from my father either. I can't help but find this silence unsettling...



Ashe: It's thanks to you that I'm here now. I owe you, Professor. You saved my life. I swear I'll do all I can to repay that debt.



Sylvain: I had an encounter with Lord Gwendal... How many years ago was it? Back before the academy, I met this girl who I fell madly in love with...and her dad tried to kill me. I suppose he just tried to scare me, but I was sure I was going to die. Oh yeah, her dad? Lord Gwendal. Crazy, right? I never thought I'd seriously be trying to kill the guy in battle. I kind of don't know how to make sense of it.



Mercedes: Lady Rhea is in the Empire, isn't she? We should hurry up and find her. So many people in the monastery and nearby towns are worried...I want to ease their minds as soon as possible, Professor. Let's work together to find her!



Annette: Next we face the Great Bridge of Myrddin... We actually crossed it a long time ago. Do you remember? It was five whole years ago!
Byleth: During the Battle of the Eagle and Lion? 
Annette: It seems like so long ago, doesn't it? It's odd how fast time flies...
Byleth: When we went to Remire Village?
Annette: What are you talking about, Professor? It was on the way to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion!
Annette: Everyone was still friends then. After the fighting, we all ate together without splitting into our separate houses. But now we're fighting the same people who were our friends back then... Even Ashe... I often wish we could go back to those peaceful days...



Ingrid: So, that was Judith. Just as Iâd heard of her, she was an upstanding person. The same Daphnel blood runs through my veins, and yet I feel as though I am nothing like her. I am a phantom of what could be...
Byleth: You're actually quite alike. 
Ingrid:  You think so? Wow, thank you!
Byleth: True, you do differ.
Ingrid: If only I could be half of who she is.



Seteth: If Rhea really is in the Empire, then we must defeat the Imperial army by any means necessary. The people at large are just as concerned for Rhea's safety as we are. The sooner we can settle all our unease, the better.



Flayn: Judith is a wonderful person. So strong and confident, as well. Looking upon her, I am sharply reminded of my mother.
Byleth: Does she look similar?
Flayn: Not in the slightest. Rather, it is her way of being - her demeanor. Brilliantly bright and positive, like a warm ray of light.
Byleth: Does she act similar? 
Flayn: Very much so! Both brilliantly bright and positive, like a warm ray of light.
Flayn: I... lost my mother, long ago. I miss her desperately.



Hanneman: The battle at Ailell was a tactical marvel. You grow stronger with each passing day. Where does your talent end and your Crest's power begin? Are they one and the same, I wonder? Most intriguing. Yet it is quite difficult to draw useful conclusions, given the situation. It is quite unfortunate I did not achieve my research goals before the war broke out. So much unknown. Now, I fear I will not have those answers even by conflict's end. So very frustrating.



Manuela: Oh, hello there, Professor. Did you need something from me? It doesn't look like you're wounded or anything. You just looking for... someone to talk to?
Byleth: Yes. 
Manuela: I thought so. Well, I'm here for you! Making you feel better is my top priority.
Byleth: No.
Manuela: Come on now, you don't have to be shy. Helping you feel better is important to me.
Manuela: Whether it's physical pain or worries of the heart, you can come to me for anything, Professor.



Alois: So, Lady Rhea was in the Empire all this time. Glad as I am that Judith told us, I wish we had known this five years ago. We spent all that time spread out over FÃ³dlan, searching for the archbishop and you. It was a mistake to abandon the monastery, to leave it in ruins. Now we're paying for that mistake.



Catherine: I'd heard of the Hero of Daphnel, but that was the first time I've met her in person. She's the head of a prestigious noble family? Just like Claude. The Alliance nobility is so... odd.
Byleth: You don't think she acts like a noble?
Byleth: Is it different in the Kingdom and Empire? 
Catherine: Kind of, but I don't mean that in a bad way. You won't find such big-hearted nobles elsewhere. Plus, Judith can drink with the best of 'em! A woman after my own heart.



Shamir: Five years ago, when the Imperial army attacked Garreg Mach, they moved with incredible speed. But in the middle of all that chaos, she still had operatives watching. The Hero of Daphnel's spy network is impressive. She shouldn't be taken lightly.



Cyril: Is it true Lady Rhea was dragged off by the Imperial army? I heard that was true. Why'd they take Lady Rhea? Professor... they didn't take her to kill her, did they?
Byleth: I don't think so.
Cyril: That's good. We just gotta beat the Imperial army and get her back, right?
Byleth: They probably haven't killed her.
Cyril: Yeah, good point. If they did, we'd have heard about it by now.
Cyril: You gotta help her, Professor. I'm begging ya.



Judith: I don't know where he recruited that man, but Claude's got an eye for great talent. I'm talking about his retainer, Nardel. I've only spoken with him briefly, but he seems to have a fair amount of both brains and brawn, with the skills to match. But there's something about him I can't quite place... Like I've somehow heard of him before...



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! I was talking to some of the Daphnel soldiers earlier, and it seems that Judith has a weakness. But they wouldn't tell me what it is! I got the feeling they didn't appreciate the question. Pardon me for being curious! That said, maybe keep this to yourself. Not that she terrifies me to my soul, but I'd hate to get on her bad side...

@Intro 
Lorenz: The Great Bridge of Myrddin is in sight. Beyond it, the Empire.

Cyril: Whaddya know. There aren't bridges that big in Almyra, that's for sure...
Lysithea: How unsettling. There are bridges in the southern part of Ordelia territory, but nothing like this.
Claude: It's the most strategic location in that area to move a large army across the Airmid River. The Empire will want to hold on to it at all costs, so expect tough defenses.
Byleth: Let's finish this quickly. 
Lysithea: You're right. The enemy's guard should be down, so let's end this quickly before they have a chance to retaliate.
Byleth: Let's proceed with caution. 
Ignatz: You're right. The defenses are pretty impenetrable. Let's make our move carefully.
Claude: You're in command, Teach. Do whatever it takes to win. Well, other than sacrificing the lives of our allies for the sake of victory. Try to avoid that. Let's get moving. We're counting on you, my friend.

@Opening 
Sights set on the Imperial capital, the Alliance army chooses to march through the territory of House Gloucester - supporters of the Empire. Under the command of Nardel, the retainer of House Riegan, the defensive forces of House Riegan and Daphnel draw out the Gloucester troops. Thus the Alliance army can continue its march towards the Great Bridge of Myrddin and cross the Airmid river, which separates the Alliance and the Empire.

After fending off the Empire, your forces decide it's time to advance. But first, you must capture the Great Bridge of Myrddin, a strategic crossing point over the Airmid River, which borders the Alliance and the Empire.

@Battle 
Ladislava: That symbol... It's an enemy raid! Stay calm and face them head-on. Send a messenger to Acheron immediately! If we're quick, we might be able to pull off a pincer attack!
Claude: They say the enemy general, Ladislava, is among Edelgard's most trusted. Let's see what she's got.

Claude: Our goal is to take down Ladislava and gain control of the bridge. Let's go!

Imperial Soldier: You think we'll let you take this bridge from us?
Claude: Whoa, new enemies from the central fortress? By the looks of it, that might not be all of them.


Ladislava: Acheron! Now's the time to show your loyalty to the Empire! Attack the enemy from behind!
Acheron: I've got to make my name known to her Majesty through distinguished service.
Claude: Acheron the Weathervane. He's of the Alliance. He's a minor noble who holds territory to the north of Myrddin. If he's gonna support the Empire, no need to hold back. He's nothing but a nuisance, even to the Alliance.

Claude: Looks like we can capture this fortress quickly if we take out the soldiers protecting it.
Imperial Soldier: Enemies approaching! Get the soldiers standing by to join the fight! We may need to hurry up preparations of the ballista too. Protect the fortress!

Alliance General: We'll ally ourselves with the Imperial soldiers too!

Ferdinand: I will leave this area to the reinforcements, and then I will swing around to provide support from the south.

Claude: I'm glad we defeated them here... I doubt they're an enemy we could win against twice.

@Boss 
%Claude,Acheron
Acheron: The declining Alliance will be finished if I kill you. The Empire will herald the new age!
Claude: Only if you manage to kill me. Hm? What's that to the north? Looks like the home of another opportunistic noble is burning...
Acheron: That's... that's my castle! NO!
Claude: That's the declining Alliance at work, right there. Seems like you were facing the wrong way, Weathervane!

@End 
Claude: Well done, everyone. The Great Bridge of Myrddin is ours.
Leonie: I was prepared for bloodshed, but that was more than expected... I guess I'm still not used to this.
Ignatz: Even our enemies were fighting for their own cause. They held out without fleeing until the bitter end...
Byleth: You don't have to get used to it. 
Leonie: That is true. I wouldn't want to become the type of person who feels nothing when someone dies.
Byleth: We must overcome this. 
Ignatz: Yes... we can't afford to stall here.
Claude: Now it's on me to return to Alliance territory and convince those lords to join us. Lorenz, would you return home for the time being and lay the groundwork with your father?
Lorenz: Fine. After all, this is for the Alliance. Or rather, for all of FÃ³dlan.
Claude: For those of you who live in Alliance territories, I ask that you return to your houses, and spread the word about the current situation. Until we finish our preparations, Judith and the knights will do everything in their power to defend the Great Bridge.
Judith: That's a casual way to dole out such a deadly mission, boy.
Claude: Do you object?
Judith: Just who do you think I am? I won't let the Empire pass this way, even if it costs me my life.
Claude: Too bad you're not allowed to die. Fight like your life depends on it, but flee if you're ever truly in danger.
Judith: A tall order, as always. I'll use my best discretion, Claude.
Seteth: We have no objections either. Go forth and secure us a sufficiently powerful army.
Raphael: I'll stay here too. The only ones I'd be going home to are my little sis and my grandpa.
Claude: Are you sure you don't want to see your sister? It may be a while before you can return home again.
Raphael: But if I see her, I may not want to come back. So I'll wait till I'm done here.
Byleth: What about me?
Byleth: I'll stay here too.
Claude: Actually, I'd like for you to come with me, Teach. To help negotiate with the lords. They're followers of the Church of Seiros, after all. It'll make things easier if we have someone there to speak on Rhea's behalf. All right, everyone. Let's meet back at the monastery next month. Good luck out there.

???: Is that you, kiddo?
Claude: I have returned, Nardel.
Nardel: Oh, ah, Master Claude. It's you. I mistook you for one of the local children. My apologies.
Claude: It seems you have adjusted to your work here. Our recent strategy was successful, thanks to you.
Nardel: I was a bit concerned when House Goneril's army intervened from the east.
Claude: Count Gloucester must have requested reinforcements from them.
Nardel: Yes, and they have that young general who won some acclaim from his battles in Almyra... Regardless, they showed no signs of seriously wishing to attack us, and merely fulfilled their obligations to House Gloucester.
Nardel: Now then... who is this lovely lady?
Claude: This is my professor, who I asked to join me at the roundtable conference. Teach, this is Nardel, that retainer Judith was talking about.
Byleth: Nice to meet you.
Nardel: Hm, how polite. I've heard good things about you from Master Claude.
Byleth: ...
Nardel: You'll make me blush if you keep staring like that. Though I suppose people like me are something of a rarity here.
Claude: As you can see, he wasn't born in FÃ³dlan. Still, trust me when I say he is highly capable.
Nardel: True. In fact, my capability is my only redeeming quality. I hope you'll continue to look after Master Claude, Professor.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
It is Imperial Year 1185. Nearly five years have passed since the fall of the monastery at Garreg Mach, and war continues to plague the lands of FÃ³dlan. Fhirdiad has been captured. The Holy Kingdom of Faerghus is in shambles. The Leicester Alliance is on the verge of collapse, fractured by two opposing factionsâthose who support the Adrestian Empire and its ruler, and those who seek her demise. Meanwhile, under Emperor Edelgardâs rule of law, the Adrestian Empire continues to expand its reach. The path to a new FÃ³dlan, unified by Imperial strength, may yet be in sight.

@Cutscene 
Claude: Huh?

Claude: You overslept, Teach. Pretty rude to keep a fella waiting like that, wouldn't you say?

Claude: What's with that surprised look, my friend?

Claude: You didn't really think I'd given up â on you coming back, did you?

Claude: Can you feel it? A new dawn is finally here. Not just for us, though. No, for all of FÃ³dlan.

@Dialogue
Claude: It's been five long years. Where have you been, Teach? You don't really expect me to believe that you've been napping this whole time, do you?
Byleth: I was sleeping.
Byleth: I don't remember.
Claude: That's a good one! Except... That's not your lying face. I guess I've got no choice but to believe you. You're not exactly normal to begin with, so it's not a huge stretch to imagine you sleeping for that long. Aaand this is where you say, just kidding. Right? If this is a rib, now's the time to fess up.
Byleth: It's the truth.
Claude: You must be insane. And yet... Fine. I believe you, OK? But that means you don't know anything that happened after your last battle, right?

Claude: I guess it's on me to catch you up. As you can see, Garreg Mach was crushed by the Empire and was never restored. The monastery is in ruins, and the town is in pretty bad shape too. Can you guess why?
Byleth: Rhea has been sleeping too?
Claude: Huh. It would seem that's one possible explanation, since you insist that's what you've been up to.
Byleth: Rhea has died?
Claude: Her body was never found, and the Empire never declared that she had been killed. So... No telling.
Claude: All we know for sure is that Rhea suddenly vanished during that battle five years ago. The Knights of Seiros have apparently been searching all over FÃ³dlan for her... But the fact that this place is still in ruins tells me they still haven't found her.
Byleth: We must find her.
Claude: True. I've got a mountain of questions I'd like to ask her, after all.
Byleth: I'm worried.
Claude: Worried, huh? Well, for better or worse, Rhea was clearly fond of you.
Claude: But I'm not so sure whether it would be good for her to return as the archbishop... Rather, with her gone... Eh, never mind. This could be a dangerous conversation. Before we discuss the state of affairs in each territory... Are you hungry? You must be. It's not much, but I did bring some food with me. Let's eat up and go from there.

@Intro 
Claude: Phew! I. Am. Stuffed. Even the most humble of meals tastes great with the right company. By the way, Teach, do you remember the night before the ball? I know it was five years ago... But we promised that the Golden Deer House would reunite during the millennium festival. Today's the day we promised to meet up... but no one's here.
Byleth: It's still early.
Claude: True... There's still some daylight left.
Byleth: They must not like us.
Claude: Heh, you know everyone looked up to you, right? Or is this your way of telling me I was a lousy house leader?
Claude: Let's just wait a little longer. You never know... Maybe someone will show up after all. Hey, Teach... Just waiting around sounds boring, so why don't we get in some exercise. You know, help with digestion and stuff. You must be in bad shape if you've been sleeping for five years. It'll do you good to get your body moving again.
Byleth: You want to work out?
Byleth: You want to play a game?
Claude: Something like that. Look, if you come with me, you'll understand. Oh, and don't forget your weapons, OK? I want to make sure neither your leadership nor your skill with a blade have dulled.

@Opening 
In the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, Imperialist loyalist Cornelia has subdued all regions of the former royal house of Blaiddyd to prevent further revolt. Prince Dimitri has been sentenced. Now, the backbone of the former KingdomâHouses Gautier and Fraldariusâstruggle to continue the resistance. Corneliaâoperating out of the royal palaceâhas accepted the support of the Empire to build an army and plots to wipe out all remaining Kingdom forces.

In the Leicester Alliance, House Riegan leads an anti-Imperial faction, while House Gloucester directs the Empireâs supporters. Despite the undeniable threat of fracture, the Allianceâs adept new leader, Claude, deftly maintains the outward appearance of a unified front.

In Enbarr, the Imperial Capital of the Adrestian Empire, Emperor Edelgard fights to strengthen her regime. She has extended her reach to the Kingdom by inciting a coup and continues to draw its former lords under her influence in pursuit of controlling all of western FÃ³dlan.

In the meantime, the Knights of Seiros have been dispatched to find Archbishop Rhea, who remains missing despite their searching. Left unattended, the monastery at Garreg Mach has fallen to ruin...and become a haven for thieves.

@Battle 
Claude: The thieves are here. Apparently they're trying to run off with treasures from the monastery.
PallardÃ³: What the... Intruders! Protect the goods!

Claude: This is gonna get expensive. Collect everything the thieves carried out!

Lorenz: The barbarity is even worse than the rumors. On my honor as a noble, I will expel these ruffians!
Ignatz: Today was supposed to be a happy day, but the monastery is in disrepair...
Hilda: Over there... Is that the professor? And the others?!
Leonie: Professor! You're alive! Guess we'd better handle this before I celebrate though, huh?
Claude: You finally made it! I guess virtue still exists in this crazy world after all.

Raphael: Is that the professor and everyone else? If they're fighting, I gotta go help!
Lysithea: Wow, it's you! Here I thought you were dead all this time.
Marianne: Could that be the Professor's...ghost?
Claude: Hey, you're late! Hurry up and help!

Claude: Hm, we could split into two groups. If we hit them from the north and south, we can trap their leader in a pincer attack.

@Battle-Talk 
%Byleth,Hilda
Hilda: Professor! Boy am I glad to see you. How did we end up in this situation?

%Byleth,Ignatz
Ignatz: Professor, it's been too long! I do want to chat, but first let's handle these criminals.

%Byleth,Leonie
Leonie: You've been alive all this time?! Where have you been hiding?! Never mind - talk later!

%Byleth,Lorenz
Lorenz: We have much to discuss. But first, let us dispense with the riffraff. It is a noble's duty, after all!

%Byleth,Lysithea
Lysithea: Ugh. The instant we arrive, we're neck deep in battle. We should've arrived late.

%Byleth,Marianne
Marianne: P-Professor? Is it really you?

%Byleth,Raphael
Raphael: Is that really you, Professor? It's been so long! I thought I'd never see you again!

@End 
Hilda: Ugh, I'm exhausted! What gives, Professor?
Lysithea: I was so excited to see everyone again, and then this happens...
Leonie: I'm still tired from the long journey. How did it come to this?
Ignatz: Let's all take a moment to catch our breath...
Hilda: If you've got the time to play with those guys, the least you could do is prepare some tea.
Byleth: Thanks for your help.
Claude: We were hoping someone would come to back us up when we started routing the bandits.
Byleth: Blame Claude.
Claude: Come on, those guys were thieves! We couldn't just let them get away.
Claude: It seems they've been taking advantage of the church's absence and doing whatever they please here.
Marianne: In any case, um... I'm glad that all of you are well.
Ignatz: That's the spirit, Marianne!
Raphael: That was fun! In fact, I wouldn't mind romping around some more!
Lorenz: So, you were alive this whole time, Professor. I am not surprised. In fact, that is why I came here.
Leonie: And it doesn't look like time has rusted your skills. That's a relief!
Claude: I'm just glad everyone's alive and well. On that note, let's move this reunion party somewhere else.



Claude: Now that we've dealt with those violent bandits, we could potentially use this place as our base of operations again.
Hilda: What could you possibly mean by that?
Claude: I'm talking about the Leicester Alliance taking over Garreg Mach Monastery. After all, it's right in the middle of FÃ³dlan. It's a critical strategic location.
Lysithea: Are you suggesting that we fight back against the Empire?
Lorenz: Aren't you getting a bit ahead of yourself? The Alliance is in complete discord at present.
Claude: And as leader of the Imperial faction of the Alliance, isn't Count Gloucester, your father, the main cause of that discord?
Lorenz: I... Yes, that is true. It was inevitable. Our house's territory is close to Imperial land, after all. Had we not consented to vassalage under the Empire, they would have invaded immediately.
Claude: Naturally. And to be clear, I have no problem with your house maintaining its Imperial ties until we're sufficiently prepared to revolt. The Empire is the cause of the infighting. If we rid ourselves of them, the situation should resolve itself. That's why I'm thinking we should make this our base, raise up an army, and stir up some trouble for the Empire.
Raphael: Now you're talking! Sounds like fun!
Hilda: So then, Mr. Leader Man. Does this mean you intend to rope us into your little scheme?
Byleth: Leader Man?
Claude: Hm? Ah. My grandfather passed away. That means yours truly is officially the leader of the Alliance.
Lorenz: If we had a more reliable leader, perhaps the Alliance would not have been divided...
Claude: Think what you will. All I need to know is if you're in or you're out.
Leonie: I'm happy to lend a hand. I won't let those Imperial dogs set foot in Alliance territory! I couldn't bear it if my village got caught up in the chaos of war.
Raphael: I'll fight too! I've gotta protect my little sis!
Lysithea: I will join as well. After all, House Ordelia was once dragged into an Imperial revolt. It ruined us.
Lorenz: Ah, of course. I understand your motivation.
Ignatz: I'll fight too... It's time to take responsibility for my own future!
Marianne: I... I don't want to run anymore. I hope I'll be of use to everyone...
Ignatz: We can do anything if we work together, Marianne!
Hilda: What about you, Lorenz? Are you going to go back home to your scary father or what?
Lorenz: We cannot rely on Claude's scheming to lead us to victory. Therefore, I will remain. It is my duty to ensure Claude does not worsen the situation in the Alliance.
Claude: All of us are fighting for a different reason, but we share a common enemy. If we don't act, the Empire will crush us eventually. I say we stop them before they have the chance! So, Teach... Will you help as well?
Byleth: I'd rather search for Rhea than fight.
Claude: All the more reason to join us. Admit it. You're not going to be able to do much on your own.
Byleth: I'll give it some thought.
Claude: Please do. I'm counting on you. Even if your ultimate goal is to find Rhea, it would be better to stick with us as you search.
Claude: With you on our side, the church will join us as well. That makes fighting the Empire a moral cause, which means it will be easier to rally support. Above all, your knowledge and strength are indispensable if we hope to stand a chance against the Imperial army. Without you, my schemes are nothing. Just words. Please... Take all of that into consideration as you decide.
Hilda: You're really laying it all on the table, aren't you, Claude? Well, all that aside, this place is a mess. We can't very well make our base in a ruin! And repairing it sounds like a lot of work... I wonder if anyone would be willing to help us out with that?

Seteth: Can it be?! You were alive all this time?!
Flayn: Professor! It is so good to see you again. My brother and I were worried about you.
Alois: Ah, thank the goddess... I couldn't bear the thought of letting Jeralt down by not finding you.
Shamir: Guess you lucked out.
Catherine: We've been looking everywhere for you! But...I see Lady Rhea isn't with you. Damn.
Cyril: Everyone was real worried about you, Professor.
Claude: Cyril? Is that you? You've grown up, kid. Have you been looking for Rhea with the knights?
Cyril: Of course. Without Lady Rhea, I don't belong anywhere.
Claude: Cyril, that's not... Never mind. We'll figure it all out.
Manuela: Oh my, the Golden Deer House is together again at last. And all grown up! Well, for the most part.
Hanneman: I do regret that we were never able to hold a proper graduation for all of you students.
Byleth: Why are you here?
Byleth: How is the search for Rhea progressing?
Seteth: It has been five years since Lady Rhea disappeared. We have devoted all of our energies to finding her. However, without being able to set foot in Empire territory, we are at a standstill. We had hoped that perhaps the archbishop would return here on this day...that of the long-awaited millennium festival.
Claude: Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case. Though, I don't suppose you had very high hopes in that regard. Even if she were able to return here, with the monastery in ruins, I don't think she would have felt safe enough to do so. Right, Hilda?
Hilda: Yeah. This is an important location for the church. To think you've left it in such a state!
Byleth: The believers are mourning this destruction.
Byleth: It's a danger to the locals too.
Alois: That's true... Perhaps we've left it alone for too long. We've got to make things right!
Cyril: I can clean this place up like new! It's not fit for Lady Rhea like this.
Catherine: And leaving this place in ruins affects the safety of this area too.
Hanneman: Agreed. There is also a great deal of valuable literature here.
Ignatz: Then let's do it! If we all work together, we can restore the monastery to its original beauty!
Seteth: We will require the aid of skilled craftsmen too. I shall seek out any such individuals who are willing to return to Garreg Mach.
Hilda: Fantastic! I'll figure out how to split up the work and then we can get started!
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
On the streets of the Imperial capital, Alliance forces crush Edelgard's army and take up the perimeter of the Imperial palace. The time has come to face Emperor Edelgard and to free Rhea from her clutches.

@Intro 
Claude: Is everyone ready? The objective of this battle is to defeat Edelgard and rescue Rhea. According to the information Dedue gave us, the throne room is directly north of the castle's main entrance. It's safe to assume that's where Edelgard is.
Byleth: I don't want to kill Edelgard.
Byleth: Is there no way to walk the same path as Edelgard?
Claude: She's a fellow student to all of us. If there's a path that we can walk together, that would be preferable. But that all depends on Edelgard. If she won't yield, then that's that. If showing pity would put my allies in danger, I will not hesitate to kill her. I ask that you and everyone here prepare yourselves to do the same.
Lysithea: Understood. I think I speak for everyone when I say that we are prepared.
Lorenz: The future of the Alliance â no, of FÃ³dlan â is at stake. I have been prepared for this my whole life.
Leonie: Captain Jeralt taught me that indecisiveness is a weakness. One must cast aside their doubts before fighting.
Flayn: The lives of Lady Rhea and everyone here are more important than all else. I shall be prepared.
Raphael: You know what? I wouldn't be surprised if she took one look at my overstuffed muscles and surrendered in tears, then and there!
Ignatz: I really hope that Edelgard will yield...
Hilda: Edelgard is a stubborn one. I don't think she's likely to surrender.
Marianne: Goddess... Please protect us...
Cyril: I...I'll fight with all I got to save Lady Rhea!
Seteth: Rescuing Lady Rhea is my dearest wish. We must prevail, no matter what it takes.
Alois: In the name of the Knights of Seiros, we'll bring the hammer down on the Imperial army!
Judith: Satisfied yet, boy? Everyone made up their minds a long time ago.
Claude: OK. Let's get started. We're yours to command, my friend.
Byleth: Leave it to me.
Claude: Everyone, take your positions! The battle is upon us!

@Battle 
Edelgard: They've made it into the palace, but it's actually the perfect chance to turn the tables on them. Defeating them all will turn the tide of war instantly. Taking a risk on dragging us back from the brink is the only option. Everyone! Prepare for a bitter struggle! Victory to the Adrestian Empire!
Claude: There are more enemies inside the palace than I thought. It's gonna take a lot to bring this situation under control. But, if we defeat Edelgard, then victory is ours! Everyone, let's go!

Claude: Our bashful little emperor has locked herself up behind the door of the throne room. The key should be around here somewhere. We need to find whoever's got it and take them out.

Petra: We must be protecting the throne room! You will not be getting past!
Dorothea: Stay back! I'll protect Edie with my life!
Claude: We'll have to take out one of them if we're going to advance... Petra seems like the shortest route...

Claude: I wonder how Dedue is doing... I hope I get to see him again.


Dedue: So close... Must press on...


Imperial Soldier: Infiltrators! Kill them!

Edelgard: I must confess I never imagined that you would be able to pursue me this far. I don't mean to belittle your skills, Professor, but you've far surpassed my expectations. Inform the troops! Destroy anyone who sets foot in the throne room!

Claude: We should be able to get through to the throne room now...

Claude: This should give us a bit more freedom of movement. Now, how best to attack...

Claude: We did it! The enemy won't be able to send any more reinforcements now.
Edelgard: Clever tactic. It's going to be difficult to turn the tables now.

Dedue: I cannot vanquish her alone. So I will join you in this battle. But if I fall, leave me. My only wish is for Edelgard's head.

@Boss 
Edelgard: So you're another of the goddess's vanguard. You don't have a shred of self-awareness, do you? Come at me, so that I may put you out of your misery!

Edelgard: Professor... I suppose you think you can defeat me. Is that right? But I will never give up. Even if my arms and legs failed me, I would still find a way to move forward. I will smash that false goddess and her minion into the ground! I will fight to free this world from her vile grasp!

Edelgard: This has nothing do to with where you were born. That we are fighting now is only a result of the choices you've made. So I'm going to give that the response it deserves. I will crush you with everything I have!

Claude: Edelgard, give up! We don't want to kill you!
Edelgard: But... I must kill you. If I don't, the righteous world I dream of will never see the light. Come at me with everything you have. For one of us, this is the end!

%Claude,Edelgard
Edelgard: Your ideals, I understand they're not so far removed from my own. But without sufficient knowledge of this land's suffering, I can't entrust FÃ³dlan to you!
Claude: Perhaps. I daresay it's true that I don't fully understand the history of FÃ³dlan. Still, I've seen many things in my life. Don't worry. I'll finish the job for you.

%Flayn,Edelgard
Flayn: Edelgard! Please! Release Rhea... Release FÃ³dlan!
Edelgard: If you strike me down, they will return. I cannot permit what you desire. You are a child of the goddess. You must not be allowed power over the people!

%Lysithea,Edelgard
Edelgard: Lysithea. You and I are so alike. We could have walked the same path.
Lysithea: We're alike? You don't mean to tell me... It can't be!
Edelgard: Yet now, we are at a crossroads. There's no turning back. Must we fight each other for the things we believe in?
Lysithea: That's exactly what's going to happen. And I will defeat you, Edelgard.

%Seteth,Edelgard
Seteth: Edelgard! Return Rhea! Release your grip on FÃ³dlan!
Edelgard: If you strike me down, they will return. I cannot permit what you desire. You are a child of the goddess. You must not be allowed power over the people!

@Cutscene 
Edelgard: It looks as though... my path... will end here.

Edelgard: My teacher... claim your victory.

Edelgard: Strike me down. You must!

Edelgard: Even now... across this land, people are killing each other. If you do not act now, this conflict... will go on forever.

Edelgard: Your path... lies across my grave. It is time for you to find the courage to walk it.

Edelgard: If I must fall... let it be by your hand.

Edelgard: I wanted... to walk with you...

@End 
Claude: It's over. We were only able to beat her because of you.
Byleth:  ...
Claude: This wasn't the conclusion I had hoped for. Even though... I... Never mind. It's over now. The important thing is that we won.


Judith: Here, boy. A letter. An Imperial general asked me to give it to you.
Claude: A letter? Let's see it.

Claude: It looks like it's from... Hubert. Edelgard's vassal.
Hubert: If you are reading this letter, that means I have perished. As Her Majesty would never surrender to another, I can only assume she has fallen as well. It greatly pains me to think of this coming to pass... That said, as the survivors, I must ask you to settle certain affairs in our stead. You must destroy the threat that slithers in the dark. I am sure you must recall Monica and Tomas. Their allies yet live. They hold deep resentment against the children of the goddess and the people of the world, and they are biding their time until they can exact revenge. If left to their own devices, it is certain they will eventually bring unimaginable calamity and suffering to the world. I detected their sorcery when you took Fort Merceus. I have deduced the location of their stronghold, Shambhala. You will find its whereabouts enclosed. There is no question that they are the enemies of everyone in FÃ³dlan. Do not allow yourselves to forget that. Lastly... While I cannot say she is in good health, the archbishop resides in a secret chamber in the Imperial palace. I have shared the location of the entrance to that secret chamber with the person to whom I have entrusted this letter. I believe that Her Majesty will be victorious... Even still, I must plan for her defeat as well. If you wish to lead this world, I challenge you to rise to the occasion and surpass my estimation of you. Such is your obligation as the victors... and the only fitting tribute to all that Lady Edelgard sacrificed.
Claude: Hubert... To leave a letter like this behind... You were a better man than I believed you to be. So, Rhea is alive. And the fight isn't over yet. Those who slither in the dark... It sounds like FÃ³dlan will never know peace unless we defeat them.

Claude: The allies of Monica and Tomas... Well, we knew about them already. I think it's safe to assume this is the same group who used Lysithea for their blood experiments. And they were also responsible for the javelins of light that destroyed the fortress. But who are these children of the goddess, who they supposedly resent? There's just not enough information here. I don't suppose there's any chance of his idea of a prank... If so, wow. Good one. Hubert... Rather than writing a letter, you should have just told us before we fought...
Byleth: Let's ask Rhea about it.
Claude: Right. We still don't know for sure if this letter is telling the truth. Let's go find out.

Rhea: You... You have come to save me... Is this... Is this a dream? I have longed to see you again... all this time... Is it truly you?

Rhea: Claude... I can see you have grown into a reliable young man... Thank you for supporting the professor, and for rescuing me. Surely the protection of the goddess has-
Claude: Wait, Rhea. What do you know about the children of the goddess?
Rhea: Children of... What is this about?
Claude: Forgive my bluntness. Someone from the Empire filled us in on a few things. I know it must be painful for us to ask you difficult questions after such an arduous confinement. But we have no choice. We must defeat a secret enemy... Those who slither in the dark. Do you know about them?
Rhea: Those who slither in the dark...
Claude: Apparently, they resent the children of the goddess and the people of the world, and are planning something big. Something terrible.
Rhea: ...
Claude: They use blood for their wicked magic and are capable of dropping javelins of light from the sky, which are powerful enough to crush a fortress. If you can think of anything at all, please tell us now. We need to know as much as possible about these enemies in order to stop them.
Rhea: ...
Claude: This is the critical moment that will determine whether or not FÃ³dlan falls! Can't you see that the time for secrets has passed?!
Rhea: It is true that there is a group of people who have slithered in the darkness and threatened the peace of FÃ³dlan since ancient times. I am sure you have heard the stories of a man named Nemesis...
Byleth: The King of Liberation...
Byleth: The wielder of the Sword of the Creator...
Claude: Nemesis, the King of Liberation. He's the hero to whom the goddess gave the Sword of the Creator.
Rhea: Nemesis was originally the leader of a group of bandits. He plundered the Holy Tomb and stole the remains of the progenitor god. When Nemesis appeared in Zanado some time later, he already wielded the Sword of the Creator.
Byleth: In Zanado?
Claude: Zanado, the Red Canyon...
Byleth: How did he get the Sword of the Creator?
Claude: According to legend, the goddess gifted him the sword to fight against the evil gods.
Rhea: I do not know how Nemesis obtained the sword, or why he appeared in Zanado. But he used that sword to massacre the people there. The children of the progenitor god. From their corpses he gained even more power, and brought war to FÃ³dlan...
Claude: That's completely different from what the legends tell us about Nemesis.
Rhea: A mere bandit like Nemesis would not have been capable of anything so monstrous on his own...
Claude: Aha! So Nemesis had accomplices. And those accomplices must have been those who slither in the dark. They used Nemesis! And this time they used the Imperial army to once again bring war to FÃ³dlan! I finally get it... And I even understand why Edelgard was associating with them. Just as they were trying to use the Empire, the Empire was trying to use them. Rhea, there's still a mountain of things I need to ask you. And I will. But I'll leave all of that for another day. You must be weak after living in confinement for so long. Please rest for a while. My friend... Let's prepare for battle. We need to strike Shambhala as soon as possible.
Rhea: You must not allow FÃ³dlan's bloody history... the Red Canyon Tragedy... to repeat itself...

@Dialogue 
Claude: Hm. It occurred to me that we never got an answer from Rhea about the children of the goddess.
Byleth: Aren't they the people of Zanado?
Claude: She did say that the people of the Red Canyon were the children of the progenitor god, so I suppose so. But those evil guys continue to plot their revenge even after the Red Canyon Tragedy. Does that mean some of the children of the goddess, or their descendants, are still alive?
Byleth: Rhea?
Claude: Could be. She was talking about what happened in Zanado as if she was there herself.
Byleth: Flayn?
Claude: If there's something special about her blood, we can't rule out the possibility.
Byleth: Me?
Claude: Huh. Maybe? Though I get the feeling you're something else altogether.
Claude: What are these children anyway? And how are they connected to the goddess? Bah! I almost disappeared into the bottomless swamp that is my mind. I thought that after we defeated the Empire, I'd be able to see that sight I long to see..
Byleth: What sight is that?
Claude: I've told you about my dreams before... I want to break down the wall separating FÃ³dlan from the outside world. The sight I want to see lies beyond that. Honestly, it's a trivial thing to fixate on. Just people, gathered in their towns. Living our their lives together. Sometimes laughing. Sometimes fighting. But the people living there aren't just citizens of FÃ³dlan. They are people from Dagda, Brigid, and even Duscur and Sreng. There could be people who were born in Almyra or countries even farther east there too.. All of those people living together, like it's nothing special at all. That's the sight I long to see. It's so simple, but still so far away... But this is no time for complaining. We need to focus on capturing Shambhala. Let's hurry up and gather everyone together.

Judith: So... you mean to tell me that FÃ³dlan will fall to ruin if we leave those guys be?
Hilda: Um, if this map is reliable, their base is just south of my family's territory.
Lorenz: This story is a bit much to believe... And yet...
Leonie: It does ring true somehow.
Claude: Remember Monica, the one who killed Jeralt? And the old man who was masquerading as Tomas? They were their allies. And the Flame Emperor and the Death Knight were merely their pawns.
Flayn: The people who were after my blood?!
Lysithea: They were also the ones who used me to conduct their blood experiments...
Claude: As awful as it sounds, they're seemingly fond of using blood in their secret techniques.
Hilda: Eww! That's really gross! I could never be friends with someone like that.
Claude: I believe they were also responsible for the javelin of light that destroyed Fort Merceus.
Judith: Hold up, boy. Do you really think that we can win against such powerful foes?
Claude: I don't know. But we have to try, don't we?
Byleth: This is for FÃ³dlan's future.
Hilda: We've really taken on something big. I wonder if our names will go down in history.
Lorenz: My heroic name? Passed down to future generations? Haha! A worthy cause indeed.
Byleth: It's our responsibility as the victors.
Hilda: Since Edelgard can't do it, I guess it falls to us.
Claude: They were trying to use the Imperial army to plunge FÃ³dlan into war, but we nipped that in the bud. Now we just need to tear our their roots. And I know we have what it takes to do it.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Claude leverages his victory at the Battle of Gronder to secure reinforcements from Alliance lords. Meanwhile, the Imperial army continues to tighten its defenses at Fort Merceus in anticipation of an attack on the Imperial capital.

@Dialogue 
Judith: Our objective is Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. But our greatest obstacle lies before that.
Ignatz: And what's what?
Judith: Fort Merceus. If we can't pass through, we won't be able to reach Enbarr.
Leonie: Fort Merceus... the Impregnable Fortress, or so it's called.
Ignatz: If I recall correctly, it's sometimes referred to as the Stubborn Old General.
Lysithea: It is a massive fortress that was constructed to protect the Imperial capital.
Shamir: The Imperial army we defeated has withdrawn to Enbarr. Fort Merceus should be short on soldiers for now.
Byleth: We should attack quickly.
Judith: Yes, it would be good to finish up here before more enemy reinforcements arrive.
Byleth: We should be careful.
Judith: It would be best to take it before enemy reinforcements arrive. Still, there's a reason it's been called impregnable.
Judith: The only real question is what our fearless leader intends to do...

Claude: Sorry for the delay, everyone. Those mewling lords kept me from leaving for quite some time.
Judith: So? Were you able to secure additional reinforcements?
Claude: It's gonna have to wait until next month. It doesn't look like they can afford to keep supporting us at present.
Judith: Then what should we do about Fort Merceus? Do you plan on waiting around?
Claude: No. If we wait until next month, the enemy will have bolstered their defenses. That said, the prevailing theory is that you need triple your enemies' forces to take a fortress with a frontal assault.
Leonie: Right, that's what we were taught at the academy. And this is Fort Merceus we're talking about. It's renowned for its strong defenses.
Claude: Our current army isn't nearly strong enough. Hmm... What to do...
Judith: Whatever you do, just don't ask us to scale those huge walls. We'd end up dead when they hurl rocks down at us.
Hilda: Yeah, no thanks! If only someone would open up the gates for us from the inside.
Claude: Unfortunately we don't have any spies in there. Wait a minute... I've got it! We sneak in, stir up confusion, and open the gates ourselves to let our allies in.
Hilda: Right! That's what I was saying all along!
Ignatz: Right. Nice one, Hilda. But how do you propose we go about sneaking in?
Hilda: Disguises? If we dress up like Imperial soldiers, maybe they'll think we're allies and let us in!
Leonie: Do you really think they'd just open the gates for us? I'd be pretty dumbfounded if that worked.
Claude: No, no - she's on to something. It's a good idea, Hilda. We just need to refine it a bit, and we'll be in there before we know it.
Hilda: Really? Go me!
Lorenz: What is your definition of refining the idea? I know your go-to strategy is nausea-inducing poison, but...
Raphael: Urgh! I maybe ate too much. My stomach hurts...
Lorenz: Raphael... Why are you eating meat during a war council?!
Judith: So, fearless leader, I'm guessing you're going to keep the crucial parts of your scheme under wraps until the time comes, aren't you?
Claude: You know me so well, Judith. Whether we like it or not, this war puts a damper on all of our spirits. What's wrong with trying to have a little fun every now and again? Just leave the details to me.

@Conversation 
Claude: Each time we take a step forward, more blood is spilled... but by spilling that blood, we're able to take yet another step forward. War is always a cruel affair, but luckily we have each other to lean on. We've steeled our hearts. We won't be broken.
Byleth: I'm glad we have such reliable allies. 
Claude: I couldn't agree more. Without them, we could never have made it this far.
Byleth: I wonder if we're pushing them too hard.
Claude: If anyone's starting to feel the strain, I'm sure just hearing from you will reassure them. Please... do whatever you can to keep their morale up.
Claude: Oh, and about taking the fort... I'll need a tad more time to prepare our plan. It's called an impregnable fortress for a reason, after all. My contingencies need contingencies this time, or we might not pull it off.



Lorenz: Fort Merceus is old and strong. Its reputation for durability is equal to that of Arianrhod. Are we really going to leave this to Claude? With a plan concocted by Hilda, of all people?
Byleth: I'm uneasy too. 
Lorenz: I thought you might be, with how secretly that man devises his schemes.
Byleth: Have a little faith.
Lorenz: I would like to, but I am always troubled by how secretly that man devises his schemes.
Lorenz: Let us hope the end result is not too outlandish.



Raphael: You know when you work your muscles and they start screaming? That means you gotta be nice to them. If your muscles are hungry, you gotta feed them, and let them rest when they're tired.
Byleth: I don't see how you'd do that.
Raphael: Whaddya mean, how? You just gotta eat and sleep! It's pretty obvious...
Byleth: You can tell how your muscles are feeling? 
Raphael: Of course! If my muscles hurt, then I hurt. If they're hungry, well then I'm hungry too!
Raphael: What's with the confused face, Professor? You look like you don't get a word I'm saying!



Ignatz: The battle at Gronder Field was gruesome, wasn't it? But perhaps it's irresponsible to look away - to close our eyes to the horrors of war.
Byleth: I agree.
Ignatz: As survivors, we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain. We must see the tragic foundations upon which we'll build our future.
Byleth: You don't have to force yourself. 
Ignatz: Thank you. But I think I do actually. As survivors, we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain. We must see the tragic foundations upon which we'll build our future.
Ignatz: May an age of peace rise from the ashes, so that all this sacrifice means something.



Lysithea: As I suspected, they seem to be supporting the Imperial army now. Thought I don't quite know who they are yet... Nor do I know what tricks they'll use against us next. We can't afford to let our guard down...



Marianne: I never used to care whether I lived or died... But after seeing so much death firsthand, I now realize how precious life truly is. I'm ashamed of how arrogant I was to think that death could mean so little...



Hilda: I wonder how far we can get with this plan. Dressing up like Imperial soldiers to sneak in. Claude said it could use some refinement. Any ideas?
Byleth: We could dress you as the emperor. 
Hilda: Dress me as Edelgard?! But we look nothing alike!
Byleth: We could dress Claude as a woman.
Hilda: Claude, dressed as a woman? I don't understand what the point of that would be.
Hilda: On second thought, let's just stick to the plan as originally conceived. That seems safer.



Leonie: Claude takes care of the strategy, you direct the troops, and the rest of us focus on the fighting. As long as the system keeps working, we can win any battle, no matter the odds. That's what everyone's saying anyway. Hope you can keep up with our expectations, Professor.



Ferdinand: Dimitri, the late Prince of Faerghus. He despised the Empire with all his heart. He should not have tried leading an army while his emotions were holding him captive.
Byleth: Leaders are people too.
Byleth: Leaders can't be emotional? 
Ferdinand: No. If a leader's emotions overcome them, others must step in to prevent poor decision-making. Why did his followers not intervene? His attendants? I used to call Edelgard my leader, and now she is running amok. I am duty-bound to stop her.



Linhardt: There's word that Claude has developed a rather interesting stratagem to capture the fortress. You know Fort Merceus's nickname, I assume. The Stubborn Old General? But there must be one or two gaps in its defenses...



Caspar: Fort Merceus is next, huh? Ah, the memories. It's a huge stronghold in my father's domain. The town's completely surrounded by high walls. I used to run around there when I was a kid... Way back when a fortress was just a playground for me. Yeah, those were the days.


Bernadetta: It's always relaxing coming back here. But it's hard to relax knowing we have to go out on another expedition again so soon. And assaulting that huge keep? That sounds hard. Oh, really hard! Don't you think it'll be hard?!
Byleth: It's going to be tough. 
Bernadetta: I knew you'd think so! I knew you-- Ow! Oh, ow. Can't believe I tried to hug you through the door.
Byleth: We'll be fine.
Bernadetta: Of course you'd say that. Why did I even bother asking?



Dorothea: So many people died in the battle at Gronder... And here we are, preparing for the next battle, as if nothing happened the day before. It's almost easier to think of war as theater, with the stage an entire continent.
Byleth: Though the actors die, the show goes on? 
Dorothea: Something like that. If an accident happens on stage, the next day's performance must unaffected.
Byleth: It really doesn't seem like theater.
Dorothea: Even if an accident happens on stage, the next day you have to sing as though nothing happened.
Dorothea: Everyone just pretends like everything is fine... focusing on their role in the play.



Petra: I have excitement in my heart for secret tactics! I enjoy attacks that are surprising.
Byleth: Why's that?
Byleth: Because it's like hunting? 
Petra: Yes. Hunting is doing surprise attacks on prey.
Petra: Surprise attacks are safe with friends. Fewer injuries.



Felix: My relationship with the boar prince began even before I was born. He was always by my side. You might even say that, at one time, we were best friends.
Byleth: What do you mean, best friends?
Byleth: What happened?
Felix: I couldn't fathom the depth of his hatred for the Empire. So much anguish. Could I have saved him? Could I have stopped him?



Ashe: I've heard Dedue's passed on. Just like His Highness.
Byleth: We can't know that for certain.
Ashe: That's true. I did hear that his body was never found.
Byleth: Don't believe everything you hear. 
Ashe: You're right. I don't think anyone's found his body, so I guess he might still be out there.
Byleth: Dedue is dead?
Ashe: That's what I've heard, but no one's found his body.
Ashe: If, somehow, he's still alive...I hope we'll meet again.



Sylvain: Ya know, Professor, laying siege to a keep is like asking a girl out on a date. First, you get past her defenses...then you make your move.
Byleth: That's not the best analogy.
Sylvain: Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. I'm a seasoned veteran at this kind of thing. Girls, I mean. I've never actually, you know, captured any keeps...
Byleth: You might be right. 
Sylvain: Ha! I knew you'd get it, Professor.
Sylvain: Anyway, you know more about tactics than me, so I don't know why I'm offering you advice.



Mercedes: Oh, Goddess, hear my prayer. Please bless the deceased with peace everlasting...And may his soul rest in tranquility. You know, I used to see him praying quite often when I would come to the cathedral at night. I wonder who it was he prayed for back then...



Annette: After the battle at Gronder, some people claim they saw my father. They said he walked off the battlefield clutching... His Highness's dead body... So long as Father's alive, I don't need anything else. I just... I hope to see him again one day...



Ingrid: Among our prisoners of war, there were quite a few people who served His Highness. One of them stated that the Empire was involved with the Tragedy of Duscur. If this is true, His Highness's motives seem clear. I can't help but feel that perhaps I should have fought by his side...
Byleth: Why is that?
Ingrid: Because...I, too, lost someone to that tragedyâthe most important person in my world.
Byleth: Are you having regrets? 
Ingrid: No. Not anymore. I am where I belong.
Ingrid: Those of us still on this plane of existence will carry the torch. The inhumane actions of the Empire must not be repeated.



Seteth: Fort Merceus is a keep that was constructed to defend the Imperial Capital, Enbarr. We cannot enter the capital without first capturing that fort. But once we have it, the city should be almost entirely at our mercy. Whatever strategy you have in mind, I have faith that it will lead to victory.



Flayn: Standing face to face with those whom I went to school with. On the field of battle... How inhuman war is - how horrifying. My heart feels shattered. It is my hope that this war marks the end of such foolish behavior.



Hanneman: Fort Merceus is the Empire's single most fortified military installation. Utterly impregnable, they say. I wonder, do you happen to know the nickname given to Fort Merceus?
Byleth: The Silver Maiden.
Hanneman: No, I'm afraid that name refers to the Fortress City of Arianrhod.
Byleth: FÃ³dlan's Locket.
Hanneman: That one is a fortress that stands at FÃ³dlan's Throat.
Byleth: The Stubborn Old General. 
Hanneman: Indeed! A very good answer, but of course you'd know that.
Hanneman: Seems FÃ³dlans give everyone and everything a nickname. Why, you were called the Ashen Demon! Myself, I have been called the Father of Crestology, which is a nickname as well as a title, I suppose...



Manuela: Each step closer to Enbarr, I'm reminded of another part of my past. Riches and poverty, glory and failure, that city has it all! And if I'm honest... sometimes I miss it. That's how the past works though, isn't it? It's always a different story than what you really lived.



Alois: Hilda's quite a tactician! Disguising ourselves as enemy soldiers to sneak in, undetected. A stroke of brilliance. With this strategy, we can really snatch victory from the jaws of...deceit!
Byleth: That's a good point.
Alois: Yes... With you leading our fighters, I've no doubt the Empire will suffer an embarrassing deceit. Get it? Deceit? Again?
Byleth: That's a bad pun. 
Alois: Ah, rats! You've seen through my cunning punning!



Catherine: I hardly recognize everyone... Their faces have changed so much. More experience in the eyes, and more pain. I'm glad that they're stronger, but I hate to think that they've all become hardened killers. Look after them, OK? Try to keep 'em on the straight-and-narrow.



Shamir: Please tell Claude not to give us any more ridiculous orders. I've reached out through all of my channels, but there are limits to these things. I'll have to recruit an entire town's worth of people if I ever plan on making enough Imperial uniforms.



Cyril: Guess what I noticed. I can see further than most other people can see. But I can't figure the point of seeing further than an arrow can fly, since I can't shoot what I see.
Byleth: You could detect enemy movements in advance.
Cyril: I suppose I could see a whole horde of enemies coming and run away. That's kinda useful, at least.
Byleth: You could find our targets quicker than anyone. 
Cyril: Yeah, I suppose it could be real useful for finding Lady Rhea too.
Cyril: Thanks, Professor. I think I get it now. I'm gonna put my eyes to real good use.



Judith: Ah, Professor. I have a question for you... Have you heard of the Death Knight? I'm referring to that Imperial general who has been operating under that moniker.
Byleth: I've heard of him.
Judith: Nothing is certain yet, but I get the feeling we'll have to face him soon enough.
Byleth: I haven't heard of him.
Judith: Well now... I don't know very much myself. Only that he's caused a great deal of havoc in the west. Nothing is certain yet, but I get the feeling we'll have to face him soon enough.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Is it true that we'll be assaulting Fort Merceus next? That doesn't sound like the brightest idea... I've heard that it's built to withstand an attack from even the largest of armies! Not to tell you how to do your job, but don't do it! I'm not ready to say my final good-byes to everyone...

@Intro 
Ignatz: I delivered our letter to Fort Merceus. I don't think they suspected anything.
Claude: I knew I was right to entrust that task to you. You've got that honest kind of face that makes it easy to fool people.
Ignatz: Is that meant to be a compliment?
Lysithea: What did you write in the letter?
Claude: I informed them that reinforcements were on the way. It would have been suspicious for troops to show up unannounced.
Hilda: So, the plan is...
Claude: We'll disguise ourselves as reinforcements from the Imperial capital and sneak in to Fort Merceus.
Hilda: Oh! You used my disguise plan after all!
Claude: We've also procured Imperial army uniforms.
Hilda: Ooh, good work. I knew this was the only way!
Claude: However... That alone wouldn't be enough.
Hilda: You did say the plan needed a little more refinement. Are you going to dress up like Edelgard, Claude?
Claude: I'm not sure that would accomplish much. In the letter, I included the name of the Imperial general leading the reinforcements. While we're heading to the fort, a separate army is going to attack us.
Marianne: We're going to be attacked?!
Claude: That's all just for show, though. It'll be our allies who are attacking us.
Hilda: Oh, I get it! We're going to make it look like the Alliance is attacking Imperial reinforcements!
Claude: Right. When the troops in the fortress panic and open up the gates... We're in.
Judith: I'd love nothing more than for this plan to work, but I've got some bad news for you. Apparently the notorious Death Knight has been placed in charge of defending Fort Merceus.

Marianne: The one who kidnapped Flayn...

Flayn: The Death Knight... I did not wish to ever think of him again.
Judith: He got some acclaim in the battle to subjugate western Faerghus. They say he holds the most military prowess in the Empire.
Claude: Even so, we've got Teach here to command us. All will be well. You have to trust us.
Judith: So your big plan is to just trust your professor? Really, boy?
Leonie: Under the professor's guidance, I'm sure we'll manage somehow. We're counting on the tactics you learned from Captain Jeralt!
Claude: Prepare yourselves, everyone. It's time.

Claude: Teach... This is for your ears only, but there's actually one more part to my plan. I had hoped it wouldn't come to this, but I have no choice.
Byleth: No choice?
Claude: Absolutely. We can't afford to hold anything back. Thanks to Edelgard's strength, the Imperial army is more unified than I would have expected. It was a painful realization, but after our battle at Gronder Field, it's clear that we can't win if we don't pull out all the stops. I also realized something else during that battle. There really is something special about you, Teach. The reason we were all able to keep our cool in the midst of the chaos was because we all trust in you. In your command and in your strength. Everyone here believes that we will win as long as we have you on our side. Our faith in you is borderline religious. You and I... We have what it takes to free FÃ³dlan from the Empire's rule. I know in my heart that we'll make it through to witness the world after all the fighting has ceased.



Death Knight: That man/woman approaches...
Caspar: Who are you talking about? You don't mean that professor, do you?! Doesn't matter. No one could take this fortress.
Linhardt: Ugh, sounds like a bother... I'll be taking a nap about now.

Death Knight: Will death's scythe claim you... Or will I fall to that sword of yours...

@Opening 
While waiting for reinforcements, the Alliance predicts the Empire will continue to fortify its defenses at Fort Merceus. Knowing this risk, Claude an a select few advance, hoping to gain entry to the fort through deception.

Fort Merceus, said to be impregnable, lies between you and Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Seizing the sturdy fortress will require a carefully devised strategy.

@Battle 
Imperial Soldier: General, reinforcements have arrived from the capital. They clashed with Alliance forces in the outskirts of the city, but should enter the fortress soon.
Death Knight: You let them in? Make haste and slaughter them all.
Imperial Soldier: Huh? Why?
Death Knight: They are enemies. Slaughter them all. I will not say it again.

Claude: We made it in. Professor, take control from the south. I have my own task to do from here. There are preparations to be made for our secret plan.

@Cutscene 
Nader: I see your skills haven't dulled yet, kiddo.
Claude: What did you expect?

Claude: Everyone, listen up! From now on, the Almyran forces will be fighting by our side!

Claude: We'll work as one! And we will bring down that fort together!

@Battle 
Claude: An impregnable fortress is a wide-open prairie once you get inside. From here, we'll attack from the north and south at once!
Nader: No different than a prairie, you say? Heh! You've got a strange head on your shoulders, kiddo
Claude: For Nader the Undefeated, this should be as easy as a walk in a meadow, right?
Nader: Heh. Well, goddess or death god or whoever they may be, let's crush them to dust.

Death Knight: The time of ruin draws near... But their slaughter must wait until next we meet...
Alliance Soldier: Report! The Death Knight has escaped the fortress!
Claude: He gave up too easily. Does he have some other plan? Let's deal with the remaining enemies and go after him, quickly!

Death Knight: The time is ripe.

Alliance Soldier: Report! The Death Knight is moving! It looks like they're abandoning the fortress and making an escape!
Claude: We need to put an end to this here and now. Come on, let's circle around and cut off his retreat.

@Boss 
%Claude,Death Knight
Claude: Hey, how long's it been? Five years? Who'd have thought you'd end up an Imperial general...
Death Knight: So, you wish to die.
Claude: Heh. As antisocial and unhinged as ever, I see.

@End 
Nader: Hey, kiddo! What was with that... javelin of... light?
Claude: Javelin of light... That describes it pretty well. The fortress was supposedly impregnable, but look at it now.It's hard to imagine that the Empire would do something like that. But if not them, then who? And for what purpose? If they wanted to kill us, then why wait until now to use it?
Judith: We almost died just now... and without an answer to any of that. Speaking of unanswered questions, why is Nardel here? Care to explain? I get the feeling there's something you two are keeping from us.
Nader: I'll go ahead and see my subordinates off to Almyra, kiddo.
Claude: Wait, Nader! Are really going to just leave me here and run away?
Nader: I hope to see you again, Judith. And you too, Professor. I'll be praying for your safety!

Judith: Nader? Are you saying that Nardel is actually Nader the Unstoppable?!
Byleth: Unstoppable?
Claude: It's actually Nader the Undefeated. Almyrans love grand titles.
Judith: I knew he was no ordinary person, but to think he was the great hero of Almyra...
Hilda: Hey, um, can we really afford to be chatting right now? If another one of those javelins of light falls, we're all dead!
Lorenz: Claude. There are things I wish to ask you, but first we must hurry and withdraw.
Claude: Right you are. Come on, everyone! Let's hurry up and get out of here.

Lorenz: Claude. It is time for you to explain. Why are you so close with an Almyran general?
Claude: Well, he did quite a bit for me when I was younger.
Lorenz: When you were younger... So, before you joined House Riegan. How and where did you meet him? There aren't many opportunities to meet a general from Almyra in FÃ³dlan...
Claude: If that's what you believe, it's only because that's what you've been led to believe. After all, we have Cyril here among our allies, and he was born in Almyra.
Cyril: Hey, now. Don't drag me into this.
Claude: There's a big, wide world outside of FÃ³dlan, and it's overflowing with different places and cultures. You think interacting with outsiders is odd, but isn't avoiding contact with the outside world far more unnatural?
Lorenz: Don't change the subject, Claude. To the people of the Alliance, the Almyrans are-
Claude: It's true that there's a history of hostility, but why should that mean we're doomed to remain hostile forever? The Almyrans aren't monsters. Just look at Cyril! Does he look like a monster to you?
Cyril: Hey, what's that supposed to mean?
Claude: Right, Teach? What did you think when you met Nader?
Byleth: He's... interesting.
Byleth: He's a reliable general.
Claude: Ha! I'll tell him you said that. And I'm sure that if all of you got to know him, all of your preconceived notions would change too. I know you guys, and you aren't the type of people to reject someone without trying to get to know them.
Hilda: But... how did those Almyrans even get past FÃ³dlan's Throat? I doubt my brother would just let them pass without saying anything...
Claude: About that... I actually made sure your brother met Nader in advance.
Lorenz: What?! Lord Holst met with an Almyran general?
Hilda: Oh, so that's why you were so interested in my brother. But wait, they're supposed to be bitter enemies! They've fought each other several times before!
Claude: I know. It was a big gamble. But rather than having me try to convince them myself, I knew it would be easier to just have them meet. They were taken aback at first, but sure enough, they hit it off. They were even drinking to their newfound brotherhood before parting.
Judith: It makes sense. If you take the greatest heroes away from the battlefield, of course they'll get along.
Hilda: Fighting one minute and drinking together the next... Men are so weird!
Claude: Ultimately, someone's bloodline has nothing to do with the friendships they forge. Relations between the Alliance and Almyra is a matter we'll tackle in the future. Still, I want to take this opportunity to make one thing clear to all of you. After we defeat the Empire, I intend to tear down the walls that separate FÃ³dlan from the outside world. I want to let people and goods come and go freely, and in doing so, eradicate prejudices about the outside world.
Cyril: Huh?!
Lorenz: Would it even be possible to achieve such a thing? It directly contradicts the Seiros tenets.
Claude: Does it? I'm not so sure. I'm any case, I'm prepared for the inevitable protests and criticism. New ways of doing things are always met with resistance. During our time at the Officer's Academy, all of you overcame the barriers of birthplace, status, and ideology. Having gone through so much with all of you, I have no doubt that, in time, you'll understand.
Hilda: I guess there were a lot of different people there. People we wouldn't have met through the normal course of our lives.
Claude: Duscur once opposed the Kingdom, but there was someone from Duscur there. Brigid once invaded the Empire, but the Brigid princess was there. We ate at the same table as those people. Sure, sometimes we didn't get along. But other times, we helped each other out. Can we really draw a definitive line in the sand and say one group of people is all good, and another all bad? If I can realize my dream, FÃ³dlan will be reborn. The old age will end and we'll welcome a new dawn.
Lorenz: But, if-
Judith: Save your objections for another day, Gloucester boy.
Lorenz: Ugh...
Judith: That said, there are more pressing matters to discuss. Our next step is to invade the Imperial capital, right?
Claude: That's right. I'm sure Edelgard is eagerly awaiting our arrival in Enbarr. Reinforcements from the Alliance lords should arrive soon. Let's make sure we're ready to greet them.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
With the destruction of Shambhala, the ambitions of those who slither in the dark are forever shattered. However, Rhea has suffered grievous injuries in the aftermath. Yet certain mysteries remain unsolved, so Claude and the others approach Rhea, who is now confined to her room due to her wounds.

@Dialogue 
Rhea: I am happy to see you two...
Claude: Sorry to interrupt your rest. But there are some things that we absolutely must ask you.
Rhea: It seems I do not have much time left. I do not intend to hide anything any longer.
Byleth: ...
Claude: Rhea... I have to ask. You're the Immaculate One, aren't you? If what I'm thinking is correct, that's what the children of the goddess is referring to. In other words, youâ
Rhea: I am the last child of the progenitor god. A long time ago, the progenitor god came from somewhere far away and descended upon this continent. She changed her form to resemble that of a human, and gave her own blood to birth her children. The progenitor god and her children shared knowledge and skills with the people of the land. Together, they built a prosperous civilization. But the humans turned their backs on the teachings of the progenitor god and engaged in senseless wars. Eventually people began to think of themselves as gods and challenged the progenitor god herself to battle. The land was scorched in the war that ensured and the majority of humans were annihilated. I believe that those who slither in the dark are the descendants of those who retreated beneath the ground during that time.
Claude: So they had been waiting all that time for their chance at revenge...
Rhea: It took the progenitor god an astonishing amount of time to revive the ravaged world. But eventually, the continent found peace again, and the progenitor god, having fulfilled her duty, fell into a long slumber in the Holy Tomb. The children who stayed behind built a settlement in Zanado to protect the Holy Tomb as they quietly lived out their lives. But then...Nemesis appeared, bringing tragedy along with him. Even now I cannot forget the sight...of that massive canyon, painted red with blood... I was never able to forgive those who proudly wielded weapons crafted from the corpses of my brethren. I was the only survivor of Zanado, and all I could do was wander across FÃ³dlan clinging to my desperate desire for revenge. I called myself Seiros, fostered the founding of the Empire, and prepared to oppose Nemesis and his followers.
Claude: Unbelievable...
Rhea: I put Zanado behind me to gather the remaining children who were scattered across FÃ³dlan... Finally, we killed Nemesis on the Tailtean Plains, and I took back the Sword of the Creator.
Claude: Let me get this straight... Saint Seiros...is you?! You're kidding me, right?

Knight of Seiros: Professor. Claude. There's something you need to hear right away...
Rhea: If you have something to report, do so at once. There is no need to let my presence worry you.
Knight of Seiros: As you wish... We're receiving a constant stream of express messengers from cities to the east. They claim that an unidentified military force is attacking and that there have already been a large number of casualties.
Claude: What?!
Knight of Seiros: The reports indicate that the cities and towns along the East Gronder Thoroughfare in the old Hrym territory have already been destroyed. Some villages were razed completely, leaving no survivors...
Claude: Damn it! Did they come from Shambhala? Could it be that there were some remnants of that wicked group hiding there?
Rhea: ...

Knight of Seiros: I have a report! The unidentified military force has crossed the Great Bridge of Myrddin! Alliance forces met them in battle, but it seems they have already broken through!
Claude: They've already made it so far. Is Count Gloucester unharmed?
Hilda: The count is fine, but apparently my brother joined with reinforcements and was gravely injured...
Claude: You mean to tell me they easily got past a general as skilled as Holst?
Hilda: They say the enemy general has a weapon that resembles the Sword of the Creator. Even my brother was powerless to stop him...
Byleth: The Sword of the Creator?
Claude: That's not possible...
Knight of Seiros: The enemy forces are flying a banner bearing the Crest of Flames as they continue their march west along the Airmid River.
Rhea: ...
Knight of Seiros: We believe they're marching toward Garreg Mach. We are preparing to meet them in battle.

Rhea: A weapon that resembles the Sword of the Creator... and banner bearing the Crest of Flames... There is only one explanation. The one leading the enemy force...is Nemesis himself.
Claude: Nemesis? That Nemesis? Do you really think the ancient King of Liberation has been brought back to life?
Rhea: Perhaps the seal was broken when Shambhala fell... An incredible power that we children cannot hope to match dwells within the blood of the progenitor god. Nemesis obtained that blood, so it would not surprise me if that were the case.
Claude: The blood of the progenitor god... That's right, he did take the remains from the Holy Tomb, didn't he...
Rhea: From the blood of the progenitor god, Sothis, he acquired the Crest of Flames. From her bones and heart, he crafted the Sword of the Creator.
Claude: The Sword of the Creator is made from her bones and heart?
Rhea: The heart of Sothis is the Crest Stone that was placed in the Sword of the Creator. The same is true of the Crests of the 10 Elites and the other Crest Stones... They were born of the blood and hearts of the progenitor god's children. Those who slither in the dark created them. Stole them. Sothis never gifted that power to the humans.
Claude: The Crests of the 10 Elites, the Crest Stones, and the Heroes' Relics... I can't believe those who slither in the dark made them all. And after that, Nemesis used the Sword of the Creator to massacre all of the progenitor god's children in Zanado... In other words, the citizens of Zanado were killed by weapons made from the remains of their brethren... How atrocious. But I don't get it... The Sword of the Creator that Teach wields doesn't have a Crest Stone. So how is Teach able to wield its full power?
Rhea: The Crest Stone of the progenitor god...dwells within your professor.
Claude: ... 
Rhea: After I battled with Nemesis as Saint Seiros, I reclaimed the heart of Sothis. I wanted to use that heart to...resurrect her. Even though I had to do some...questionable things to achieve that goal, I wished to see Sothis...my mother...once more.
Byleth: You placed her heart in me?
Rhea: Yes. I believed that if I could resurrect my mother, I could regain all that had been lost...
Claude: So...that's the truth of it.
Rhea: I suspected that your body housed the consciousness of Sothis. Those suspicions were correct. And yet, she merely gave you her power and vanished... My dearest wish did not come true... But you did inherit the power of the progenitor god. Now, you must use that power to defeat Nemesis once and for all. FÃ³dlan's blood-stained history...must end.

@Conversation 
Claude: Huh... What a magnificent tale! It's enough to make your head spin. Rhea's real identity is Saint Seiros, and the one who attacked us was Nemesis, the King of Liberation! On top of that, you've got the heart of the goddess in you! My flabber is completely gasted right now. But now isn't the time for standing around in disbelief. Nemesis has made it this far for a reason. If we aren't victorious, that's it for FÃ³dlan's new dawn. The world will forever be shrouded in darkness... This is the final, FINAL battle. Finally. My friend... Please give it your all out there!



Lorenz: A sudden invasion from Nemesis has plunged the Alliance territories into complete disarray. Against such overwhelming strength, my father and his forces had no choice but to retreat.
Byleth: Wise decision. 
Byleth: I'm glad he's survived.
Lorenz: It was certainly prudent for him to avoid a fruitless death. But as things stand, he will not leave much of an impression on history. So that falls to me. I will do all that I canâfor the future of FÃ³dlan, and the glory of House Gloucester!



Raphael: Hey, Professor! Have you heard from Claude? He says he's gonna throw a feast if we win the next battle! Enough food to clean out the stores!
Byleth: That sounds great! 
Byleth: So what?
Raphael: So I'm super motivated to win! I'm gonna train every muscle I got! I'm coming for you, Nemesis! I'm coming for you, feast!



Ignatz: I got the gist of it from Claude. Those who slither in the dark... They seem to be descended from humans who were forced deep underground after the goddess defeated them.
Byleth: That's what I heard. 
Byleth: Is that right?
Ignatz: They were trying to wipe out the goddess and her followers in hopes of taking back the surface. That's why they called themselves saviors. To their mind, they were.



Lysithea: It seems there are some Shambhala loyalists in Nemesis's forces. As long as they're around, we can expect them to continue with their cruel experiments.
Byleth: We must win.
Byleth: Let's wipe them out, then. 
Lysithea: Yes. We have to. It's the only way to ensure nobody else will go through what I went through. We must obliterate them in the next battle. It's the only recompense for Edelgard's death.



Marianne: Just when we thought we'd made it to the end, another enemy approaches... Can we be sure this battle is the last one?
Byleth: I don't know.
Marianne: Of course, there's no way to really know what will happen.
Byleth: This is it, I think. 
Marianne: I think you're right.
Marianne: Just a little further to the end. Come on, Professor. We have to win!



Hilda: My big brother challenged Nemesis. He knew he couldn't win. He just did it so that his friends could escape. He emerged from the battle with a terrible injury. It's a miracle he didn't die.
Byleth: I'm glad he made it. 
Hilda: Yeah. Me too.
Byleth: That was so noble of him.
Hilda: Well, maybe he should have been a little less noble. When you're dead, you're dead.
Hilda: Dying to save someone else...seems to defeat the purpose. I wouldn't do it. He's alive, and in spite of myself, I'm really proud of him.



Leonie: So, we're defending FÃ³dlan's future, huh? Kind of makes my mercenary ambitions feel pretty small. So I'll think about my promise to Captain Jeralt to protect you instead. That'll be my reason to fight.
Byleth: Thank you. 
Byleth: That works.
Leonie: If I can get you through this in one piece, that's just as good as defending FÃ³dlan's future, isn't it? I just hope he's watching.



Ferdinand: The javelins of light that destroyed Fort Merceus... They are what destroyed Shambhala. They were trying to shroud the city in darkness. Perhaps they were planning to swallow us up in that same darkness. Maybe the javelins of light were a signal to Nemesis. To awaken him from his long slumber. What do you think, Professor?
Byleth: I think you're exactly right. 
Ferdinand: Yes, indeed. I have done some good pondering here.
Byleth: I think you're way off the mark.
Ferdinand: Oh! Really? Hm. Maybe I got a couple of things wrong, but I thought I was pretty close...
Ferdinand: If we keep up this momentum, we will be able to take down Nemesis and restore peace in FÃ³dlan.



Linhardt: When you think of it, as one approaches the end of a war, the sacrifices only grow larger, don't they? The winning side musters their forces and attempts to strike a decisive blow... While those of the losing side make desperate attempts to turn the war in their favor. Neither side will give. I only wish we'd consider those who lose their lives in that struggle.
Byleth: We're far from being safe ourselves. 
Linhardt: Yes, exactly my point. Let's be careful to ensure we don't lose our lives, Professor.
Byleth: It's a necessary sacrifice.
Linhardt: Perhaps, but that doesn't make it any easier to accept your own survival depends on a throw of the dice.
Byleth: It's better than dragging the war out.
Linhardt: I can appreciate that, but just because a choice is better does not mean that it's good.



Caspar: Everyone in FÃ³dlan's united, but the Whatstheirfaces in the Dark or whatever won't let up! Let's get rid of 'em right away!
Byleth: Let's do it. 
Caspar: We gotta get some training in so we can crush 'em!
Byleth: We can't let our guard down.
Caspar: I know that! Come on, let's go train so we can crush 'em!
Caspar: There's not a lot of time, but I'm afraid we won't win if we don't train!

Bernadetta: The King of Liberation? The Fell King? His name is Nemesis, right? And he was hidden away for over a thousand years. Wow, that's a really long time all to himself... But that doesn't make him worth admiring, no matter how much I envy him!
Byleth: You really envy him?
Byleth: You'd like to be shut away for a thousand years? 
Bernadetta: Um. Maybe. Is that a trick question?



Dorothea: I keep thinking the war is near its end, then it isn't... When can we finally put this dreadful war behind us?
Byleth: Let's end it with the next battle.
Dorothea: That would be wonderful. Imagine, the last moment of combat...then peace. It sounds like a fairy tale. I want to make this a world a place where there is no fighting, where children can grow up happy and safe.
Byleth: There can be no end to war. 
Dorothea: I suppose you're right... But we should still try our best to make the world a place where children can grow up happy and safe.



Petra: I can feel a weight in the air. It is different from before. I do not know this Nemesis person, except what I have been reading. But I am not of FÃ³dlan. My knowledge of this person is very little. Even so, I feel that...I can understand it. I know that our enemy has great strength. I am...feeling great fear for this battle.
Byleth: Don't worry.
Petra: I have belief in you, Professor. Together, we will not be losing.
Byleth: I'm scared too. 
Petra: You have fear too? You do not look like you do... I have gratitude... I mean, I am grateful that you told me.



Felix: The Fell King Nemesis. Hmph. I imagine he'll be a worthy opponent. How many foes have tasted my blade? He will be an excellent finale. We will be victorious, Professor.
Byleth: Yes, we will!
Felix: Splendid. Let's do it.
Byleth: Calm down.
Felix: I'm perfectly calm, thank you.



Ashe: The King of Liberation wakes after a thousand-year slumber. Feels like I'm living a nightmare.
Byleth: I feel the same way. 
Ashe: You too? I hope you're not following my lead on this one, Professor!
Byleth: We must accept it.
Ashe: I know you're right, but it still doesn't feel real.
Ashe: Maybe this Nemesis who's attacking us isn't even the real thing. Either way, the damage and death he's causing are real enough. I will fight to protect those who need it.



Sylvain: Just when we think we're in the clear, the legendary Fell King resurrects. Who'd have thought it? Can you handle this getting any weirder? I don't know if I can.
Byleth: I can sympathize with you. 
Sylvain: I don't know how much of this Nemesis guy is a legend and how much is true, but I know this...
Byleth: No time for complaining.
Sylvain: I want toâ I'm going to survive. I've spent this whole war afraid I'd die. Not anymore. I'm going to live.
Sylvain: I mean, I'll still fight like I want to die because that's worked so far, and why change at this late date, right?

Sylvain: And if I'm right and I don't die, would you go have dinner with me sometime?



Mercedes: We went through all that trouble to finish the war, and now we have to fight again? What does this Nemesis fellow have against Garreg Mach anyway?
Byleth: A vendetta... 
Mercedes: A vendetta against Garreg Mach? That doesn't make much sense at all.
Byleth: I have no idea...
Mercedes: Well, it doesn't make much sense to me either.
Mercedes: At any rate, I'll do what I can to defend the monastery and Lady Rhea.



Annette: Is Lady Rhea OK? She was quite weakened to start, and then she took all those heavy injuries... I don't want to imagine it, but what will happen if Lady Rhea passes away like this?
Byleth: We'll cross that bridge if we come to it.
Annette: I suppose you're right.
Byleth: I'm sure she'll be fine. 
Annette: Yes. I'm praying every day that she'll get as well as soon as possible.
Annette: Come what may, we should all combine our talents and defend the peace of FÃ³dlan!



Ingrid: Shambhala is destroyed. But are they vanquished entirely, I wonder... Just as Kronya took Monica's form, perhaps there are some others living above ground.
Byleth: I don't know.
Byleth: Quite possibly. 
Ingrid: Once this battle is over, I still have much to see to. But right now, I should focus on the task at hand. On Nemesis. As long as Nemesis stands, both my future and the future of FÃ³dlan hang in the balance.



Seteth: Before the monastery was completed, there was a massive battle on the Tailtean Plains. In that battle, the warrior Seiros defeated the Fell King Nemesis and reclaimed the bones and heart of Sothis. Those make up the divine sword that you wield, and the Crest that you bear. Now, Rhea...Seiros...lies helpless. The only one who can defeat this so-called King of Liberation is the inheritor of divine power. You have our full and unwavering support. Only you can do this. Please, save this world.



Flayn: Please keep quiet. Rhea is sleeping right now. She does not appear to be very well. I beg of you, please do everything you can to prevent an assault from Nemesis.



Hanneman: Shambhala... An underground city with an entirely different lineage than the goddess? Shame phenomena, driven by a source totally alien to the Crests that we understand. Most unsettling! Could it be magic? Some manner of technology? I would like to know the truth of it all. Very much so. I want to know their history, their knowledge. Why do you suppose they chose this place to occupy?
Byleth: Well, I don't know.
Hanneman: I intend to carry out multiple excavations around the city. There is so much to learn! Yet first we face battle with a king who has defied time. Hmm, yes. The excavations can wait, I think.



Manuela: Life can be tough, you know? But if you've got your friends to help you through, it can be a lot easier. Maybe you butt heads sometimes...but that's OK. That's how you build bonds, right? And I've got friends, Professor. Plenty of those. It's true love that seems to have passed me by.
Byleth: You should relax.
Manuela: Relax? I'm relaxed.
Byleth: There's still hope. 
Manuela: But where is my true love to be found? Where is my ray of hope?
Byleth: Time to give up?
Manuela: Yeah... I'm starting to figure that's the most realistic option.
Manuela: At this point, I'm just hoping you stay single too. Then at least we can share each other's misery!



Alois: We thought we'd taken down the mastermind of this war, and then the Fell King Nemesis shows up! Well, no matter what evil creatures we have to face, this old soul will keep defending Garreg Mach. Not only Garreg Mach. Also Lady Rhea. Also you. I think Jeralt would be saying the same kind of thing if he were here right now.



Catherine: I try not to think about what would happen if Lady Rhea were harmed. I can't bear the thought of it. I'm not sure why the Fell King Nemesis picked right now to come back to life. But it makes me angry, that's for sure! Let's kick him back down into the dirt, where he belongs.



Shamir: Ghosts rising up from the ancient ruins... Heh... No matter how hard we push back, they don't stop coming. They're persistent. I'll give them that.



Cyril: I hear some super strong and evil fellas are after Lady Rhea. She just barely made it back to Garreg Mach, and then this has to go and happen? I'll protect Lady Rhea as best I can, and you're gonna do the same thing, aren't ya, Professor? Yeah, I know you will! Cut 'em down, Professor! Get every last one of those guys!



Judith: Did you hear? Our enemy is Nemesis. Unbelievable. It sounds so crazy, but there's no laughing it off. We must make our move before they reach the monastery.



Gatekeeper: Professor! I just have to say thanks! For everything! I'm on high alert today, so don't you worry about a thing. This mysterious military force approaching Garreg Mach... Is it true that Nemesis is with them?! It was Nemesis who led the 10 Elites against Saint Seiros. It's the stuff of legend. But this time, he won't have the 10 Elites on his side. Right? He won't, right?!

@Opening 
A military force bearing the Crest of Flames on its banner marches west to Garreg Mach from Shambhala, attacking nearby cities along the way. Rhea informs the Alliance that the enemy's general is none other than the ancient Fell King Nemesis. And so the Alliance army prepares for their final battle, hoping to put an end to FÃ³dlan's blood-stained history.

Shambhala has fallen, but a mysterious army has emerged from its ruins, bearing the Crest of Flames on its banner. Leading this force is Nemesis, the King of Liberation, presumed dead for a thousand years.

@Intro 
Claude: What's the plan, my friend?
Byleth: We will defeat Nemesis.
Claude: I thought you'd say that. And of course, I'll be joining you. What about the rest of you? Our enemy is a monster of legend. As always, there's not a shred of proof that we can win.
Lorenz: A foolish inquiry, Claude. I must finish what my father started...
Hilda: Started? Your father ran away before the battle even began.
Lorenz: I...well. All the more reason why I, as his heir, cannot flee now!
Hilda: I'm in. I need to get back at him for hurting my brother. I'm not going to let him get away with it!
Ignatz: Wow... Hilda's serious about this!
Lysithea: I too will fight until the end. I wish to protect FÃ³dlan's future.
Leonie: I feel the same as Lysithea. It would hardly be fitting for Captain Jeralt's apprentice to bow out now. I'll show them everything he taught me.
Marianne: I...I will give it my all as well! For the professor, for Claude, and for all of you who helped make me as strong as I am now!
Raphael: I'm in too! And when we're done, I'm gonna eat tons of steak to celebrate!
Ignatz: This truly is the final battle... At this point, you shouldn't have to ask, Claude. You know we're with you.
Claude: I do know that, Ignatz. But I had to ask just to make sure.
Judith: Heh. Look at how reliable you kids have become. You've trained them well, Professor. This Nemesis guy should be arriving soon. Is everyone ready?
Claude: It's finally time.
Byleth: I won't let us lose.
Byleth: I won't let any of you die.
Byleth: Let's win this... Together!
Claude: I'm on board with that. Let's all make it through this alive. Let's defeat this dusty old King of Liberation and put an end to this history of lies. Once we've done that, there'll be nothing holding us back. A new and brighter age will begin. Let's go, my friend! FÃ³dlan's new dawn awaits!

@Battle 
Claude: Nemesis is here...and with more soldiers than expected.
Hilda: A swamp, huh? But thereâs something about it... It looks odd somehow.
Agarthan Soldier: Agh! Canât...breathe...
Odesse: He should not have done that... Be careful. The water is poisonous to the living.
Claude: It looks like weâd better not get near that swamp... Try to avoid it during the fight!

Claude: Huh?! I think theyâve got some sort of magical link with Nemesis...
Marianne: Could the magic be protecting him?
Claude: Not sure, but weâd better take out his 10 commanders before taking him on.

Nemesis: Seiros! I will kill you! Do not get in my way!
Claude: So, that's Nemesis... You're a crusty old bastard, you know that?
Nemesis: All those who stand in my way...will be destroyed!
Raphael: Wah! Watch out, Claude! They're coming for us!


Claude: No effect!? So Nemesis is... invincible...

Claude: Nine more commanders remaining... We just killed number 10. These canât be the 10 Elites, can they? Nah, not likely.
Hilda: Look! The swampland cleared! 

Lorenz: Professor! Claude! All the subordinates to Nemesis have been eliminated!
Claude: It took some doing, but nowâs our chance to face off against Nemesis!

Claude: Agh! Demonic Beasts flying in from the south... Someone here must be able to summon them!
Lysithea: I sense an unusual presence. Someone may be hiding there.

Odesse: Argh... Thales!

Claude: Now he canât call any more Demonic Beasts. Time to see off his allies.

Claude: Now he canât call any more Demonic Beasts. And the remaining forces of Shambhala have been defeated too.

Ignatz: Whoa. The swampland vanished.

Hilda: Look! The swampland cleared!

@Boss 
%Claude,Riegan 
Claude: Hey... Can you speak?
Riegan: ...
Claude: Just puppets controlled by Nemesis... Well, theyâre the strongest puppets Iâve ever known.

@Boss
Nemesis: Feeble creature... Prepare to die!

%Byleth,Nemesis
Nemesis: That sword... You bear the Crest of Flames, just as I do!

@End 
Claude: That one seemed to work... Weâre almost done! Letâs go, my friend.

@Cutscene 
Nemesis: You are a foolish child.
Claude: Tough talk from a guy who's lived too long. Allow me to fix that!
Nemesis: You are all pathetic weaklings! You lack the courage to challenge me in lone combat.
Claude: Yet we have the strength to scale the walls between us, to reach our hands in friendship, so we can open our true hearts to one another! 
Claude: That's how we win!
Claude: Future historians will refer to this day as the new dawn of FÃ³dlan. Of that, I have no doubt.
Claude: It's up to you now Teach. As for my path...

@Narration 
A rising flame was alight as the flow of time carved a new history for FÃ³dlan. The ambitions of the Fell King Nemesis were crushed, averting what could have been the greatest crisis in the history of FÃ³dlan. After 5 and a half years of war, a new age was set to begin. Country, faith, history...All that had once formed the order of the world was wiped clean. The heroes whose very hands saved FÃ³dlan from a dark fate commenced with the building of a new society. The leaders of this new unified FÃ³dlan began their walk down a seemly endless path-one toward a world that would cherish differences in race and belief, one where all life would be valued equally. Those clung to the hope that their path would not end with FÃ³dlanâthat it would someday span the seas to Dagda and beyond the Throat to Almyra...

@Opening 
Having repelled the Imperial vanguard, the Alliance army requests reinforcements from Judith, head of House Daphnel - the governing body in the northwestern regions of Alliance territory.

@Dialogue 
Raphael: What? Not enough left for seconds? I'm barely half full!
Cyril: Ya eat too much anyways, Raphael. Supplies are running low, so you're just gonna have to deal with it.
Ignatz: You've always been so level-headed, Cyril. Now that you've grown up, you're even more that way.
Cyril: Maybe it's just that the rest of you haven't grown enough. You could work harder at being reliable.
Raphael: I can't grow if I can't eat!
Hilda: I have some good news for my hungry friends... We got a reply from Judith!
Hilda: Mr. Leader Man has called a meeting about it. Hurry up, everyone!


Claude: We finally received a reply from Judith. The Hero of Daphnel has agreed to support us with soldiers and supplies.
Raphael: She's gonna give us food? She really is a hero!
Cyril: Maybe Raphael will simmer down now.
Claude: Now, regarding where we're going to receive the delivery...

Judith: As this is a request from none other than the leader of the Alliance, I wish that I could send troops at once. However... Openly marshaling soldiers within my territory could provoke other members of the Alliance. Therefore, I will secretly gather troops in Ailell, the Valley of Torment. Will your group be able to receive the soldiers at this location? From there, it should be safe to return to the monastery by following the border between the Alliance and the Kingdom.

Byleth: Ailell, the Valley of Torment...
Claude: Ailell is on the border between the Daphnel territory and the Kingdom. It'll make sense when we get there, but it's a peculiar region.
Marianne: I recall there being a scary legend about it...
Claude: In any case, if we use that valley, we shouldn't have to worry about being noticed by other Alliance lords.
Alliance Soldier: Ailell, the Valley of Torment...

@Conversation 
Claude: You know... I'd never have been recognized as the legitimate heir to House Riegan without Judith's recommendation... Feels like I'm digging myself deeper and deeper in debt to the Hero of Daphnel, but what do you do? It's all been worth it. After all, we need the Daphnel army for our next move. It's possible we'll have to deal with our enemy sooner than later. Be prepared, Teach.



Lorenz: The bridge that links Alliance and Empire lands is currently under the occupation of the Imperial army. In other words, the Empire can choose to invade the Alliance whenever they wish. I want you to understand that my father does not support the Empire to antagonize House Riegan. He does it to deprive them of an easy excuse to cross that bridge.



Raphael: Sharing her food with us for nothing in return? Judith really is a great person! She's more like a goddess than the goddess is!
Byleth: She is very much like a goddess. 
Raphael: I never met her, so I don't know for sure, but she must be beautiful and kind.
Byleth: I'm not sure about that.
Raphael: No? Well, she could be a demon for all I care, so long as she feeds me!



Ignatz: The Valley of Torment... I'd heard of it, but I never expected to go there. It's exciting! I wonder what the landscape is like.
Byleth: It sounds dangerous.
Ignatz: It probably is dangerous, but I still want to get there and see it as soon as I can.
Byleth: It sounds painful. 
Ignatz: Hm, that is an interesting point... The name does seem to suggest that.



Lysithea: Ailell, the Valley of Torment, lies on the border of three noble territories. The Kingdom's Fraldarius and Galatea families, and the Alliance's Daphnel family. In the Fraldarius lands to the north, the former Kingdom army and new duke's army are fighting.



Marianne: Valley of Torment... Valley of Torment...
Byleth: Something wrong? 
Marianne: I once read a book full of legends surrounding Ailell, but I can't seem to remember...
Byleth: Are you chanting some sort of curse?
Marianne: N-no... I'm trying to remember the legends surrounding Ailell...



Hilda: My big brother told me stories of Judith's bravery. With just one look, she tamed a runaway horse that nobody else had been able to touch. When an Almyran general provoked her, she talked him into a tearful apology. She's spectacular. I wish she'd fight alongside us.



Leonie: You're not a teacher anymore, and we're not your students, but everyone still calls you Professor. Is there something you'd rather be called?
Byleth: Professor is fine.
Leonie: Guess that's what we're used to, huh? All right.
Byleth: Call me by my name. 
Leonie: Oh? All right, then. I'll call you - ugh. Nope! Sorry, can't do it. Too weird.



Ferdinand: Some day we will take the Imperial capital. It is odd to think that I will be invading the very city that I once called home. Ah, that is still a ways off. I will prepare for our journey to Ailell.



Linhardt: I never do get used to the sight of blood. It always makes me feel as if I might faint. Have I never told you that? Huh. Oh well. I hope this war ends soon. I dislike being lightheaded because other people are bleeding everywhere. Though the thought of working hard for it does sound like quite a pain...



Caspar: I didn't think we'd end up fighting Randolph... He's my uncle. Well, not by blood, so... I guess I can handle it.
Byleth: I'm still worried about you.
Byleth: You're very resolute. 
Caspar: Don't worry about me. I'm ready for anything.


Bernadetta: Ailell, the Valley of Torment? What kind of a name for a place is that? It sounds scary. Do I really have to go with you? Hey, um, here's an idea... Maybe let the recluse stay home and hold the fort!



Dorothea: Hey, Professor, thanks for your hard work again! Nothing to report today! Was I convincing? Was it like he was standing right in front of you? Some things are the same as they were five years ago, but I guess a lot more has changed...



Petra: Since the past, I have learned much of the language of FÃ³dlan. But speaking the FÃ³dlan language still gives me difficulty. I can understand, read, and write with nearly perfection now. But understanding and speaking are...fruits of a different color.
Byleth: That's part of your charm 
Petra: I have gratitude for you, Professor. I hope that I will have fluency one day.
Byleth: Everyone has a weak spot.
Petra: Yes. I will keep practicing more.



Felix: Some in Faerghus believe Dimitri is still alive. My father is one such eccentric. Hmph, they can't accept reality. Dimitri is dead. He's not coming back.



Sylvain: Ailell, the Valley of Torment. Aw, man... I really do not want to go there.
Byleth: Pull yourself together.
Sylvain: Professor, have you ever been to Ailell? If you had, you'd know.
Byleth: Why not? 
Sylvain: That place is crazy hot! For guys like me who grew up somewhere cold? Man... It's gonna be rough. Though, I guess that climate will keep our enemies at bay.



Mercedes: We may not be students anymore, but it's still important to read. We might even learn something that's useful for our next battle.
Byleth: Studying is important.
Mercedes: I couldn't agree more! I hope the Officers Academy reopens when the war is over.
Byleth: Training is important too.
Mercedes: I suppose that may be true. I always try my best at both.
Mercedes: It's a shame the monastery was ruined but...At least the books are still intact!



Annette: Professor, how do Claude and Judith know each other? I hear there are still quarrels within the Alliance... This generous offer of soldiers and supplies seems a little too good to be true. I mean, itâs also really impressive, but Iâm just a little worried, I suppose...



Ingrid: My family, the Galateas, are an offshoot of the Daphnel family. The family split in half when two brothers quarreled over an inheritance. Despite blood relations, the families lived apart from one another, so the relationship has been distant and somewhat estranged. Iâm not so much acquainted with Judith, the head of House Daphnel.



Seteth: Meeting reinforcements in the Valley of Torment seems an astute decision to me. In that land of oppressive heat, it is unlikely that we will be disturbed. It also means we will need to contend with those harsh conditions ourselves, however. Best ensure we are well prepared.



Flayn: It has been only five years, yet so much has changed. Half of the Kingdom has fallen to the Empire. Skirmishes are rife throughout the Alliance. Despite such tumult, we look upon the same sky, unchanged by the storm happening beneath it.
Byleth: Do you wish you could return to those days?
Flayn: Yes, it would be nice, I suppose. Things were... simpler then. Or so they seemed to be, at the time.
Byleth: It's true - it's just like it was all those years ago. 
Flayn: Indeed. I gazed up at the same sky with Mother and Father. It does not feel so long ago at all. Wait, but how would you know, Professor?



Hanneman: The monastery repairs have made solid progress. Most excellent news. When we first returned here, I was unsure what we were going to do with the ruins of this place... But if we can get the cathedral rebuilt, we'll have it looking just like the old times soon enough.



Manuela: Hearing that an old student has died cuts me right to the heart... As this war with the Empire continues, we'll see more of it, Professor. We have a duty to fight alongside our former students. We taught them how to fight, after all. Now, let's help them win!



Alois: Even though we're getting reinforcements, we should still be prepared for the worst. Never shirk your training, no matter what. To practice, I'm going to chop something up with my sword. Unless you'd like to train together! Care to spar?



Catherine: I've heard people talk about the Hero of Daphnel. If the stories of her courage are true, no one will be able to stand against us. In different circumstances, I'd have wanted to try crossing swords with her. Right now we have to focus on getting to those reinforcements. Let's hope nothing goes wrong.



Shamir: There are enemy spies around. Remain vigilant. Capture anyone who seems suspicious.
Byleth: To kill them?
Shamir: What else would we do with them?
Byleth: All right, I will. 
Shamir: I'm glad you understand. I'm counting on you.



Cyril: Gotta clean out the storerooms, tend the flowers, do the washing, dust the library...
Byleth: That sounds like a lot of work.
Cyril: Well, it's my job, ya know? Gotta do your job.
Byleth: Do you need any help? 
Cyril: Nah, this is my job. Lady Rhea herself gave it do me.
Cyril: Even if Lady Rhea's not here right now, I still gotta do my duty.
Cyril: Like you. You gotta have other stuff you oughta be doing, yeah?



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Is everyone setting out on a big campaign? Not exactly? Ah, so you're meeting up with the reinforcements. We'll, you can leave guarding this place to me! I'll keep an eye out for anything suspicious!

@Opening 
In response to the Alliance Army's plea, Judith has agreed to provide soldiers. To meet up with reinforcements, the Alliance army sets out for Ailell, the Valley of Torment. Unbeknownst to Claude, something else awaits them there...

Your party travels to Ailell, the Valley of Torment, to meet up with allied troops and secure reinforcements. It should have been a safe march...

@Intro 
Hilda: Ugh, why is it so hot? I'm getting all sweaty!
Raphael: Don't be a wimp! Anything's worth it for more food supplies.
Leonie: Move over, Raphael. Somehow you make the heat even worse.
Ignatz: Let's stay calm, everyone. Once we meet up with Judith's soldiers, we can go right back home.
Marianne: Oh, I finally remembered! The legend goes that this valley was born from the wrath of the goddess...
Marianne: They say a pillar of light poured from the heavens and completely burned away the forest that used to be here...
Claude: So you're telling me the goddess, who is supposed to be benevolent, burned a forest to a crisp? Typical.
Marianne: That's what the legend would have us believe. But it's not recorded in any of the scriptures...
Claude: Either it's completely made up, or the goddess is some kind of monster.
Cyril: Huh? Is that...
Lorenz: The time for idle chatter is over, Claude. Look over there.
Claude: Ah, has someone come to greet us?
Byleth: Enemies?
Byleth: Allies?
Lorenz: That banner does not bear the Daphnel Crest.
Claude: If memory serves... That's the Crest of House Rowe, formerly lords of the Kingdom. They joined the Empire's side without hesitation during the coup. And now here they are, lying in wait for us.
Shamir: Damn... I thought we had disposed of all the spies...
Lorenz: House Rowe is mediocre and vulgar, but I hear their knights are powerful.
Hilda: What about the Daphnel soldiers? You don't think...
Byleth: I'm worried about Judith.
Claude: Judith will be fine. It would take a lot more than that to take her down.
Byleth: We need to break through their ranks.
Claude: We've already been spotted, so there's no time to come up with a brilliant plan.
Claude: Everyone, prepare for battle! I leave the command in your capable hands, my friend.

@Battle 
Gwendal: The Valley of Torment... Perhaps a good place to finish off my life as a knight. Only if that puny force of children is able to kill me, of course...
Claude: So, their general must be that stubborn-looking old man. He looks like he wouldn't even forgive a sobbing child. It's good we came armed for the occasion. Care to find Judith?

Claude: Flames are flaring everywhere and burning people where they stand... Ailell is a terrible place. Everyone, if you don't want to get burned to a crisp, watch your step!

Gwendal: The Crest of Flames? Ha! Quite full of themselves, aren't they?
Ashe: Just as I thought - the professor's army. But it's too late to back out now. In Lonato's place, I have to do my duty.

Judith: Oh, old Gwendal is here. And he doesn't look to be an ally...
Gwendal: Oh, the Hero of Daphnel is here! I'll expect more from her than the young ones...
Defeat Conditions: All of your units fall in battle, or Judith is defeated.

Kingdom Soldier: Here we go! Attack them from both sides!

@Battle-Talk 
%Claude,Judith
Judith: So, you're finally here, supreme leader. And something extra has tagged along.
Claude: Sorry, Judith. That rat got away.
Judith: Hey, don't worry. And here, you should have this. Perhaps it will come in handy.

@Boss 
Gwendal: Does a whelp like you really expect to kill me? I am Gwendal, the Gray Lion, a knight by the hand of Count Rowe! Do your worst!

Gwendal: Ah, so I have found a place to die... Young ones... I thank you...
Claude: That old man must have been struggling with the position he found himself in... It's time to gather ourselves and pull back our troops.

@End 
Judith: To think we'd get into a scrap here of all places. We're lucky we all made it out alive.
Byleth: I'm sorry for involving you in this.
Judith: Don't worry about it. In this day and age, it's a miracle I've been unscathed this long.
Byleth: I can see why they call you a hero.
Judith: Well, that's ancient history.
Judith: Anyway, long time no see, Professor! Are you still watching this boy's back?
Claude: Can you quit calling me a boy in front of everyone? I'm the leader of the Alliance now. It's not proper-
Judith: Not proper, is it? Says the leader who has neglected Alliance territory for years. If you're really the Master Tactician, you should go back to working quietly at whatever little desk you do your planning on.
Claude: Ugh, don't call me that either. Who even came up with that nickname?
Judith: It's a perfect title for a boy who loves crafty schemes as much as you do. You should be grateful to the professor. On your own, you'd look like a scoundrel of a leader.
Hilda: Haha! Claude's usually so flippant, but even he gets overwhelmed when Judith is around!
Lorenz: As expected from the leader of the prestigious House Daphnel. Her dignity if beyond compare, even if she is no longer one of the Five Great Lords.
Byleth: The Five Great Lords?
Byleth: The prestigious House Daphnel?
Lorenz: The five most influential lords of the Leicester Alliance. They hold the voting rights at the roundtable conferences. House Daphnel used to be included among their ranks, but division from within has hastened their decline. Their vote has since been passed to the emerging Margrave Edmund.
Judith: Thanks for the exposition, Gloucester boy.
Lorenz: Boy?! I will not-
Judith: Now to business. There were some unexpected interruptions, but I've brought soldiers and supplies, as promised.
Claude: Thanks, Judith. I'll gladly take them off your hands...
Judith: Hold your horses, boy. You're misunderstanding. These soldiers are precious to me. I made them what they are. I'm not about to loan them out to someone.
Claude: No? Then why did you come here?!
Judith: What I'm saying is that I'll be joining your army. You're going to fight the Empire with the Knights of Seiros, right? Fight for Lady Rhea? Not without me.
Claude: That's admirable and all, but we still don't know for sure if Rhea is in the-
Judith: Oh, she's there. A witness saw Lady Rhea being dragged off by the Imperial army after the battle five years ago.
Alois: Are you sure your source is reliable?!
Judith: One of my own saw it happen. I'm certain.
Alois: It seems we chose wisely when we decided to fight against the Empire.
Claude: But you're the leader of House Daphnel. Is it OK for you to leave your territory unattended?
Judith: And what about you? Is it OK for you to leave the Riegan territory unattended?
Claude: That's... I've left it in the hands of a reliable retainer and-
Judith: And I've asked that retainer to watch over Daphnel territory as well.
Claude: Wait, wait, wait... You just up and decided to get my retainer to do that without even asking me? No respect, this one...
Byleth: What retainer?
Judith: Oh? You haven't met him yet, Professor? His name is Nardel. He strikes me as a really special individual. And he's quite handsome too!
Claude: So that's your definition of handsome?
Judith: No objections, then? Good. That settles it. House Daphnel is now yours to command.
Claude: I'm sure you'd come along even if I refused. So be it. We'll be counting on you, Judith.

Claude: With Judith joining our forces, we've secured some more troops and supplies... albeit not many.
Judith: Hmph. I'm sorry it couldn't be more.
Claude: No, it's enough for the time being. We'll use them to secure even more troops and supplies.
Byleth: How so?
Byleth: You think we can do that?
Claude: The key to my plan is Count Gloucester, the leader of the pro-Empire faction in the Alliance.
Lorenz: You intend to sway my father to join the other side?
Claude: If Count Gloucester were to switch to the other side, that would basically unify the Alliance. Then we could utilize our full military force in the fight against the Empire.
Lorenz: You don't mean to ask me to persuade him, do you? That would be... quite impossible.
Claude: I don't plan on it. We'll just take his concerns out of the equation. The Airmid River flows along the border between Gloucester territory and the Empire, right? Of all the bridges that cross it, the Great Bridge of Myrddin is the only one near Gloucester territory large enough for an army. Currently, the Imperial army occupies it.
Lysithea: So, if we were to capture the bridge...
Claude: Count Gloucester would be freed from the threat of the Empire. Thanks to us.
Lysithea: But we have to pass through Gloucester territory to reach the Great Bridge of Myrddin, do we not?
Claude: Yes. And if we attempted it, naturally he would try to stop us.
Lorenz: I am sorry, but I must ask. Surely you do not plan to engage in combat with my father?
Claude: Don't worry. I want him as a future ally. What good would it do to waste both of our forces fighting?
Byleth: I take it you have a scheme?
Claude: Who do you think you're taking to, Teach? Preparations are in the works even now.
Byleth: So, we'll be sneaking through?
Claude: We can't be stealthy with so many people. But I have a scheme. Preparations are already in the works.
Judith: So the Master Tactician is finally going to show us his true power. I'm looking forward to it!
Claude: I'll do my best to live up to that name by making my scheme as impressive as possible.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Immediately following Edelgard's defeat, the Alliance army discovers the existence of another adversary - a group operating behind the scenes within the Empire. Claude suspects that if the true enemy is left unchecked, disaster will befall FÃ³dlan. And so he cuts short the celebration, and the troops head for Shambhala, where this foe resides.

@Dialogue 
Claude: I just don't get it...
Leonie: What is it, Claude?
Claude: Those javelins of light... They were trying to use it to kill us at Fort Merceus, right? But then why not drop it on Garreg Mach? They must have known for a while that we were here.

Rhea: It is not that they chose to refrain, but rather that they were unable to do so.
Claude: Rhea! How are you feeling?
Rhea: I am well enough... I cannot afford to rest while FÃ³dlan is in danger.
Claude: What do you mean when you say they couldn't drop a javelin of light here?
Rhea: Once, a very long time ago, a massive ball of light fell upon this monastery. However, that light mysteriously changed course in mid-air and landed in Ailell instead.
Leonie: Ailell, the Valley of Torment... So that's what the wreckage of those javelins of light looks like.
Rhea: The Holy Tomb is not only the location of the progenitor god's eternal slumber, but also a sacred vessel for a power that repels evil. Supposedly, the progenitor god built the Holy Tomb herself to protect her children from the evil light.
Claude: So the children of the goddess gathered in Zanado because of its proximity to the monastery? But we've fought at distant locations many times.
Leonie: Despite that, the javelins of light only fell on Fort Merceus.
Judith: In his letter, Hubert said that he detected their magic when the fort fell. In other words, because they used a javelin of light, Hubert was able to pinpoint the location of their base.
Leonie: So they didn't use it before then because they didn't want us to know where their base is?
Claude: In any case, those javelins of light must be something they can't just use whenever they want. And they finally decided to use one at Merceus, where they were sure they'd be able to finish us off. It's only thanks to the whims of the Death Knight that we escaped with our lives. And no javelins of light have fallen since then.
Judith: It's possible that the enemy hasn't yet realized that we've learned the location of their base.
Claude: If so, their guard may be down, which makes this the perfect time for a surprise attack.
Rhea: I will accompany you.
Seteth: What?! No! That would be far too dangerous! Your long confinement weakened you greatly, did it not?
Rhea: Those people have opposed us since ancient times. I wish to learn the truth about them for myself.
Seteth: I... I understand. I will not stop you, but please take care not to overexert yourself.
Claude: We don't know exactly what we're up against here, but having you around is very reassuring, Rhea. Let's prepare to strike at Shambhala before they make their next move!

@Conversation 
Claude: We crushed the Empire at long last... But there's no time to bask in our victory. We must prepare for the coming battle. We knew there was a secret group behind the Imperial army all this time. Now, we have a chance to make the first move against them. We have Hubert to thank for that. It's also thanks to him that we were able to rescue Rhea. I still have plenty of questions I'd like to ask her.
Byleth: Are you going to see her?
Claude: Well, if we plan to have her march into battle with us again, we'd better let her recuperate.
Byleth: We should let her rest. 
Claude: Rhea is the only one who gets a break, though. Everyone else had better start preparing for battle.



Lorenz: A mysterious power, threatening the very future of FÃ³dlan? Certainly we cannot give it leeway. In comparison to this, the internal power struggles in the Alliance are utterly trivial.
Byleth: Aren't you frightened? 
Lorenz: Fear will serve no purpose here. The only path to survival is victory.
Byleth: Do you think we can defeat it?
Lorenz: There is simply no option but victory! The alternative is unthinkable.
Lorenz: Perhaps I will have the opportunity to strike the decisive blow on the enemy commander. That would secure my place in history for certain!



Raphael: Wake up, eat, train, eat, train, eat, sleep. We gotta prepare for the assault, but that hasn't changed my routine!
Byleth: You're doing plenty. 
Byleth: Isn't there more you can do?
Raphael: All the training... and eating... I do is for the sake of FÃ³dlan! Gotta stay strong... and fed... to keep it safe!



Ignatz: Our next opponent is an ally of Solon. Do you remember what Solon called us?
Byleth: Traitors?
Ignatz: No. He called us beasts.
Byleth: Beasts? 
Ignatz: That's right. He called us beasts.
Byleth: Insects?
Ignatz: No. He called us beasts.
Ignatz: Meanwhile, he refers to himself as the Savior. Who exactly is he saving?



Lysithea: Those who slither in the dark... It seems we'll finally discover their true form. I get the sense that they're in league with the mages who experimented on me as a child. I wouldn't be surprised if Edelgard was subjected to them too. There's no telling what their true motives are. But whatever their motives, what they have done is unforgivable. They must be exterminated.



Marianne: I thought the war would end with Edelgard's defeat... But that wasn't the case. This may be premature, but I'm feeling a little relieved. I have to consider what I'll do with myself and where I'll go when this war is finally over... I don't have an answer yet... Let's make sure the next battle puts an end to this war. That way we can all move forward!



Hilda: Shambhala it was called, right? Scary that it's so close to the House Goneril territories. Who'd have thought all those creeps were living right under my nose? I was hoping my big brother would help us in this next battle. But he says that I can represent House Goneril without his help. That I have it in me. I'm glad he recognizes that I have some ability. Still, I wish he wasn't leaving it all to me.



Leonie: These are Monica's people, aren't they? The ones who killed Captain Jeralt. Then this is my real opportunity for revenge. There's no way I can back down from this one.
Byleth: You're not scared? 
Leonie: No, I'm OK. Actually, I'm eager to get our there and fight. This is what I've been training for.
Byleth: I wonder if we can win.
Leonie: If we lose, it's the end for FÃ³dlan. So we have to win, even if it kills us.



Ferdinand: The history of the Empire spans 1185 years. And just like that, it ends. But the Hresvelg legacy could live on... When Edelgard assumed power, there were no other rightful heirs. She said that whoever takes the throne next should do so by virtue of merit, not blood. And she truly meant what she said. At any rate, I feel that a huge hole has opened up in my heart. Who knows if it can ever be filled?



Linhardt: As history proves, everything comes to an end eventually. I knew that all along, but it still came as a surprise. Those who slither in the dark... It's all so fascinating and strange. They must certainly have a long history of their own. And when they fall, that will come quickly too. Don't you think? Heh, that almost sounded like a prophecy there. Am I spooking you yet?



Caspar: He's dead... My father's dead... I'm OK though. Really. I was ready for it. He was a general in the Imperial army, after all. Minister of Military Affairs... He gave his own life so the Empire's soldiers wouldn't have to lose theirs. That's a fight that only he could take on. He was such a tough guy. This whole time I fought side by side with you and Claude... But did I ever get any stronger? Will I ever be as strong as my father?

Bernadetta: With Edelgard gone, maybe FÃ³dlan will finally find some peace. That's all well and good, but, um... She was also the one to put my father under house arrest, so now he's been released, and he's taken charge of House Varley. I can't handle it! I can't deal with him! Please, you have to do something!
Byleth: How about we exile him? 
Byleth: We can put him back under arrest.
Bernadetta: Thank you so much!



Dorothea: So, the moment we defeat Edie, the nobles cozy up to the Alliance and church... That lot really does think only of themselves, and no one else. But then there's Count Bergliez. He used to be Minister of Military Affairs... He sacrificed his own life so that all the soldiers and officers who fought could be given quarter... When I heard that... I don't know... that simple act of humanity... I couldn't help it. I burst into tears. You know Count Bergliez is Casper's father, right? I can't even imagine how Caspar must feel about it.



Petra: The Empire has broken in... in smithereens. Now it is possible for me to go back to Brigid. But... I cannot choose that choice. The time is still too soon for that. We must be stopping the evil for everyone in FÃ³dlan. We will be fighting until the end of it!



Felix: I thought that after the Empire fell, the boar might finally be avenged... But something dark is certainly lurking in the shadows - an organization behind the Empire. We'll have to take care of them if the boar... if Dimitri is to rest in peace.



Ashe: We've all heard the legend of Nemesis, the King of Liberation. But now Lady Rhea is saying Nemesis was just some kind of thief. Those two descriptions are totally at odds. Which version's correct? I don't know what to think. But I guess that's the nature of history. I wonder what the generations that come after us will say about the battle we're about to fight.



Sylvain: This war might be over but not war in general. Human beings thrive on conflict. We can't get enough of it. I don't know when, but you know someday another war will begin.
Byleth: Even so... 
Sylvain: Heh heh... That's the way it is, right?
Byleth: You're probably right about that.
Sylvain: Yeah, but the fight is still worth it.
Sylvain: War may always come back but so will peace. And peace is what we fight for.



Mercedes: Lady Rhea still seems weak... but at least she's safe now. I'm praying that she'll be well as soon as possible. Goddess... I beg you... Protect Lady Rhea!



Annette: Finally, that awful war is over. Everyone lost something, and everyone had to make sacrifices... But maybe we can put a stop to all of this pain and loss now. Let's hurry to Shambhala, Professor! We have to defeat them if we ever want to see a world without war.



Ingrid: Is it really prudent to bring Lady Rhea on our upcoming expedition? It would be best not to have her doing anything strenuous, considering how long she was confined...
Byleth: It's her decision, ultimately. 
Byleth: I feel similarly.
Ingrid: There are still many in FÃ³dlan who are seeking Lady Rhea's salvation.





Seteth: Rhea is sleeping right now. If it is not absolutely urgent, please do not disturb her rest. The long confinement took its toll on her health. Truthfully, she is in no shape to be exerting herself at all â to say nothing of a military expedition. To make matters worst, we are now facing a very old enemy. One that has conspired against us since time out of mind. Please proceed with caution. I have a bad feeling.



Flayn: I am so glad that Rhea is unharmed. My brother continues to worry about her, however. Of course, I am worried myself. I cannot imagine being in that situation while in such a state... She should just leave things to you and Claude and get the rest she needs...



Hanneman: A mysterious organization, slithering in the dark of FÃ³dlan... Like something out of a midnight tale. It appears these fiends have infiltrated the deepest corners of the Empire. After the fall of Enbarr, they've remained well concealed... That said, I would keep an eye on Edelgard's uncle, Lord Arundel. Something about him sits ill with me.



Manuela: Professor! Most of the opera company fled, but theyâre back in the capital now. I donât know if everyone survived, but it looks like they should be able to mount a revival. They even asked if Iâd consider making a return to the stage someday... I suspect I may refuse though. Weâre at the dawn of something new. No reason to look backwards, eh?



Alois: You've done it. You did it. You crushed the Empire, and rescued Lady Rhea. I'm sure the captain is proud of you right now. As am I, of course! I'm as proud as if I'd done it myself!
Byleth: Let's not celebrate just yet. 
Byleth: We still have opponents left to fight.
Alois: Sorry. I didn't mean to overdo it. We still have Monica's group... Those who killed the captain. We'll knock 'em down so hard that they can't get back up!



Catherine: We rescued Lady Rhea! I can hardly express my joy. But now we know about a new foe, who intends to bring her harm. In time, we'll realize the peaceful world that Lady Rhea has always hoped for. I'll have to keep that in mind when I'm fighting.



Shamir: We saved Rhea and the Empire has crumbled. The Kingdom may as well be finished too. The reasons for me to remain in FÃ³dlan are fading.
Byleth: Please, stay with us a little longer. 
Shamir: Of course. I've come this far. May as well see it through to the end.
Byleth: Is it time to bid farewell?
Shamir: That's a little hasty. I've come this far. May as well see it through to the end.



Cyril: Lady Rheaâs back! Lady Rheaâs back! Iâm so happy! But... things arenât gonna be like they used to be any time soon, are they? Thereâs still folks out there who want us all dead, and Lady Rhea still hasnât regained her strength yet. Speaking of which, Professor, please donât ask too much of her right now, OK?



Judith: The folks we're fighting next aren't normal humans, are they? It's that group who caused the javelin of light to fall, right? It just doesn't seem like something a human is capable of. I'm not prone to flinching, but I don't feel great about any of this...



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! I can hardly believe you managed to handle the capital city like that. Everyone did sterling work! I really thought we'd know peace after the battle. But we're not quite there yet, huh?

@Intro 
Lysithea: Incredible... Who knew that there was such a vast space beneath the ground...
Judith: It's like an underground city. I've never seen buildings like these before.
Lysithea: It's like an ancient ruin... But not just because of its appearance.
Ignatz: I don't recall ever seeing architecture like this.
Lorenz: It is magnificent in a sense, but I could hardly call it beautiful, Even the air feels stagnant.
Claude: In any case, it seems like we need to go further. Let's look around and see if we can find some stairs.

Rhea: ...
Byleth: Something on your mind?
Byleth: Are you not feeling well?
Rhea: No. It is simply... We must defeat those who slither in the dark, no matter what happens. But if my conjecture is correct, the one who they will wish to kill the most...

Rhea: Is you, dear child.
Byleth: Why me?
Rhea: They are aware that you can use the Sword of the Creator. Your body houses the same power they once bestowed upon Nemesis. That is why...I fear for you.
Byleth: That's not much to go on.
Rhea: Perhaps. Please forgive my errant thoughts. Once this battle is over... I will explain everything. I will tell you all I know about who you really are.

@Opening 
Though the flame of war is quenched, its embers endure. You travel deep underground to confront those who slither in the dark and bring lasting peace to FÃ³dlan.

@Battle 
Thales: For thousands of years, we have existed underground, living on only that we might someday see our vengeance realized. Here and now, that vengeance is finally within our grasp. There is but one thing left to do. Destroy them! Damn those who stand with that arrogant goddess to oblivion, away from the world of the living!

Thales: Now is the time. Remove the binding spell of Titanus. Let their metal bodies be drenched in blood!
Claude: Hey, what are those big...things?
Rhea: Demonic Beasts... No, I think not. They appear to have no will of their own. Someone must be controlling them.
Thales: Initiate all that remain! We must advance our preparations!

Thales: Viskam has been activated? Increase output gradually, depending on the amount of magical energy charged. I don't care if we destroy Shambhala, as long as our goals are fulfilled!

Rhea: Those awful weapons have been stopped. They were being controlled from that facility!

Claude: Aw, those big things have gone to sleep on us. That will make moving around a lot easier. A dead end? Or perhaps... No, if we worry about every little detail, we won't get anywhere.

Thales: You!
Rhea: That is the leader of those who slither in the dark. We must go after him with all our might!

Claude: It seems someone is trying to remove something. Weâd better capture them first!

@Boss 
Thales: Youâre nothing but animals performing tricks in the hopes of pleasing the goddess. You will never see the sunlight again!

%Byleth,Thales
Thales: So you have shown yourself, Fell Star. Or, should I say...Sothis? I will spill every drop of blood in your body to fulfill the longstanding goal of the Agarthans!

%Seteth,Thales
Thales: Your eyes, hair, ears, and blood...We remember it all. We remember how you ruined us. How you stole our light and condemned us to eternal darkness! Now, suffer the wrath of the Agarthans!

%Claude,Thales
Thales: Ha. It is laughable that base animals such as you would bare fangs at the likes of us.
Claude: I may be a base animal, but I have strong allies. Do you think you can beat Teach and the Sword of the Creator?
Thales: The Sword of the Creator... The blade given to Nemesis. Who do you really think is superior?
Claude: Thereâs a big difference between the living and the dead. The fate of the future lies in the hands of the living!

@Cutscene 
Thales: You will never get to enjoy your victory.

Rhea: It can't be...

Thales: For all Agarthans... Let there be light!

Soldier: It's coming down!



Nemesis: Seiros...

@End 
Rhea: Ugh...
Cyril: Hang in there, Lady Rhea.
Catherine: Get her to her room, quickly!
Manuela: That's a serious injury... It's a miracle that she's even alive right now. I'll do what I can, but...

Marianne: Goddess... Please save Lady Rhea...
Hilda: All we can do now is pray...

Claude: Remember when this place was taken five years ago, and a pure White Beast appeared on the battlefield? I only caught a glimpse of it, but I didn't understand where it came from. There were rumors that the goddess sent it to protect the monastery... But now I know better. That beast was Rhea.
Byleth: She tried to save me...
Claude: Did you know Rhea's true identity?
Byleth: Looking back on it now, I suppose I did.
Claude: I once showed you a picture of a creature known as the Immaculate One. Seteth confiscated it, saying it must have been one of Tomas' personal possessions. The beast that appeared back then looked just like it. So Rhea is the Immaculate One. The book said it was a servant of the goddess, but wouldn't it make sense if beasts like that are actually children of the goddess?
Byleth: ...
Claude: Rhea is in a grim state right now. It's possible she may not make it. But we have things we must ask her about. Once things calm down a little, let's go and see Rhea. Together. The truth can't be delayed any longer.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Now in control of the Great Bridge of Myrddin, the Alliance army invades the Imperial territories. In response, the Imperial army garrisons soldiers at Fort Merceus.

@Dialogue 
Claude: All of that went about as well as it could have. Each lord has agreed to provide us with soldiers and supplies.
Judith: I'm impressed you were able to convince all of those scattered nobles to help us. I thought they would quarrel about how much support they should each provide. That's what they usually do.
Claude: Well, Count Gloucester took the initiative in taking on responsibilities. I presume that was because you spoke with him in advance, Lorenz?
Lorenz: I merely explained the situation at hand, then my father simply followed your lead, Claude. It was because you had the professor there to represent Lady Rhea. My father is a pious follower of the Church of Seiros.
Claude: I don't doubt it. I wasn't under the delusion that it was my personal charm that unified everyone. Thanks for that, by the way. I hope you don't feel like I used you... because I sort of used you.
Byleth: Don't mention it.
Claude: I appreciate that. We don't have time to be picky about our methods. But be honest. You're having a hard time adjusting to your new role, aren't you?
Byleth: I'm not well pleased.
Claude: I understand. You're having a hard time adjusting to your new role, aren't you? You weren't even a follower of Seiros to being with, and somehow you've ended up as a representative of the church.
Claude: I realize that you might feel guilty about deceiving the believers for our cause...


Shamir: I have news. Our enemy is gathering troops at Fort Merceus. Their army is immense. Likely led by a renowned general. Or perhaps even...
Byleth: Edelgard?
Claude: Well now, that would be interesting. If we can defeat the emperor, then the Empire will collapse.
Byleth: The Flame Emperor?
Claude: Perhaps. But she's more than that now. She's the actual emperor. If we can defeat her, the Empire will collapse.
Judith: There's something else. An unidentified army has approached the Great Bridge of Myrddin. They passed through the Daphnel and Gloucester territories from the northwest with incredible speed. They're raising the banner of House Blaiddyd. Perhaps they are the remnants of the Faerghus royal family. From what we could tell, they posed no threat to the citizens of the Alliance, and so we refrained from engaging them in needless combat.
Claude: Maybe they hope to fight against the Empire to avenge their fallen prince. And what about the bridge itself?
Judith: Obviously we wouldn't let them pass without receiving envoys first. We thought they may try to force their way through. We considered firing warning arrows, but they left immediately, heading east.
Claude: Are they intending to use one of the bridges in Ordelia territory?
Judith: Most likely. But the Imperial army still controls those bridges. I can't imagine what they intend to do in the Empire, even if they do manage to break through...
Claude: I'm reluctant to ease up on our surveillance, but it would be difficult to track them there... For now, let's assume they're just troops belonging to the old Kingdom. In any case, we should proceed with caution. Soon, we'll be entering Empire territory ourselves. If our enemies are going to intercept us with an attack... It will probably be at Gronder Field... How fitting that it was the site of the Battle of the Eagle and Lion five years ago.

@Conversation 
Claude: We secured the win in our first skirmish, but the next battle is a different matter. The Empire will come after us with everything it's got. Even so, the ultimate victory will be ours. And I'm not just saying that! I've made ample preparations to ensure our victory. It's my rule to never leave victory to chance. You can't rely on the protection of the goddess. With your power and my schemes, I should be able to plot a direct course to victory.



Lorenz: House Gloucester has changed it's allegiance and joined the faction that is against the Empire. The Alliance will thus remain united. But thanks to this latest ploy, my father is more suspicious of Claude now than ever. If such a thing is possible. Ordinarily, I might credit his helpful posture towards us to his devout faith in the Church of Seiros. But it is clear to me now that this is nothing more than a shrewd calculation on his part. He is only thinking of his position. We are in the clear for now, but please bear in mind that the Alliance is never an entirely stable union.



Raphael: I gotta say, it's tough to keep the fighting spirit alive when you recognize your enemies on the battlefield.
Raphael: It's like when we were fighting before... I saw Lorenz and wasn't sure what to do with myself. 
Byleth: Everyone gets that feeling. 
Raphael: So you can't avoid it, huh? How did everything get so messed up?
Byleth: You can run away if you want.
Raphael: Hey, come on! Even I know we can't do that!
Raphael: Just because we're fighting someone doesn't mean we gotta hate 'em! That's probably the worst thing about war. Win or lose, I still get a bad taste in my mouth.



Ignatz: Thanks to our victory, I've been able to study the Great Bridge of Myrddin at my leisure. And you know what? It's an astounding structure. So much history there. Imagine how much time and effort it must have taken to build something that big. Over water, no less! I hope that someday it will be opened up to the people of FÃ³dlan - a historical site, rather than a military checkpoint.



Lysithea: I trust you and Claude, but I feel uneasy. If we lose in the next battle, the Empire's army will likely come surging into Alliance territory. If that happens, my parents won't escape unharmed. They've raised their anti-Imperial flag, after all.
Byleth: I won't let that happen.
Lysithea: Thank you, Professor. I'll fight with all I've got too.
Byleth: We can't take back what we've done. 
Lysithea: You're right. I chose my path. I must press on. That's all anyone can do, really.
Lysithea: Speaking with you has eased my mind a bit. Just enough in fact, to put me in the mood for sweets.



Marianne: I've been praying to the goddess for Lorenz... We wouldn't have had to fight like that if things were different. 
Marianne: Um, I heard that some unidentified troops have appeared, but... Apparently they were flying the flag of the Faerghus royal family... Do you think it was Dimitri's ghost? His country was taken before he ever wore the crown. Surely he must regret that...



Hilda: Poor Lorenz. He and I weren't very close, but we were friends.
Hilda: Claude was saying that our next battle might be in Gronder Field. Is that right? Reminds me of the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. But of course, that was a very different time. When it was over, all three class heads complimented each other on their bravery. And then we had a party. But we can never go back to that, can we?



Leonie: We might see Edelgard herself leading the enemy in the next battle. If they're coming out of Fort Merceus, our troops might even clash on Gronder Field. And those other troops on the march - who knows what they'll do, or what side they'll take? Not sure how we're supposed to form a strategy with so many unknowns.
Byleth: Don't worry. I can handle it. 
Leonie: I don't know why you're so confident, but it does somehow make me feel better.
Byleth: As long as you're here, I'll be fine.
Leonie: Hey, how come you only ever flatter me in times like these? What am I supposed to make of that?
Leonie: Anyways, we've come this far. Let's just keep putting one foot in front of the other and see how far we get.



Ferdinand: We captured the Great Bridge of Myrddin, but the fight has only just begun. Enbarr, the Imperial Capital, lies far to the south, beyond Gronder Field. And waiting on the way there is the entire Imperial army, with twice as many troops as us. We had better brace ourselves.



Linhardt: I seem to lack the skills required to grieve for the dead. If someone has passed, even someone dear to me, I could stand about and wail or get on with my life. While I'm at it, that whole idea that we must speak well of the dead? I don't understand that either. If I didn't like them when they were alive, then why pretend to do so when they are no longer here?



Caspar: After we cross the Great Bridge of Myrddin, we'll be in my father's territory. We actually crossed it five years ago for the Battle of Eagle and Lion. Remember? Ugh! This is terrifying! What am I gonna do? I gotta get a grip...
Byleth: Don't worry, I'll arrange for your funeral. 
Caspar: You think we'll meet him on the battlefield and he'll kill me? The front lines cover a long stretch of land, you know! We might not even run into him!
Byleth: I'll pray for your safety.
Caspar: Oh, no no no. You should pray we don't run into him at all! The front lines cover a long stretch of land, you know!

Bernadetta: So the campaign continues, does it? Well, allow me, as a professional recluse with ten years of experience, to volunteer for, um...staying behind. Oh, who am I kidding? The fighting won't stop until we've defeated Edelgard, will it? Or until we lose, I guess. But there's not much use in thinking about that.



Dorothea: The Great Bridge of Myrddin was considerably better fortified than it was five years ago... The bridge was full of soldiers...and they all died.
Dorothea: And Ferdie was there. We killed Ferdie, Professor, he used to be our friend. Do you remember those days?



Petra: Nobles who are changing allegiance, again and again. I do not have understanding for that. How can you trust if treason comes with ease? How can you be calling yourself a noble? I do not have understanding of the reasoning...
Byleth: They're struggling for survival too.
Petra: Surviving is more difficult without trust. There must be...some other goal.
Byleth: For personal gain. 
Petra: Survival has more importance than that. Are they not knowing this?



Felix: So, the boar prince is dead. Decapitated, I hear. I haven't seen the severed head myself. Perhaps he's still alive and leading that army...
Byleth: Would you be able to fight him?
Felix: Don't patronize me. If his head is still attached to his body, I'll remedy that without hesitation.
Byleth: Don't get distracted. 
Felix: You're right. I can't let my emotions take hold.
Felix: Either way, a major battle awaits us. Try not to die. I'll be annoyed if you did.



Ashe: If we defeat the Imperial army at Gronder Field, what will our next objective be? I guess we won't have much choice but to try to take Fort Merceus, on the far side of Gronder Field. It's probably too soon for us to be thinking about that, isn't it? The battle just ahead of us is far from certain.



Sylvain: The timeâs come to fight the Empire, huh? Wow, itâs shaping up to be quite the battle. And Iâve got no problem with that, but that mystery army really worries me. Thereâs no indication if theyâre friend or foe... Who do you think they are, Professor?
Byleth: Remnants of the old Kingdom?
Sylvain: I suppose itâs possible. After all, His Highness is supposedly dead.
Byleth: Dimitri himself?
Sylvain: Heh, not unless he rose from the grave to secure revenge. That would mean... Actually, I have no idea what that would mean.
Sylvain: Well, whoever they are, I hope we can avoid fighting them.



Mercedes: So, we're finally going to set foot in the Empire...I'm starting to get a little nervous.
Mercedes: We already fought Ferdinand at the Great Bridge of Myrddin, but...
Mercedes: I guess there's a good chance we'll be fighting more old friends from here on out.



Annette: Claude seems filled with confidence, but I wonder if everything really will be OK... The Imperial army might be hiding the emperor, and the troops headed south might belong to the old Kingdom. Iâll be honest... Iâm incredibly uneasy about all this. But at this point thereâs...no option but to move forward.



Ingrid: Iâve cut all contact with my family since joining this fight. Were I to see soldiers of the Galatea Family amidst the host flying the royal familyâs banner... I... Well. All chance of reconciliation with my father would end there. I do not know if that is the right path. But, the fact is, Iâve come this far. Thereâs no time for second guessing. Not anymore.



Seteth: Each time we press forward, our search for Rhea broadens to a wider area. I certainly hope we will find at least some clue, but I do suspect I already know where she is. If I am right, and she is in the Imperial capital, then we cannot save her until we topple the Empire.



Flayn: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion. Has it truly been five years since then? Can you recall whether it was before or after I joined your class, Professor?
Byleth: Before.
Flayn: That is not at all the case, Professor. Your memory serves you poorly.
Byleth: After. 
Flayn: I'm glad you have not forgotten.
Flayn: It was shortly after I joined your class - I remember it like it was yesterday.



Hanneman: When undertaking research, the usual methods is to form a hypothesis, then test it with experiments. Those experiments reveal facts and falsehoods, yet sometimes, they also unveil an exception. You seem to be that exception when it comes to my Crest research.
Byleth: Sorry about that. 
Byleth: I don't understand.
Hanneman: Worry not, Professor. Exceptions are what make my work interesting. Why don't the rules apply to you? I will find our eventually. I feel it is my destiny as a Crest scholar!



Manuela: I hear the next battle could be a big one, is that true? I miss the old days when, if someone got hurt, we'd rush them to the infirmary, and make them well... But on the battlefield, there's not enough time to help. People die. Professor, don't be one of those!



Alois: Word just reached me that the Empire has stationed soldiers in Fort Merceus. If they decide to dig in their heels and defend the fort, we'll be in a difficult situation. I hear it's an impregnable keep, surrounded by high ramparts. Taking it would not be easy.



Catherine: Beyond the Great Bridge of Myrddin, it's all unfamiliar territory for us. We don't know where Lady Rhea is being held. We ought to investigate all potential locations thoroughly. The Knights of Seiros will handle the search. We'll report back if we learn anything.



Shamir: Reconnaissance is becoming more of a risk the deeper we move into enemy territory. If I don't come back, assume I'm dead.
Byleth: I know you won't get caught.
Shamir: I'm glad you think so highly of me, but we have to be realistic.
Byleth: Understood. 
Shamir: Good. We have to be realistic.
Shamir: Don't waste your energy worrying about me.



Cyril: I gotta keep this place clean, and I mean properly clean, every day. Dust it, sweep it, everything. You never can tell when Lady Rhea might be back.



Judith: Since little Claude became their leader, the Alliance lords haven't been especially unified. Now, they're suddenly united for a common cause. As a result, the Empire hasn't been able to perform even one successful incursion... Rather, we're the ones who might get the jump on them. It's incredible. Magical, even. Maybe his strategic genius was simmering for those five years, and it returned to a full boil once you two were reunited. Or maybe he always knew he'd meet you again, and he was preparing for that this whole time...



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! I hear we're sending troops to Gronder Field next. Is that what's what? That whole area is in the territory of House Bergliez. It's famous as the main granary of FÃ³dlan. If we could capture it, we probably wouldn't have to worry about food anymore! Bread for all!

@Intro 
Hilda: Gronder Field should be around here, right? But it's so foggy... Even if there were enemies here, we'd never know it.
Lysithea: I recall the terrain from the Battle of the Eagle and Lion, but without the ability to see the enemy's formation...
Claude: Our enemies are subject to the same conditions. We'll just have to wait for the fog to clear up.
Judith: Speaking of enemies, what do you think became of those unidentified troops? Any follow-up reports?
Claude: We haven't heard anything since. If they were headed this way... Well, I'd like to avoid being caught by surprise, but we can't make use of our scouts because of this fog. It's hard to predict this fight. There's no way to know what will happen.
Byleth: I'm worried.
Claude: We did everything we could to prepare. If we lose despite that, then we'll just have to accept it as fate and retreat.
Byleth: Let's try to stay calm. 
Claude: Of course. The morale of our allies would be crushed if we let them see us shaking in our boots.
Claude: Your guidance is going to be crucial, Teach. Now more than ever. Do whatever it takes to lead us to victory.

@Opening 
Departing from the Great Bridge of Myrddin, the Alliance army marches south towards Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. An unknown military force begins their advance under the banner of the Kingdom, the Imperial army dispatches forces from Fort Merceus with the intention of interrupting them. The curtain is rising on a conflict between the three armies, which will come to be known as the Battle at Gronder, held on the same plains that witnessed the Battle of the Eagle and Lion.

At Gronder Field, where the Battle of the Eagle and Lion was once held, the house leaders of five years ago have a fateful reunion...but this time, the contest between the Empire, the Kingdom, and the Alliance is no mock battle.

@Battle 
Dimitri: I will crush anyone who blocks my path.
Claude: Dimitri... He's alive. But he doesn't look interested in joining forces with us.
Edelgard: It would not be advantageous to take on both at once. We must stop the Kingdom and the Alliance from joining forces. I will create such chaotic warfare that they won't be able to tell who is friend and who is foe.


Edelgard: Mounted units, advance!



Imperial General: There are enemies in the central area... We need to head there immediately to protect it!

Petra: The center is in danger of being taken. We must be running to protect it!

Dimitri: The Imperial army is starting to crumble. We will step on the Empire right along with the Alliance troops. To the eternal flames with all of them!


Hubert: How kind of our enemies to fight one another. And open flanks as well? Generous.
Dimitri: If they're going to stand in our way, they must die. Smash them to pieces! It is time. Someone, take the central hill!

Edelgard: Those fools who went up the hill will pay with their lives... in the crimson flames!


Edelgard: This is not as I planned, but there's nothing to be done. Burn the central hill!


Hubert: The central hill is up in smoke. Suppose I'll have to quench the flames - with the enemy's blood.


Claude: Even in an ugly battle like this, it's important not to lose heart. We have to take pride in our victory. We did it, Teach. Now we can move forward. To our victory!

@Boss 
Felix: Want to die? Step forward. I'll take you all.

Felix: Not here... Not like this...
Dimitri: Felix...

Ingrid: We all choose our paths and I've chosen mine. I fight for my lord, to the death!

Ingrid: Your Highness... I... failed you...
Dimitri: Ingrid...

Sylvain: Huh. I guess this is fate. Sorry, but I need you to please give up quietly, OK?

Sylvain: Heh, I'm not afraid... I figured it would end like this.
Dimitri: ...

Mercedes: Oh! I haven't seen you in so long! It's such a shame we have to meet like this...

Mercedes: I'm... I'm sorry, Dimitri... I can't seem to stay... on my feet.
Dimitri: Hmph...

Dedue: In the name of High Highness, you die here.

Dedue: I... can still fight, Your Highness.
Dimitri: Shut up and retreat. You must live, Dedue.

Dimitri: Are you trying to stop me too? Then I'll just have to kill you!

Dimitri: You're not worth it. Get out of my sight.

Dimitri: Where are you, Edelgard?! I will not stop until I kill you!

%Claude,Dimitri
Claude: Calm down, Dimitri! What does it achieve, us killing each other here?
Dimitri: Move, Claude. I have no time to exchange words with you.
Claude: It doesn't matter what I'm saying, does it? You aren't even listening. But I'm not gonna budge.

@End 
Claude: So... Edelgard retreated. I suppose she lives to be defeated another day.
Byleth: That's fine.
Claude: I suppose a win is a win, regardless of the circumstances.
Byleth: It was close.
Claude: Too close. But I suppose all that matters is that we won.
Claude: Some of our allies are injured, but can still fight. We'll just have to accept this outcome and press onward. Still, the battlefield looks awful. And I wonder what became of the Kingdom army. And Dimitri...

Hilda: I saw him.
Claude: Who? Dimitri?
Hilda: He was completely different from how I remember him. He looked like a crazed demon while he was fighting. He pursued Edelgard as she retreated, but he didn't get far before he collapsed. I saw him surrounded by Imperial troops and... pierced by their spears. I'll never forget it. He deserved a better end.
Claude: Dimitri... He went through so much to make it here, only for his efforts to be in vain.
Hilda: I can't even begin to understand what Dimitri must have been feeling, but... There must have been some other way. Why did he have to go like that?
Claude: And his vassal, Dedue... Did he fall as well?
Hilda: I don't know...

Dedue: Your Highness! Your ambitions are my own now! I... I will bring you Edelgard's head... I swear it!

Lysithea: Professor? Claude? May I have a moment of your time?
Claude: Lysithea, what are you doing up this late? Trouble sleeping?
Byleth: That's understandable.
Byleth: We all have nights like that.
Claude: Anyone would be shaken after such a brutal battle. If you're having trouble sleeping, you should drink some warm milk. That's a thing, right?
Lysithea: Must you treat me like a child, simply because I am awake a bit later than usual? Actually, I can hardly muster any indignation right now. I wanted to tell you that I noticed something odd during that battle.
Claude: What was it?
Lysithea: There were some strange mages among the ranks of the Imperial army. Did you notice them?
Byleth: The ones wearing masks?
Byleth: The ones dressed in black?
Lysithea: That's right. I have seen people dressed just like that before. It was a long time ago... House Ordelia was involved in a rebellion that took place within the Empire 18 years ago. After it was quelled, all of the key officials were caught and put to death. The Empire sent replacements, who they used to take control of House Ordelia. Among the people sent by the Empire were mages dressed in black, just like those we saw in battle.
Claude: If they're Imperial mages, it would make sense that they would wear the same clothing, right?
Lysithea: Yes, but the mages from back then and today... I do not believe they are from the Adrestian Empire.
Byleth: Are they Kingdom mages?
Byleth: Are they Alliance mages?
Lysithea: No. I got the impression that they were from somewhere else. Somewhere completely separate from FÃ³dlan. There's more. Those mages imprisoned the children from my house, and performed horrible rituals on them. Blood experiments.
Claude: Lysithea... You can't mean... even you?
Lysithea: Yes. All of the others were deemed failures. They all died. And even I... It doesn't matter. The point is, that those monsters possess dreadful knowledge and power. I just thought you should know the sort of people who have allied with the Empire.
Claude: Blood experiments... Does that remind you of anything, Teach?
Byleth: The incident with Flayn...
Byleth: That incident with the Flame Emperor...
Claude: Exactly. There was that secret group who abducted Flayn and extracted her blood five years ago. The people involved back then were Tomas and Monica... Well, I suppose their true names were Solon and Kronya. So that eerie group has been slithering behind the scenes in the Empire for a while now... Lysithea... Thank you for sharing all of that with us. One day we will uncover the truth of who those people really are.

Claude: We've managed to invade Empire territory and emerge victorious in our first battle. I hope to maintain our momentum and push onward to Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Unfortunately, we are not legendary heroes in a fairytale. Our stamina has limits. The longer we fight, the harder the fight will become. It will take immense effort to secure the supplies and soldier we need to prevail.
Judith: Boy, you better not be saying this is as far as we go.
Claude: Of course not. However, the road ahead leads deep into enemy territory. It will be a difficult journey, strewn with hardship. I can't guarantee that we'll make it out alive. If anyone wants to leave, now is the time to do it.
Lorenz: I shall accompany you to the very end. After all, someone must step up to take leadership should you fall.
Leonie: I'm coming. The future of my village depends on this. Besides... I have to protect the professor. For Captain Jeralt.
Raphael: I'm not going anywhere! Because of the Empire, my little sis can't live in peace!
Ignatz: We can't leave the future of FÃ³dlan to others. I'm sure that everyone here feels the same.

Alois: The Knights of Seiros will keep fighting the Empire. We won't rest until we rescue Lady Rhea.
Cyril: I feel the same as the knights. I've gotta rescue Lady Rhea no matter what.
Hilda: So, what - we're all supposed to take turns saying we'll do our best until the very end? And what about you, Marianne? What will you do?
Marianne: I... I'll fight too!
Hilda: Fine, fine. I suppose I'll tag along too... Until the bitter end.
Claude: It's an honor to keep fighting alongside such stalwart allies. Right, Teach?
Byleth: I'd expect nothing less from my students.
Claude: Hey now, when you put it that way, it almost sounds like you're just praising yourself!
Byleth: You're a stalwart ally too, Claude.
Claude: I know I'm a great leader and all, but praising me isn't gonna get you anywhere.
Claude: All right. Now that I know where each of you stands, I'm going to return to Alliance territory for a while. I intend to report this victory to Alliance lords and draw out even more support from them. Our next battle will be even more challenging, so brace yourselves for that.
Hilda: Hmm... I should write to my brother. He'll want to hear about our victory.
Claude: Your brother, Lord Holst? How is he these days?
Hilda: Oh, he's doing great. I even got a letter from him before the last battle. He wanted to come and join our fight too.
Lorenz: What's this? Lord Holst, come here? That would be a most reassuring development.
Hilda: Sadly, it sounds like my father was against the idea. They wanted him to stay in case they need to fight the Almyrans.
Lorenz: Their logic is sound. Though it is vexing that the Alliance's greatest general cannot join us on the front lines.
Claude: We should be glad that Holst is staying behind. Almyra aside, there's also no guarantee that the Imperial forces won't try to launch a surprise attack from the old Kingdom territory.
Hilda: Um... If you have something you need to talk to my brother about, I'd be happy to send a letter.
Claude: No, that's OK. I'm just glad to hear he's doing well. Please send him my regards.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
The icy winds of the Oghma Mountains have begun to scatter, and the verdant fields once again spring to life across FÃ³dlan, heralding the start of a new year. As they celebrate the dawning year, the people pray that they may realize their full potential, just as a tiny sprout hopes to one day grow into a great tree.

The continent of FÃ³dlan, said to be protected by a revered goddess, has existed since time immemorial. Three ruling powers now control the land. In the south lies a region long held by a more than one-thousand-year-old dynastyâthe Adrestian Empire. Beyond its borders, to the frigid north, is the home of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, ruled by the royal family and its knights. To the east, a league of nobles that heeds no king nor emperor rules what is called the Leicester Alliance. Once consumed by a tempest of war and turmoil, FÃ³dlan and these three mighty powers now exist in relative harmony.

@Cutscene 
Dimitri: This will be your first time at the monastery. Iâd be happy to show you around.
Claude: It really is FÃ³dlan in a nutshell. The good and the bad.
Edelgard: Like it or not, weâll be there soon enough.

Edelgard: There it is. Garreg Mach Monastery.

Jeralt: Rhea's here.

Rhea: I wonder... Did the flow of time bring you here?

@Dialogue 
Jeralt: It's been years since I've last set eyes on this place. To be forced to see her now...
Byleth: Her?
Jeralt: You saw her in the courtyard earlier, didn't you? The archbishop...Lady Rhea.
Byleth: You've been here before?
Jeralt: I've never spoken of this to you before, but...many years ago, I was a knight here. I reported to the archbishop...Lady Rhea.
Byleth: The archbishop?
Byleth: Lady Rhea?
Jeralt: As you know, the majority of folks in FÃ³dlan are devout followers of the teachings of Seiros. The leader of that ridiculously large religious organization is the archbishop, Lady Rhea.

Seteth: Thank you for your patience, Jeralt. My name is Seteth. I am an advisor to the archbishop.
Jeralt: Right. Hello.
Rhea: It has been a long time, Jeralt. I wonder...was it the will of the goddess that we have another chance meeting like this?
Jeralt: Forgive my silence all these years. Much has happened since we last spoke.
Rhea: So I see. The miracle of fatherhood has blessed you. That is your child, is it not?
Jeralt: Yes...born many years after I left this place. I wish I could introduce you to the mother of my child...but Iâm afraid we lost her to illness.
Rhea: I see. My condolences. As for you...I heard of your valiant efforts from Alois. What is your name?

Byleth: My name is... 
Rhea: A fine name indeed.
Byleth: ...
Seteth: You must at least show the basic courtesy of telling us your name! Do you not think you are being a bit rude to the archbishop?
Rhea: It is all right, Seteth. My dear, I am called Rhea. I am the archbishop of the Church of Seiros. In truth, I was only being polite. I already know your name. And a fine name it is.
Rhea: From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for saving those students of the Officers Academy.
Jeralt: Hmph.
Rhea: Jeralt. You already know what it is I wish to say, do you not?
Jeralt: You want me to rejoin the Knights of Seiros, donât you. I wonât say no, but...
Rhea: Your apprehension stings. I had expected that Alois would have already asked this of you. I must step away for now, but I expect they will desire a word with you soon. Please listen carefully to what they have to say. Until tomorrow... Farewell.

@Dialogue 
Jeralt: I canât believe it. Forced back into the Knights of Seiros. Iâm sorry I dragged you into this. Looks like Iâll be stuck here for a while...and Iâm afraid your services are requested as well.
 
Byleth: As a mercenary?
Byleth: As a servant?
Jeralt: Nothing like that. They want you to teach, by the sound of it. You heard those brats earlier talking about the Officers Academy, right? Well, the academy just happens to be short a professor. And apparently that damned Alois went and recommended you to Lady Rhea.

Manuela: So. You must be the new professor. My, how stern and handsome you are!
Jeralt: Er, no. Iâm not the one youâre looking for. You can handle things from here. Good luck.  And...watch out for Lady Rhea. I donât know what sheâs thinking, making you a professor like this. She may be up to something. Stay on your guard.

Manuela: Oh. It's you, then? So young...
Hanneman: Competence and age are not necessarily correlated, as you well know. I am Hanneman, a Crest scholar and professor at the Officers Academy. I wonder if you bear a Crest of your own. When next you have a moment to spare, I insist that you pay me a visit so we can delve into the subject further.
Manuela: Iâm Manuela. Iâm a professor, a physician, a songstress, and available. Itâs nice to meet you.

Byleth: You're a physician?
Manuela: I look too pretty for that line of work, do I? But yes, when Iâm not teaching, I can be found in the infirmary. If youâre ever lonely, please do come and pay me a visit. I would love toâ
Byleth: "You're a songstress?" 
Manuela: Of course. Before I came here, I belonged to a renowned opera company. Perhaps you've heard of me? The Mittelfrank Opera Company's beautiful, peerlessâ
Hanneman: Spare our colleague the needless chatter, Manuela. Now then, it seems youâll be taking charge of one of the academyâs three houses. I expect you havenât yet been briefed on the nature of each, have you?
Manuela: Do you really not know? Fine, Iâll do you a favor and explain. The Officers Academy is comprised of three houses of students, each of which is closely affiliated with its region of origin. The Black Eagle House is for students from the Adrestian Empire. Their house leader this year is Edelgard, the Imperial princess, who is in line to be the next emperor.
Hanneman: The Blue Lion House is for students from the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus. Their house leader this year is Prince Dimitri. He is to be the next king of Faerghus.
Manuela: Lastly, there is the Golden Deer House, which is for students of the Leicester Alliance. Their house leader is Claude, grandson to Duke Riegan, the leader of the Alliance.
Hanneman: To think that the next emperor, king and sovereign duke are all here. It certainly is a promising year for the academy.
Manuela: Iâll say. I just hope none of those little treasures cause any trouble.
Hanneman: Hm, quite. For now, I suggest taking a stroll around the academy to get your bearings. And when youâve a moment, please stop by my research laboratory.
Manuela: The old man has a point. Oh, and keep in mind that Iâve only notified the house leaders that youâre our new professor. Itâs more fun that way. I suggest you try spending time with the students. Some odd ducks in that bunch, but theyâre good kids. Iâm sure Lady Rhea will have more information for you tomorrow, but that should get you going. Good luck. Youâll need it.

Seteth: Have you no intention of changing your mind, Rhea? Appointing a strangerâa child no less!âas a professor at our esteemed academy isâ
Rhea: I have made my decision, Seteth. I know worrying comes naturally to you, but there is truly no need. That âstrangerâ is Jeraltâs flesh and blood, after all.
Seteth: I canât say thatâs all too comforting. How trustworthy is this Jeralt character? Is he not the man who went missing after the great fire 21 years ago? I would remind you that Flayn is now here with us as well. I beg of you...please consider whether this is an unnecessary risk.
Rhea: Seteth. They have my trust. Let that be enough for you as well. More importantly, I have received a report from Shamir. I am increasingly concerned about a matter regarding our suspicious individual. We cannot ignore those who harbor ill will towards the church, especially if they are frequenting Garreg Mach.
Seteth: Yes, that matter is of great importance as well. I shall continue my investigation. Rhea... For now, I will have faith that you are placing your trust with the utmost care. I pray that nothing occurs to shake that confidence.

@Conversation
Rhea: I assume you are already aware that you will be teaching here at the Officers Academy. Correct? To start, please speak with the three house leaders. You should also take a look around the academy and acquaint yourself with your new home. That is your first task here at the monastery. Please let me know if you accept it. Once you have finished, come and speak with me.

Rhea: You should speak with every student you can. This might be your only chance to see what they're really like before you become a professor...
Rhea:  You are responsible for choosing which house to lead. If there are still students you have yet to speak with, try visiting each house's homeroom.

Alois: Ha! I imagine you were a bit surprised that I recommended you as a professor here. Frankly, we had someone else in mind for the role, but they ran off during our dustup with the bandits. Can't entrust students to someone who's abandoned them once before, huh?

Seteth: You saved the lives of the students you came across. That, at least, was admirable. Now, you should make the rounds. Go around the monastery and see that you greet everyone.

Edelgard: So you've accepted a teaching position here... Pity. I was hoping you would lend your strength to the Empire. I never properly introduced myself, did I? My name is Edelgard von Hresvelg. I am the princess and heir apparent to the Adrestian Empire. I wonder if you'll be tasked with leading the Black Eagles... I hope you've had a chance to meet everyone. Would you like to know more about any of the Black Eagles?
Byleth: Yes.
Edelgard: Me? Well...some think I'm a bit distant. Arrogant, even. But there's little to be done. One day, I must rise to become Adrestia's next emperor. What else... Well, it seems to me that we may have similar personalities.
Edelgard: Hubert is the heir of Marquis Vestra. He has served me since I was a child. You may think his blood runs a bit cold, but... Heh, actually, that's rather accurate. Still, if you can get past that, you'll see he's quite astute and reasonable.
Edelgard: For some reason, he thinks of me as a bitter rival and is always trying to challenge me. It's terribly irritating. His house is that of Duke Aegir, which produces Adrestia's Prime Ministers. That family is...perhaps too pleased with its own status.
Edelgard: He's remarkably intelligent, but he only wishes to apply himself to tasks that particularly interest him and nothing else. He's also fond of...well, napping. If he had any work ethic or sense of duty to speak of, I suppose he would be destined to become an official of the Empire.
Edelgard: He's the second son of Count Bergliez. He has no inheritance in his future, which is perhaps why he's always so eager to prove himself. He's overly energetic and rushes headfirst into any battle. If he ends up in your care, be sure to keep a close eye on him.
Edelgard: She's Count Varley's only daughter. I suppose you could say she's a bit eccentric, but she seems like a gentle soul. I believe she's shut herself away in her quarters and doesn't care to leave, but...don't worry. I'll make sure she finds her way to class.
Edelgard: Few commoners have joined the Black Eagle House, but Dorothea is an exception. She's a songstress from a famous opera company in the Empire. I'm not entirely sure what brought her to the Officers Academy.
Edelgard: To the west of FÃ³dlan is an archipelago called Brigid. Petra is the granddaughter of their king. Brigid is a vassal state of the Empire, which is how she came to be enrolled here. She's incredibly smart and studious.

Dimitri: Please accept my apologies for the other day. You came to our aid, yet I hadn't even the courtesy to properly introduce myself. I am Dimitri Alexandre Blaiddyd, crown prince of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus. Of course, at the academy I am simply a student. And I've heard word that you are to become a professor here. Delightful news. I still have much to learn, but I'm confident I could benefit greatly from your guidance. In any case, welcome to the monastery. I hear you're investigating the different houses. Did any of the Blue Lions catch your attention?
Byleth: Yes. 
Dimitri: Me? Oh. Um. Please forgive me... It's difficult to open up on the spot, don't you think? I'm afraid my story has not been a pleasant one... I do hope that doesn't color your view of me, but I understand if that can't be helped.
Dimitri: Dedue was born in Duscur, and has been loyally working in my service for the past four years. He's rather taciturn, but once you get to know him, you'll see he's a kind and good-natured young man.
Dimitri: Felix is the heir to House Fraldarius. He has a bit of a sharp tongue, but don't let that fool you. Deep down, he's a good guy. He gravitates towards people who are skilled. Perhaps you would enjoy a friendly competition with him sometime.
Dimitri: He's the adoptive son of Lord Lonato of Castle Gaspard, but I hear he was born a commoner. He has an extremely earnest personality, so I'm certain he will approach your lectures with great enthusiasm.
Dimitri: Sylvain is the heir to House Gautier. He is a capable person who highly values his friends. That said... Well, he's always been a bit of a...ahem, skirt chaser, so to speak. Pardon my bluntness. I speak with him about it often, but it doesn't seem to help.
Dimitri: I hear she was born to Imperial nobility, but a twist of fate brought her to the Kingdom. She may seem carefree on the surface, but she's actually a kind soul who pays careful attention to everyone around her.
Dimitri: Annette is Baron Dominic's niece. She is a talented student who scored extremely high marks at the Royal School of Sorcery. She's cheerful and hardworking. Brilliant, really. Though she can be a bit oblivious at times. I hear she caused an explosion in the kitchen last night...
Dimitri: Ingrid is Count Galatea's daughter. She is also a childhood friend of Felix, Sylvain and myself. She is diligent, industrious, and principled. In truth, she is more knightly than most knights you will ever meet.

Claude: Well, well. Scored a teaching gig here, did ya? Talk about a great first impression. I guess that means I'd better introduce myself properly. I'm Claude von Riegan. I'm from the ruling house of the Leicester Alliance, but don't worry too much about all that madness. I'm guessing you don't know which class you'll be teaching yet, do you? I bet you'd like ours. We're not as...difficult as the other two. Have you met the folks from the Golden Deer House yet? Care to know more about anyone?
Byleth: Yes. 
Claude: (laughs) Piqued your interest, have I? As luck would have it, I'm pretty curious about you as well. But what's life without a bit of mystery? Let's just spend the next year or so learning about each other, little by little.
Claude: He's the heir of Gloucester territory. If you haven't already picked up on it, he's a bit arrogant and fancies himself a lady's man. That said, deep down he's really devoted and honest... Though I wouldn't mind never hearing him talk about his noble obligations ever again.
Claude: He comes from a merchant family, but his parents died in an accident. Seems like he's had a rough life. Despite all that, he's just about the most cheerful guy you'll ever meet. His passions are training, eating, and... Actually, that's about it.
Claude: He's the second son of a merchant family. Since his brother will inherit the business, he's training to become a knight. If you ask me, doesn't seem like he truly wants to be a knight... He's probably just doing it to please his parents...
Claude: Lysithea is the daughter of Count Ordelia, and is probably the youngest student here. But watch out! She gets angry if you treat her like a child. As for me, I do it on purpose. You have to make your own fun in this place, you know?
Claude: Marianne is Margrave Edmund's daughter...and that's pretty much all I know about her. She doesn't interact much with other students, so I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of folks here have never even heard her speak.
Claude: Hilda is the only daughter of Duke Goneril. It seems her father and brother coddle her quite a bit. If you look up "lazy" in the dictionary...her picture won't be there because she never got around to submitting it. Not too unusual for a noble, I guess.
Claude: Leonie enrolled because she wants to be a mercenary. I think she said that her father is a hunter. She's pretty blunt and as stingy as they come. A habitual saver, too. I think she's hoping to repay her village for helping to send her here.

@Dialogue 
Byleth: (I suppose I should return to Rhea...)

@Conversation 
Student: This is the classroom of the Black Eagle House, which is for students from the Adrestian Empire. Our house leader is Princess Edelgard. There are many other nobles among our ranks as well.

Hubert: I am Hubert. A humble servant of Lady Edelgard. I heard you came to the aid of Her Highness. You have my most sincere thanks. This is Petra. She has come all the way from Brigid to study in the Empire. Back on her archipelago, she is actually a princess. In FÃ³dlan terms, she would be called heir to the throne.
Petra: Hello. I am called Petra. I am pleased to be meeting with-- No, I am pleased to have met you.

Caspar: Is it true that you saved Edelgard? That's incredible! The name's Caspar, by the way. Pleased to meet ya!
Linhardt: Linhardt. Good-bye.
Caspar: Yeesh, Linhardt. How'd you get into the academy with those manners? So, are you a student here too? Maybe we'll be in the same class!

Bernadetta: Ah! What?! I don't talk to strangers!
Ferdinand: Bernadetta, this is no stranger! Our house leader owes this person a great debt. Is that not right? (To Byleth) I am Ferdinand von Aegir, legitimate son of the Aegir family, the Empire's foremost house. Are you going to join our class? I look forward to getting better acquainted with you.

Dorothea: Well, aren't you just lovely. Is this your first time in the monastery? Shall I show you around? Oh, my name is Dorothea. Before I joined the academy, I was a member of an opera company in the Empire. You should hear me sing sometime.

Student: This classroom belongs to the Blue Lion House. Our house leader is Prince Dimitri. All of us here hail from the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus.

Sylvain: Well, well! It must be my lucky day today, being approached by such a beauty. I'm Sylvain Jose Gautier. Feel free to say hi whenever you like.

Mercedes: And who's this? You don't look familiar at all. Do you work here at the monastery?
Annette: Oh, Mercie! Do you think this is that mercenary people have been talking about?
Mercedes: Now that I think about it, that does sound like something Dimitri may have said... I suppose you'll be enrolling at the Officers Academy too, then? Well, it's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Mercedes, and this is my best friendâ
Annette: I'm Annette! It's nice to meet you.

Ingrid: I have heard all about what you did from Prince Dimitri. As a citizen of Faerghus, I thank you.
Felix: He also said you're quite skilled. And he doesn't just say things like that. I look forward to sparring with you and beating you.
Ingrid: Felix, must you always speak of fighting right away? Oh! And, uh...you may call me Ingrid. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

Ashe: Hi, there! You must be the one everyone's talking about. I'm Ashe. Great to meet you. This here is Dedue. He serves Prince Dimitri.
Dedue: I have heard that you rescued His Highness. Words cannot express my gratitude. Should you ever require my strength, please know that I will hasten to repay this debt.

Student: The Golden Deer House is for students of the Leicester Alliance. Our house leader is heir to the Alliance's leadership, House Riegan. We have plenty of other prominent nobles as well!

Raphael: Are you someone's guest? The dining hall's that way if that's what you're looking for.
Leonie: No, Raphael. That's Captain Jeralt's kid. Hi, I'm Leonie PinelliâCaptain Jeralt's first and greatest apprentice! I'm sure he's told you about me?
Raphael: Nice to meet you! I'm Raphael Kirsten. Who are you again?

Hilda: Hey, are you that mercenary? Everyone's been talking about you. I'm Hilda Valentine Goneril. And her name is...
Marianne: M-Marianne von Edmund...
Hilda: Are you joining the Knights of Seiros or something? Well, I look forward to seeing more of you!

Lysithea: So you're the skilled mercenary who saved Claude, are you?
Ignatz: Oh, you are? It's such an honor to meet you! Ignatz Victor. My parents are Alliance merchants.
Lysithea: And I am Lysithea von Ordelia. Please do not forget it.

Lorenz: Ah. You must be the renowned mercenary who rescued Claude. Honestly, you should not have troubled yourself over the likes of him. My name is Lorenz Hellman Gloucester. You will want to remember it.

Jeritza:  What do you want?  I am Jeritza. I teach here. Weapon instruction. These are the training grounds. Good-bye.

Gatekeeper:  Greetings! You must be the new professor. What a pleasure!  As for me, my job is to stand here at this glorious entrance and leisurely watch over the comings and goings of everyone. Make folks smile, you know?  Er...and by that, I mean...to vigilantly guard this entrance with my very life! No levity whatsoever. As of now, nothing to report.

Jeralt: Here I am again, the office of the captain of the knights. That said, I'm merely here to assist. Apparently the current captain is getting on in years. I hear the captain has a hard time keeping up with the responsibilities of the job.  That's where I come in.

Hanneman: This is my research laboratory. I've worked hard to furnish it with the rare materials and purpose-built equipment required for my work.

Manuela: Oh, Professor! Dropping by so soon? I expected we'd take some time. Exchange a few smiles as we passed in the hall, flirt a bit, you know... Well, you're here now, and I do like a man who knows what he wants. Lock the door. Huh. That welcome didn't faze you at all, did it? What's the matter? Don't you like me? Or...are you just so innocent you don't understand me?

Cyril: I'm real busy, so could you please move along now? Thanks. OK now, what else did Lady Rhea need doing today?

Tomas:  Welcome to the library. Here you may find literature from the far reaches of FÃ³dlan.  I am Tomas, the librarian. If you have need of me, do not hesitate to ask. I have worked here for...hm. I have lost track of the decades, it seems.

@Dialogue 
Rhea: How are you enjoying your time at the academy thus far? I hope you have found our halls brimming with the vitality of well-intentioned souls.
Seteth: Hm. I suppose it is time for you to take charge of one of our three houses of students. I must note that I am personally against entrusting someone as lacking in trackable history as yourself with such a task, but it is as the archbishop desires.
Manuela: The Black Eagles, the Blue Lions, and the Golden Deer... All so different. I hope youâve made it a point to get to know each of them.
Hanneman: Since you are new here, we have decided to allow you first pick. Manuela and I will take charge of the remaining two houses.
Byleth: (Which house will I choose...)
Rhea: Are you having trouble deciding? Please, open your heart to the will of the goddess and choose carefully.

^start 
Rhea: So, you have chosen the Black Eagles, led by Edelgard, correct?

Rhea: So, you have chosen the Blue Lions, led by Dimitri, correct?

Rhea: So, you have chosen the Golden Deer, led by Claude, correct?
^end

Rhea: Your heart has made its choice, then. All I ask is that you guide these open minds with virtue, care, and sincerity.
Seteth: They are all promising youths who bear the weight of FÃ³dlanâs future upon their shoulders. I hope you appreciate what an honor it is to lead them.
Flayn: Brother? Oh! I am so sincerely sorry! I did not mean to interrupt.
Seteth: I am in the middle of something, Flayn. Is it urgent?
Flayn: No, no, itâs nothing. More importantly... Who is this?
Seteth: This is our newest professor at the academy.
Flayn: Oh my! A new addition to the Officers Academy! I am so very pleased to meet you, Professor. I am Setethâs little sister, Flayn. I am so happy to make your acquaintance.
Seteth: Let us focus on the topic at hand. There is something you should be aware of. In a few daysâ time, there will be a mock battle between the three houses, intended to gauge the current progress of the students. We will be using this battle as an opportunity to ascertain your own abilities as well. Please do not disappoint the archbishop. That is all.

@Dialogue 
^start
Caspar: Wait. So our new professor is...you?! I didn't see that one coming.
Dorothea: Easy, Caspar. Aren't you being a bit rude?
Linhardt: You know it's a waste of time to expect politeness from him.  It will be a pleasure learning from you, Professor. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to take a nap. 
Bernadetta: Ah! Don't look at me like that! Oh, and...please don't talk to me too much either.
Dorothea:  I'm sorry for the chaos you've walked into...
Ferdinand: I hear we are rather close in age, Professor. I hope you do not mind if we treat you like one of us. In our class, we try to treat each other as equals, despite any differences in age or status. Personally, I would love to include you in that inner circle.
Byleth: I don't mind at all.
Petra: You have a gut, Professor. I will take great joy from your teachings.
Dorothea: Petra, I believe you mean to say that our professor has guts. That's a bit different from having a gut. You can't go around saying someone so slim and attractive has a gut!
Petra: Oh! Please take my apologies. I have not yet mastered this language.
Edelgard: Professor, I want you to know that it's perfectly acceptable for you to treat me as you do the others. I may be the Imperial Princess, but here at the academy, I'm just another student. That said, know that I have high expectations of you. And high hopes. But I'm certain you can lead the Black Eagle House to greatness.
Caspar: Sure, sure. Now, let's break the ice with a training session! I want to see our new teacher in action.
Petra: Why will the ice be broken? Is this a custom I have missed in my studies?
Caspar: Not real ice, just the ice of...um--- Well, it just means let's get to know each other.
Bernadetta: I don't wanna train! Let's stay in the classroom and...learn from a book.
Dorothea: Let's all calm down and have a nice cup of tea, how about? Doesn't that sound lovely, Professor?
Linhardt: ...
Ferdinand: I know we all agreed to treat each other as equals, but there is a limit to what I can tolerate. The esteemed Black Eagle House requires order.
Hubert:  Looks like your first job will be to quiet down this racket. I don't envy you.
Edelgard: Ugh, they're not normally this...rowdy. I do hope you can manage, Professor.

Annette: Wait, does this mean our new professor is-- No! I really can't believe it! But I was speaking to you so casually, as though we were companions! Oh, I am so sorry, Professor; you just look the same age as the rest of us, and-- Oh, and Iâm sorry I just said that too! I really must watch my tongue...
Byleth: I don't mind if you treat me as a friend.
Annette: You say that, but...I just don't know about all of this.
Dimitri: I'll admit, it doesn't sit well with me either. After all, we wish to show you due respect.
Sylvain: Sure, but if the professor says it OK, shouldnât that be enough? That is, if Your Highness can consent to such a thing. After all, weâre already speaking this way to our future king, so we may as well relax our speech with our professor too, right?
Dimitri: Well, weâre not in the Kingdom, so it only goes to follow that we should all speak companionably.  I concede. If the professor says itâs fine, we ought to accept that kindness gratefully.
Ingrid: As for me, I'm not sure I can manage.
Mercedes: You donât have to force yourself if itâs too difficult. Youâre fine with that too, right, Professor?
Sylvain: Such benevolence is a sight to behold! I don't suppose you would care to join me for tea? We could discuss education...and marriage.
Felix: Control yourself, Sylvain. I have more important matters to discuss with our new professor.
Felix: Having heard of your skills, I'm eager to meet you in battle. Come to the training ground later. There, you will show me what youâre capable of.
Dimitri: You aren't wasting any time, are you, Felix? As it were, count me in for any such battle.
Felix: Hmph.
Ashe: Pardon me, but I would also love to observe you in battle, for future reference. If thatâs OK with you.
Dimitri: Ashe, I donât have you speak of merely watching. You should join us as well.
Mercedes:  If you get injured, simply say the word, and Iâll patch you up straight away!
Dedue: Your Highness, do take care not to go overboard.
Dimitri: You worry too much, Dedue. I'll be fine, I promise.
Sylvain: My companions, is there not something inherently wrong with crossing blades, as a way to bond with each other?
Ingrid: Huh, I never thought of it that way. Well, if thatâs how you feel, I suppose youâll just stay behind while the rest of us are at the training ground?
Sylvain: Ingrid, my dearest friend! You really are too hard on me.
Dimitri: Well then, Professor, what do you think? As you can see, the Blue Lion House is a lively bunch, but youâll fine none who work harder. Iâm certain weâll cause our fair share of trouble, but Iâm very much looking forward to the year ahead.

Hilda: Wait, what?! Are you really our new homeroom professor?
Ignatz: Is that true? You aren't quite what I pictured. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
Hilda: I was sure you'd be roped into joining the knights!
Claude: Don't tell me, you chose this class just to get to know me better, right? I'm flattered, really.  Whoops. Now that you're our professor, maybe I should choose my words more carefully.
Byleth: I don't mind.
Claude: Oh? Well, then. Since we're pretty close in age and all, I suppose formalities aren't all that necessary.
Lorenz: One must truly marvel at the exceptionality of this appointment. Becoming a teacher to students almost the same age as yourself. How...unusual. I've heard you are a skilled mercenary, but I cannot shake my discomfort at your new position.
Raphael: Are you really as strong as they say? Let's see your biceps! I bet I've packed on more muscle than you!
Ignatz: I doubt that. Apparently our new professor was personally recommended by Alois, one of the knights.
Claude: As far as skill goes, I saw it with my own eyes. What's more, Teach here is the child of the most renowned former captain of the Knights of Seiros.
Leonie: I heard. There's no way a child of the captain isn't worthy. It's simply not possible.
Lysithea: "The Captain"? Who are you talking about?
Leonie: Captain Jeralt, of course, the most notable captain of the Knights of Seiros and a peerless mercenary.
Byleth: He's not that well known...
Byleth: You're exaggerating a bit.
Leonie: Hmph! It doesn't matter what you think of him. Captain Jeralt deserves nothing but respect.
Lysithea: Hm. Well, after working as a mercenary alongside a father figure such as he, I have high hopes for our professor.
Hilda: Just because someone is special... doesn't mean their children are special too, Lysithea. Assuming that a child is going to be exceptional just because of their lineage is a bad idea.  Don't you agree, Marianne?
Marianne: Huh? Oh, um, yes, I suppose so.
Leonie: Well, we can find out for ourselves in battle. I can't wait to see what tactics you've learned from the captain.
Raphael: A battle? Shouldn't we have a welcome party or something first? I'll get the meat.
Lorenz: How savage. I propose a nice conversation over tea instead. I am more than willing to procure some high-quality leaves.
Raphael: Tea? You can't get to know someone over tea. If there's no meat involved, it's not a party.
Lorenz: Your common sensibilities are grating to my noble ears. Please quiet yourself.
Claude: Sorry for the bickering, Teach. As you can see, the Golden Deer is a rowdy bunch. We're not especially unified. You'll find nobles and commoners alike here-- those who are dedicated to their studies alongside slackers. But hey, that just makes your life more exciting, right? I really hope you're looking forward to the year ahead as much as I am.

@Dialogue 
Hanneman: Say, while you're here...I'd like to use this device I designed to determine whether the power of a Crest resides within you. Won't hurt a bit. Promise. You donât know about Crests? Well, allow me to tell you everythingâabsolutely everythingâabout them. Is your calendar clear? This will take a while. Crests are a fascinating topic, but before one can dive deeply into said topic, one must first understand what Crests are. They are power incarnate. They are said to have been bestowed upon humans by the goddess countless ages ago. They exist within the flesh, and are passed down through bloodlines. Those who carry crests may excel at magic, display exceptional strength, or any number of boons. Each Crest has its own power, the nature of which is beyond mortal understanding. For now.
Byleth: And you believe I have a Crest?
Hanneman: I suspect as much, yes. But we wonât know for sure unless I look into the matter. As I said, Crests are passed down through the blood. However, just because someone carries a Crest does not necessarily mean their descendants will inherit it as well. Only a scarce few descendants of a Crestâs bloodline end up inheriting that Crestâs power. Perhaps one of your ancestors bore a Crest, and you just happened to inherit it. That is how a Crest usually presents itself, after all.
Byleth: Do what you can to find out. 
Hanneman: Yes, of course. I'll get to the bottom of it straight away.
Byleth: There's no need to look into it.
Hanneman: I most strongly disagree! There absolutely is a need. My Crest research is of critical importance to the church, I'll have you know. Since you are now a professor here, I must insist that you aid in my research. Of course...there are those who lack the foresight to aid in my endeavors, such as that stubborn Seteth. But such individuals are the rare exception.
Hanneman: Now then, please go ahead and hold out your arm over this device here.

Hanneman: What is this?! A pattern Iâve never seen before...Is it possible an as-yet undiscovered Crest has been detected? To think there are still Crests out there that even I am unaware of! How thrilling! Ahem... Pardon my unrestrained jubilation. I have much to consider. You may leave now. I have more research to do in regard to this Crest. Yes, so very much more research. But for now, your work here is done.  Hmm... What could this line here be indicating? Perhaps it represents a lack of symmetry... or perhaps... What in the world? Oh, I see... It may be connected to that, but to a greater degree than usual...
Byleth: ...

Rhea: With each moon, professors of the Officers Academy receive a schedule for the month ahead. It notes the days on which events and missions will take place that month. Pay careful attention to your schedule so that you may thoughtfully plan what you intend to do each month, and when.

Byleth: (So, this is my room... I thought I heard a girl's voice...but I must have been imagining things.)

@Conversation 
Edelgard: Some believe the dignity of the Empire rests on the results of the mock battle. That's an overstatement, of course. Still, we must do our best to prevail. You should take the time to learn each student's abilities. Perhaps some extra lessons and training sessions are in order? You look as if you have no idea what's going on here. I know my way around, so I'm happy to help you find your footing.
Edelgard: The monastery has some exceptional facilities that everyone who lives at the Officers Academy is welcome to make use of. For example, you can enjoy a meal with your students at the dining hall or take part in some one-on-one sparring at the training grounds. I suggest visiting the various facilities whenever you have the time to spare. It's a great way to get to know the students, faculty, and various workers here.
Edelgard: Have you noticed the bulletin boards placed around the monastery? Those contain requests people have posted, as well as helpful information from the market. If you prove yourself by helping people with their requests, certain facilities here will become available for your use. The bulletin board is updated frequently, so I suggest checking it at least once a month.
Edelgard: You should take your time when speaking with everyone, but when it comes to using the facilities... Well, you need to be more careful with that. If you use them without planning ahead, your free time will be gone before you know it.
Edelgard: A great deal is expected from professors of the Officers Academy, so it's important to hone your skills. To put it plainly, you'll need to keep expanding your knowledge of all disciplines, not just battle.

Edelgard: I trust you're eager to face the Black Eagles in battle. Enjoy the thrill of anticipation while it lasts. Soon you'll wish you had chosen to lead our house instead.

Dimitri: I hear there will be a mock battle soon. We must not neglect our training. I trust that you will carefully study the strengths and weaknesses of each of your students, that you may provide effective guidance. Regardless of the results, this battle will be a great learning experience. Even so... What is the point of competition if the aim isn't to win? As this is your first time at the monastery, please allow me to show you the ropes.
Dimitri: Both students and teachers of the Officers Academy are free to use the facilities within the monastery. For example, you can dine with others at the dining hall or partake in one-on-one combat in the training grounds. I encourage you to wander around the monastery and lend an ear to the people living here.
Dimitri: There are bulletin boards in various places around the monastery. Have you seen them, Professor? There you can find requests from various sources, as well as information about the market. If you fulfill these requests, you should eventually be able to use even more of the facilities here. The bulletin board gets updated frequently. You would do well to check it once a month.
Dimitri: This probably goes without saying, but no matter which facility you use, it will take up a considerable amount of your time. It's helpful to plan out activities in advance so that you don't mistakenly squander your time here.
Dimitri: Professors at the Officers Academy are expected to have exceptional leadership skills. Students and teachers alike must devote themselves to their studies and strive to acquire great wisdom, even outside their respective Fields.

Dimitri: I heard about the upcoming mock battle. I want you to know, Professor, that I do not intend to lose. I hereby declare my intention to prevail at... Goodness, listen to me. The thrill of competition has carried me away. I won't speak so formally of a class assignment in the future.

Claude: Did you hear the news, Teach? Looks like we're gonna have a good ol' mock battle between the houses! The Golden Deer House isn't exactly what you'd call an elite group just yet, so you may want to whip everyone into shape with some extra training. After all, competition is only fun if you win. To that end, I'd better prepare as well. You know, I was researching what it's like to live here long before I even enrolled. Want me to fill you in, Teach?
Claude: Students and teachers of the Officers Academy are all free to use the facilities within the monastery. That means you can chow down with students in the dining hall, or get in some one-on-one sparring at the training grounds. As you explore the monastery, try visiting the various facilities and talking to the people who live here.
Claude: If you haven't noticed, there are bulletin boards in various places around here. You can check them out to see posted requests or to find more information about the market. I hear that fulfilling requests can even earn you the right to use more facilities. The bulletin board gets updated frequently, so it's probably a good idea to check it once a month.
Claude: Far be it from me to tell you how to use the facilities, but it's a good idea to be mindful of how you're using your time. If you don't think about how you're spending your free time, it'll be over before you know it.
Claude: Here at the Officers Academy, even professors are expected to study often to help maintain their strong leadership skills. In other words, students and teachers alike have to strive to grow in every possible field.

Claude: Hey, Teach! I hear there's gonna be a mock battle between the houses. I'm not gonna lie, I'm a bit concerned about facing an elite mercenary like you. Maybe take it easy on us, what do you say?

Hubert: Dimitri and Claude are the leaders of the other two houses. Do not underestimate them. When we take the field, it would be best not to engage the both of them at once.

Hubert: If you continue to insist on distracting me, I will have no choice but to get rid of you. Joking, of course. 

Ferdinand: Let me tell you the provenance of our class name. The eagle, that refers to the twin-headed eagle on the Adrestian Empire's coat of arms. And black is the traditional color of the Empire's armor, hence, "Black Eagles."

Linhardt:  The Great Tree Moon is the best time of the year for naps. I could just forget all about my assignment...
Byleth: That's not a good idea.
Byleth: Now I'm feeling sleepy too... 
Linhardt: Yeah... 

Caspar: Who, Jeritza sure seems strong. I kinda thought he was gonna be the new professor assigned to our class. After that teacher ran away during our outdoor training, I figured Jeritza was a natural replacement. I was surprised when you were suddenly appointed professor instead. I don't think I could hold my own against Jeritza in battle. I could probably take you though.
Byleth: Not a chance. 
Caspar: You really think so? With enough training, I'm sure I'll beat you someday!
Byleth: Probably.
Caspar: Hah! Seriously? You should really work on your self-confidence if you're planning on becoming a professor.

Bernadetta: Um. I, ah, was just heading back to my roomâbye!
Byleth: ...
Bernadetta: I don't like to come out unless I really have to. Hope you're OK with that, Professor!

Dorothea: Hi, Professor. How're you doing? If you're not busy, would you like to join me on a little trip into town? If I'm cooped up in this dusty old monastery for too long, it drives me absolutely crazy.

Dorothea: Yes, it's true that I'm the only commoner in the Black Eagle House. I knew that before the first day of class. Those people are simply exhausting.

Petra: Professor. I hope you know I am having great abilities for reading and writing. With sadness, I still have struggles with speaking. If my ways of speak...of speech are causing a burden, I hope you will have forgiveness.

Petra: Here at the monastery, I have had many great learnings from many great people. I am hopeful to have learnings from you too. As forever, I will do my best trying!

Dedue: His Highness has said that he trusts you, and I have no cause for doubt. But if you mistreat him in any way, I will take action.

Dedue: Let me know when you are hungry. I will make you a quality meal, as thanks for your service to His Highness.

Felix: I'm busy. Do you want something?
Byleth: I was hoping to spar with you. 
Felix: I can't right now, but let's fight soon. I look forward to beating you.
Byleth: Nothing in particular.
Felix: Then get out of my way.

Ashe: Oh, did you come to look at the plants too? The greenhouse here is really incredible. There are so many rare flowers I'd never seen back home. And herbs I never even knew existed!
Byleth: I've never had much interest in plants.
Ashe: That's normal. They all looked the same to me before I really studied them.
Byleth: You seem well-informed on the subject. 
Ashe: My adoptive father is the real expert. He taught me everything I know about herbs, including how to tell them apart and how to make medicines.
Ashe: You should try looking around the greenhouse sometime, if the mood strikes you. Maybe something will catch your eye!

Sylvain: Hey, Professor. If you've got spare time, want to join me for a trip into town? We could try to pick up beautiful girls... Or not. I'm kidding! Don't look at me like that.

Sylvain: Well, there's Dorothea, Hilda, and Mercedes. Lady Rhea's quite the beauty too. And I must admit, I've even checked out Professor Manuela once or twice. You know, Professor, I think I'm going to like it at the Officer's Academy. There are beautiful girls as far as the eye can see...

Mercedes: Before I came to the Officers Academy, I attended a school of magic in the Kingdom capital. That's where I met Annie! That's what I call Annette. Oh, I guess Lorenz was at the school of magic too? But Annie was always just so nice to me, even though I was older. She's my best friend in the world.

Annette: Hello, Professor! Uh, I have a teeny tiny question for you, if that's all right... You haven't seen a man with hair the same color as mine, a scowling face, and a generally gloomy demeanour...have you?
Byleth: Looking for someone? 
Annette: Well, yes. It's a bit difficult to explain... Please just let me know if you do see him, OK?
Byleth: Can't say that I have.
Annette: I suppose it was silly to ask. Sorry for wasting your time!

Ingrid: The Blue Lion House derived its names from the honorary title of the first king of Faerghus. Loog, the King of Lions, wore brilliantly blue garments. His chivalric exploits are recorded in multiple legends. The library holds various historical accounts regarding him and the Blue Lions. If you find time, you should read them. They're filled with insights.

Lorenz: Our house is that of the Golden Deer. Do you know the significance of that name, Professor? Golden Deer are sacred creatures said to have protected Leicester since time immemorial. All three of the houses have a meaning behind their name. You should feel free to ask around, if that sort of knowledge interests you.

Raphael: Ugh. I really need to eat. I can't hold out until the next meal! Why can't the dining hall stay open all the time? I need to keep eating if I want to get stronger!

Ignatz: Have you memorized everyone's names yet? I'm Ignatz, in case you forgot. I'm looking forward to learning from you.

Ignatz: This is the Golden Deer House. You're in charge of a different house, right? Too bad we won't see more of each other. I'm happy to learn from you, if the opportunity comes up!

Lysithea: Hi, Professor. Have you gotten around to visiting the library yet? It's absolutely loaded with valuable information. I only wish I wasn't burdened with the necessity of sleep, so I could spend all my hours there.
Byleth: You like reading? 
Lysithea: In a manner, yes. But it's more that I want to learn as much as I possibly can.
Byleth: You ought to get some rest.
Lysithea: Please don't treat me like a child. I may be a bit younger than the others, but that really shouldn't factor in.

Marianne: Goddess, I pray to thee... Please protect us... ...

Hilda: So, about the mock battle that's coming up...you don't mind me sitting it out, do you? As a fragile maiden, I'm useless in battle. I'll just cheer everyone on instead!

Hilda: Oh, Professor! Have you adjusted to life at the academy yet? Me, I'm still not used to it. I'm not one for all this studying and training.

Leonie: I'm Captain Jeralt's first and best apprentice. I can beat anyone, Professor. Even you, if I have to! It may have been only for a short time, but I learned from the absolute best.

Rhea: Do bear in mind that even as you are appraising your students, they are appraising you as well. I hope that you will do your best to form lasting bonds with your flock. Oh, and I look forward to witnessing your prowess in the mock battle.

Seteth: These are the students' quarters. To better help you supervise them, you also have a room here. Your room is here at the end. Commoner students also reside on the first floor, while the second is primarily for students of noble birth. As a rule, we try to avoid discrimination based on social status here. But the nobility can be quite insistent when it comes to matters of propriety. Speaking of, it would be best for you to avoid improper conduct. I expect you to set a good example for the students.

Flayn: Hello there, Professor. Well, I call you that, but I am afraid that I am not a student here myself...
Byleth: That's a shame. 
Flayn: Should the opportunity arise, I would love to become a student and begin my studies in earnest.
Byleth: Where can I visit you, then?
Flayn: My brother would not be pleased if he heard you saying such things.
Flayn: The monastery is kind enough to provide a sanctuary for my brother and I. He's the only family I have.

Alois: Captain Jeralt has hardly changed since 20 years ago. I've aged at least three times as much as he has! Why am I talking about this? Oh, right, it was because I just overheard Tomas remarking on the subject. The leader of a legendary group of knights, returned. People are bound to be talking about the ol' captain!

Jeritza: I care nothing of friendship. If you have no business here, leave.

Jeralt: The church has changed a lot since my time. Seteth, Hanneman, Manuela, Jeritza, and many of the knights... None of them were around 20 years ago. Have you met Leonie yet? Apparently it was my influence that inspired her to leave her village. Sorry to burden you, but could you watch over her for me? She's the only apprentice I've ever had.

Hanneman: Apparently there is to be a mock battle between the houses. Interesting, but I hope you understand that I have far more important things on my mind. My research is proceeding slower than I would like. Your Crest is something of a challenge. Frustrating. Yet, also, quite intriguing. I was wondering if I might get a sample of your flesh. A couple square inches would do. No? Perhaps some blood? A couple of drops on the device are all I need.

Byleth: (It's some kind of experimental apparatus...)
Byleth: I might as well assist by providing a blood sample... 
Hanneman: Oh, thank you, Professor. Those few drops of blood are invaluable to my research! Oh, so much more to learn!
Byleth: I had better keep my distance.

Manuela: A mock battle? This early? Wow, Professor. They're not giving you any time to settle in, are they? Don't you worry though! Should you get injured, I will care for you all through your recuperation. I will see to you oh-so very, very, personally. 

Tomas: Professor, I hear you are lacking in knowledge of the Church of Seiros. The library contains countless documents about the teaching and history of the church. I encourage you to make good use of them.



Cyril: I'm a little busy.
Byleth: Oh, sorry.
Cyril: If you're looking for the greenhouse, it's right there. See it? Looks like a greenhouse? That's it.
Byleth: Can't we talk just a little? 
Cyril: I really can't right now, I got a lot of things to do. Work and stuff like that. Why don't you look at the flowers in the greenhouse instead? They're pretty.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! By the by, have you ever regretted a decision and wished you could go back and undo it? It's too bad there's no lesson for how to turn back the ol' clock, huh? But I suppose a bad decision isn't worth all that fuss anyhow!



Student: I'm not too keen on the professor of my class. I really hoped to focus more on strategy. Hmm, maybe I should talk to my professor about transferring to a different class.



Monk: There are two types of Crests. Major Crests manifest their power most effectively, while Minor Crests are slightly weaker. It is said that the closer a person's blood relation is to various saints and Heroes, the higher their chance of bearing a major Crest. Of course, there are also examples of Major Crests manifesting in children whose parents bear no Crest whatsoever. The exact nature of how and why Crests are inherited is still a mystery.



Priest: I hear a member of House Hresvelg, the ruling family of the Empire, has entered the Officers Academy for the first time in ages. It is said that the Adrestian Empire's very founding was aided by none other than Saint Seiros. That is why the Crest of Seiros is on the Imperial flag. In recent years, a rift has developed between the Empire and the church... Let us hope that this will be a good opportunity for both parties to reforge their close relationship of years past.



Knight of Seiros: As part of our commitment to the goddess, the knights undertake various missions across all of FÃ³dlan. Assisting with the education of young nobles is also a part of our sacred duty.



Knight of Seiros: The Imperial princess, the crown prince, and the heir to the Alliance's leading house... This is one exceptional year, that's for sure. If you're a teacher here, you'd better watch your step. If anything were to happen to those kids... Well, suffice to say that it could harm the reputation of the Church of Seiros, which we've spent almost a millennium establishing.



Monk: Tomas has served as the monastery's librarian for decades. Actually, he was away from Garreg Mach for a spell, but he returned to his post last year. There is no one as familiar with the monastery archives as he is.

@Intro 
^start 
Edelgard: It's finally time for the mock battle. This is my chance to measure your worth as an instructor. Do you think you can rise to the challenge?
Byleth: "Leave it to me." 
Edelgard: So confident. This will be interesting.
Byleth: "I'm concerned..."
Edelgard: That doesn't inspire much confidence, does it?
Edelgard: Each of us has undergone strict training. We're prepared for anything that comes our way. That means there's no need to hold back. Show us what you're capable of.
Claude: Hey there! Did we miss our invite to this strategy meeting? Oh, no worriesâwe'll just join in now.
Edelgard: Simply tell me your weaknesses, and you're welcome to stay. But is there enough time to cover them all?
Claude: Ah, so you can't win unless you know my weakness? Poor princess. You really should believe in yourself more.
Edelgard: I spare no effort when pursuing victory. As a master of schemes, I should think you would understand.
Claude: Schemes? Me? I have no idea what you're talking about! I plan to fight fair and square, as ever.
Dimitri: Hearing the words "fair and square" from Claude can only be a bad omen.
Claude: Your Highnesses haven't known me for very long, but you already have me figured out, don't you?
Dimitri: No need to poke fun. I will fight with honor. That said, I will fight to win.
Edelgard: Yes, and the same is true of us. Right, Professor?
Byleth: "Don't go too hard on us."
Claude: No use trying to hide how you really feel, Teach. I can see it in your eyesâyou don't intend to lose.
Byleth: "I don't intend to lose."
Dimitri: If that is how you feel, then I will not hold back.
Manuela: Aw, how precious. Looks like you and the students have become fast friends.
Hanneman: While I am pleased that you are taking the initiative to acquaint yourself with the students, I'm afraid it's about time for the faculty strategy meeting.
Claude: Ah, how time flies! In that case, I'll see you later.
Dimitri: Edelgard, Professor, be careful out there.

Dimitri: Ah, it's finally time for the mock battle. I'm eager to put my skills to use. And you, Professor?
Byleth: I'm looking forward to it. 
Dimitri: Excellent. I have high expectations for your command. That said, I've no doubt it will take everything we've got to pull a victory.
Byleth: I hope we can win.
Dimitri: I wouldn't worry too much about it. If you command use as you did back in the village, I have no doubt we'll be fine.
Dimitri: Our opponents are mighty, that much is certain, but I'm positive we can win.
Claude: Hey there! Did we miss our invite to this strategy meeting? Oh, no worriesâwe'll just join in now.
Dimitri: Nice try, Claude, but I do not intent to let slip our strategies. Especially when we are up against such strong opponents as you two.
Claude: Well now! Kind words from his kingliness. If that's the case, we'd better come up with some clever schemes so as not to disappoint. Right, Princess?
Edelgard: Right. No matter the tactics you devise, we will destroy you. The best you can hope for is to learn a thing or two.
Dimitri: Haha, there's nothing wrong with a friendly rivalry, but let's not get carried away. A rash attitude could be your undoing, after all.
Edelgard: Hmm... Perhaps your time would be better spent preparing instead of worrying about the competition's mindset.
Claude: Hey, now! If you two are getting this fired up before the battle even starts...it'll make it that much easier for my class to sweep up a win. So please, carry on.
Dimitri: A good point, Claude. I apologizeâthat wasn't my intention. At any rate, let's vow to make this a productive battle, shall we?
Byleth: Don't go too hard on us.
Claude: No use trying to hide how you really feel, Teach. I can see it in your eyesâyou don't intend to lose.
Byleth: I don't intend to lose.
Edelgard: Oh? In that case, I won't hold back.
Manuela: Aw, how precious. Looks like you and the students have become fast friends.
Hanneman: While I am pleased that you are taking the initiative to acquaint yourself with the students, I'm afraid it's about time for the faculty strategy meeting.
Claude: Ah, how time flies! In that case, I'll see you later.
Edelgard: I look forward to assessing your abilities. I hope you don't disappoint.

Claude: Time for a mock battle, eh? Hmm, how should we go about this... Well, you'll be our commander, that much is for sure. Just don't screw it up and everything'll be great. Got it, Teach?
Byleth: I'm not concerned.
Byleth: Leave it to me.
Claude: Right. I'll do whatever I can to help too. I mean, I'm kind of obligated to. For example! If I add a little something to their food to upset their stomachs...
Byleth: Don't even think about it.
Claude: Yeah, yeah, wink, wink. I read you. You can't officially condone that sort of thing, right? But say, hypothetically speaking, students from the other houses started racing to the infirmary... As far as anyone knows, it could just be a harmless little stomach bug making the rounds.
Edelgard: Well, well. What a fascinating conversation you two are having. May we join?
Dimitri: Claude, I can't believe you would stoop to such crooked schemes to gain the advantage. Have you no honor?
Claude: If that was really my scheme, I wouldn't be talking about it out in the open. I'm afraid you'll have to wait until our battle to see what's really in store.
Edelgard: It's irrelevant anyhow. Whatever you have planned won't save you from a crushing defeat.
Dimitri: She has a point. Still, I'm rather eager to see what sort of scheme that mind of yours conjures up.
Claude: You heard 'em, Teach. We can't let these fine folks down.
Byleth: It will be a fair fight.
Claude: Heh, of course. A fair fight, as all fights are. Good one, Teach. Play innocent now so they won't see it coming.
Byleth: If they insist. 
Claude: Are you serious, Teach? Well, if a crooked scheme is really what you're after, I've got more than a few of those up my sleeve.
Manuela: Aw, how precious. Looks like you and the students have become fast friends.
Hanneman: While I am pleased that you are taking the initiative to acquaint yourself with the students, I'm afraid it's about time for the faculty strategy meeting.
Dimitri: I'm sorry, Professors. It's about time I returned to my training anyhow. Claude, Edelgard, until we meet again on the battlefield, farewell.
Edelgard: I look forward to assessing your abilities. I hope you don't disappoint.

@Opening 
Formerly a promising young mercenary, you are now the newest professor at the prestigious Officers Academy. Students and faculty alike look on with curiosity as you engage in a mock battle between the school's three houses.

@Battle 
Edelgard: The mock battle is finally here. Will you lead us to victory?

Jeralt: I'm sure you already understand, but the house that defeats the other two is declared the winner. Incidentally, I'll be overseeing this mock battle. So listen well if you want to win.

Lorenz: None of your shallow tactics are required, Claude. Ignatz and I will dismantle the opposition.
Ignatz: Me?! But I'm not ready!
Claude: Are you making light of our new professor? If you drop your guard, you're going to get hurt...
Dimitri: Ashe, can you move to the front lines? I want to lure the enemy this way.
Ashe: Got it, Your Highness! Leave it to me!
Dimitri: Once you've finished preparing, make your move. Dedue, Mercedes. Keep our enemy occupied until then.
Dedue: I'm on it.
Mercedes: Oh my! We'll try our best!

Claude: Well done, Teach! I may have to take this seriously after all!

Claude: Let's use the forest to set up an ambush. I'm counting on your support, everyone!
Jeralt: If they're waiting in the forest, we'd do well to take a detour.

Claude: Welp, we're surrounded. All we can do is fight back with all our might!

Claude: Are you really gonna fight two houses at once? Heh, an impressive display of confidence.
Dimitri: This is a good opportunity for us. Let's forge ahead!

Dimitri: Beautiful work, Professor. But the true challenge starts now!

@Boss 
%Byleth,Dimitri
Dimitri: You're a tough opponent, but I refuse to yield. Do not fool yourself into believing I will hold back!

%Edelgard,Dimitri
Edelgard: Dimitri... It's time! We can finally settle the question of who's stronger.
Dimitri: Very well. I accept your challenge. With you as my opponent, I won't hold anything back.
Edelgard: I would expect no less!

%Byleth,Claude
Claude: Coming up with brilliant schemes, I can handle. No problem. But I'm not much for fighting. Go easy on me!
Byleth: ...
Claude: You know that was a joke, right? Jeez, not so much as a smile...

%Edelgard,Claude
Claude: Look at that, a real life princess! I'll have to be careful not to scar that little face of yours.
Edelgard: Careful, Claude. I'll win no matter what, but you're only making things harder for yourself.
Claude: Losing hasn't even crossed your mind, has it? Ooh, this'll be a bit of a shock, then.
Edelgard: To shock was your intention to begin with, was it not?

@Character-Falls 
Lorenz: I've lost?! Oh! Unthinkable!

Ignatz: I've lost. The new professor is quite a commander.

Hilda: Ouch! Was that really necessary?

Claude: Argh, I hate losing! I guess I'll just have to settle for cheering the others on.

Claude: I must have let my guard down. I guess that's a loss for the Golden Deer House.

Manuela: Well done. I nearly wound up a patient in my own infirmary.

Ashe: Ahâso strong! Have to do better next time...

Dedue: Ngh. Apologies, Your Highness. I can go no further.

Mercedes: Oh no... This is as far as I can go...

Dimitri: My training was insufficient... I am so sorry, everyone. The rest is up to you.

Dimitri: I suppose that does it for the Blue Lion House...

Hanneman: My goodness. The leadership of someone with actual battle experience is... Well! I was as good as useless.

Ferdinand: I am the son of House Aegir! How did I fail? I must need to train harder...

Hubert: Hmm. The new professor's rather strong. Suppose I'll have to call it a day.

Dorothea: My, my... The new professor seems very capable.

Edelgard: Forced to retreat... Well, things will only get tougher from here on out.

Edelgard: To think that the Black Eagles could lose so readily...

@End 
Jeralt: All right, that's that! The winner of this mock battle is... The Black Eagle House!

Edelgard: Even though it was just a mock battle, we defeated both houses masterfully. Take pride in this victory, everyone!

Dimitri: This victory is the result of everyone's hard work. Thank you, my friends. You did well.

@Battle 
Dimitri: It is about time for the battle to begin. Our victory depends on your leadership. Do not let us down.

Lorenz: None of your shallow tactics are required, Claude. Ignatz and I will dismantle the opposition.
Ignatz: Me?! But I'm not ready!
Claude: Are you making light of our new professor? If you drop your guard, you're going to get hurt...
Edelgard: Dorothea, will you head towards the front lines? I wish to draw the enemy towards us.
Dorothea: You got it, Edie. Leave it to me.
Edelgard: Ferdinand. Hubert. If the enemy comes, stop them.
Ferdinand: Leave it to us, although I could do this on my own.
Hubert: Heh. Clearly not, or Her Highness would not ask me to watch your back.

Claude: Well done, Teach! I may have to take this seriously after all!

Claude: Let's use the forest to set up an ambush. I'm counting on your support, everyone!
Jeralt: If they're waiting in the forest, we'd do well to take a detour.

Claude: Welp, we're surrounded. All we can do is fight back with all our might!


Claude: Are you really gonna fight two houses at once? Heh, an impressive display of confidence.
Edelgard: Victory is in sight, Black Eagles. Do not let up!

Edelgard: Flawless tactics, Professor. Our only choice in this situation is a head-on attack!

@Boss 
%Dimitri,Claude
Claude: Psst, Your Princliness. You've got a thing for Edelgard, right? Come on, fess up. You'll feel better.
Dimitri: Claude, please. This is no time for idle banter. Your defenses are wide open.
Claude: That didn't get to him, huh? What a shame. I'll find a better way to ruffle him up next time.

%Byleth,Edelgard 
Edelgard: There can be no victory unless I defeat you. So be it!

@Battle 
Claude: So this is the stage for the mock battle... The command's all yours, Teach!

Ferdinand: I will fight on the front lines! I can stop the enemy's advance with grace!
Hubert: Do you have Lady Edelgard's permission to--hmph. I suppose I've no choice but to provide cover.
Edelgard: Thank you Hubert. We are off to a terrible start.
Dimitri: Ashe, can you move to the front lines? I want to lure the enemy this way.
Ashe: Got it, Your Highness! Leave it to me!
Dimitri: Once you've finished preparing, make your move. Dedue, Mercedes. Keep our enemy occupied until then.
Dedue: I'm on it.
Mercedes: Oh my! We'll try our best!

Edelgard: Hm, you are performing as expected, Professor. We will have to face you with our full might!

Edelgard: We will use the forest to ambush our enemy. Everyone, I am counting on your support!
Jeralt: If they're waiting in the forest, we'd do well to take a detour.

Edelgard: It seems we're surrounded... At a time like this, our only option is to cut a path through!

Edelgard: Are you planning on fighting two houses at once? I will admit, that is favorable for us.
Dimitri: This is a good opportunity for us. Let's forge ahead!

Dimitri: Beautiful work, Professor. But the true challenge starts now!

@End 
Claude: Great work, everyone! Even if it's just a mock battle, the taste of victory is sugary sweet!

^start 
Edelgard: Excellent work today, Professor. Though our victory should come as no surprise.
Byleth: It was a close call.
Edelgard: Was it? I'm not sure I agree with that.
Byleth: It was easy.
Edelgard: Yes, it was. Further proof that you're well qualified to guide the Black Eagles.
Petra: That was impressing, Professor! I mean...impressive. We gained a victory because of your great leadership.
Dorothea: We certainly did. We all tried our best, of course, but we couldn't have won without you.
Ferdinand: I was curious what it would look like if you did not hold back. And you did not disappoint!
Hubert: Hmph. I daresay we owe our victory to Lady Edelgard.
Linhardt: How so? For that battle, she was only a soldier following our professor's command. Sure, she was an incredibly powerful soldier...
Caspar: Don't worry about it too much, Linhardt. All that matters is that we won!
Bernadetta: I'm all done with being on the battlefield, OK? I'd rather stay back than pursue victory out there.
Edelgard: You are all as ridiculous as always. We only managed to win because we worked together.
Edelgard: Was it something I said? Is it so odd, me talking about togetherness? If so, that perception must change. In fact, I'm canceling the festivities so we can discuss this topic further. I'm kidding, of course. Come on, everyone! We've earned this celebration.

Dimitri: Professor! I've been looking for you.
Dimitri: I was hoping we could all share a meal together. It could serve as both a victory celebration and a post-battle analysis. What do you think?
Byleth: A victory celebration?
Dimitri: Of course. After all, we fought hard out there. Such exertion is bound to make anyone hungry for respite, don't you agree?
Byleth: I'm invited?
Dimitri: Of course. Why wouldn't you be?
Sylvain: Come now, Professor! We can't very well celebrate without the key to our victory present.
Annette: He's right! He really is! We were only able to win because we had your help, Professor!
Felix: Yes. Compared with that boar who knows nothing save frontal attacks, your tactics were nearly decent.
Ingrid: Felix! You really ought to stop picking fights with His Highness.
Dimitri: Don't worry, Ingrid. I encourage all to speak freely. And I must agree that the professor's tactics were truly extraordinary. I have much to learn.
Mercedes: Oh, sure, but today was exhausting, I'm so hungry I can barely stand...
Ashe: To be honest, so am I. Let's head to the dining hall. Together.
Byleth: ...
Dimitri: Professor. I'm sorry to intrude, but...you don't look too happy for someone who just won.
Byleth: You're mistaken.
Dimitri: You say that, but your eyes tell a different story.
Byleth: Is that so...
Dimitri: Hm. Well, I understand how difficult it can be to accept joy sometimes. I'm sorry for prying.
Dimitri: I know we only just met, so this may be difficult for you, but... I'd love nothing more than to share our happiness with you. Joy can be so fleeting, after all. We're all in this together...so I hope you will consent. I'm sure the rest of the class feels the very same. Well...come along, Professor. Let's enjoy the fruits of our labor!

Claude: Great work, Teach! That was a brilliant win.
Byleth: I'm glad we won.
Claude: I've been anticipating that magic moment when your tactics and my schemes entwined, and you did not disappoint. That composed expression you always sport like a permanent mask is a perfect complement to my ruthless scheme. That's a joke, of course. Mostly.
Byleth: Everyone did well.
Claude: Huh. Playing ignorant as to the quality of you command and deflecting the praise to your students. You really are a model professor, Teach.
Claude: To be honest, I had a bunch of other schemes planned as well, just in case the situation called for it. But I didn't have to resort to any of them. I suppose our opponents lucked out.
Lorenz: Well met, Professor! The breadth of your skill was on full display today. I must admit that your tactics were masterful. I shudder to think what may have transpired had it been Claude leading us into battle.
Raphael: I noticed that too! We just did what you told us, and we won! I love it!
Lysithea: As expected from a child of the former captain of the knights. Thank you for today, Professor. I have much to consider.
Hilda: I never doubted that our professor would be amazing! It was way too obvious. Don't you agree, Marianne?
Marianne: Huh? Me? Oh, um, yes. Of course. Well done, Professor.
Leonie: Captain Jeralt taught his child well. It would have been more of a surprise had our professor proved lacking.
Ignatz: Don't you think it's a bit hard to give Jeralt all of the credit, Leonie? In any case, it's clear that we only won because of our new mentor's guidance.
Claude: A mercenary's wisdom and techniques are forged in battle. Those are the sorts of things you can only learn through experience. Right, Teach? But more importantly, it's time to celebration our victory! Teach here has yet to try my well renowned home cooking.
Claude: I really do hope you'll join us. After all, I swiped some finely aged cheese from the dining hall for just this occasion.
^end

@Dialogue 
Rhea: Your work with the students was remarkable. I can see Jeralt trained you well. I do hope you were able to use the occasion to bond with the students.
Byleth: I did.
Rhea: I am so happy to hear it. Nothing would please me more than if you would use this coming year to grow closer still.
Byleth: Not really.
Rhea: Oh? Well, you have only just met them, so I suppose that should come as no surprise.
Seteth: Of course, the mock battle was mere practice. The real fight is the Battle of the Eagle and Lion, which will take place during the Wyvern Moon. You are expected to properly train your students so as not to humiliate the academy during the long-held tradition that is the coming battle.

Rhea: As for today, I have called you here to tell you of your mission for the month ahead. Your class is to dispose of some bandits causing trouble nearby.
Byleth: My mission?
Byleth: Bandits?
Seteth: Those affiliated with Garreg Mach Monastery have a moral obligation to help those in need, regardless of social standing. Students are no exception. Each month, before the newly birthed moon departs, each house of students must complete their assigned mission. You shall work to complete the task at hand alongside your students and report back to the archbishop before the deadline. Understood? I will soon provide you with the necessary details for your first mission. If I told you now, I expect you would only forget, and I despise repeating myself.
Rhea: I can sense something special within your heart... I have high hopes for you.

Sothis: Bandits, they say...
Byleth: ?!
Sothis: Do you recall when we first met? You shall not fall so shamelessly again, correct?
Byleth: ...
Sothis: Have you no words for me? Do not tell me that you are shocked to hear from me! You ought to know that I am always with you now. To hear my voice should not come as a shock.
Byleth: Right.
Byleth: I don't understand.
Sothis: Whatever shall I do with you? I am alive within the confines of your heart. I am unknown to all but you. But through your eyes and ears, I see and hear. Just listen to your heart, as you are doing now, and we may speak like this. That is all that I know.
Byleth: ...

Kostas: What is this nonsense?! All I was told was to kill as many noble pipsqueaks as possible! No one said anything about the Knights of damned Seiros being on our trail!

Flame Emperor: You have proven yourself worthless. Distracted by something so trivial. I had hoped you would achieve your goal despite the setback. But now a child of the Knightsâ former captain is in play. How interesting.
Kostas: Hey, this isn't what I agreed to!
Flame Emperor: Hiring a mercenary as a professor. What was that woman thinking?
Kostas: Are you listening to me?! How do we finish this?!
Flame Emperor: You die.
Kostas: Whâ What?
Flame Emperor: Underestimating the Knights was an amateur mistake. One you will pay for. The road to eternal torment awaits you all. Now I must locate your replacements...

Kostas: Wait! Get back here! Damn you!
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Though most stars will still glimmer in the crisp winter air, the blue sea star has gone back into hiding. Legend states that the goddess prays for peace from her home in the heavens. In the town of Garreg Mach, the anniversary of the monastery's completion nears, and the people's prayers intensify ahead of the millennium festival, still five years hence.

@Intro 
Rhea: We are planning a grand ball for this month. I am sure the students will be most pleased.
Seteth: Yes, certainly. However, we must not devote all of our time to frivolity. We have a new mission for you. We have found evidence of someone sneaking into an unused chapel.
Byleth: A chapel?
Rhea: It is a building that was once a temporary sanctuary at a time when the monastery was under renovation.
Byleth: Was something stolen?
Rhea: No, there is nothing of value in that building. We do not yet know what the intruders' objectives are.
Seteth: This month, your class is tasked with guarding the chapel and investigating these intruders. With the recent state of affairs surrounding the holy church, we cannot afford to overlook any abnormality, no matter how seemingly trivial.
Rhea: I am ordering a seasoned knight to assist you to ensure the safety of the students. In times like these, I am afraid we must always expect the worst.
Byleth: That's reassuring.
Byleth: Which knight?

Jeralt: Reporting for duty, Lady Rhea.
Rhea: I thought you two could use the time to bond. And to speak of important matters...
Jeralt: Appreciate the thought.
Seteth: Bear in mind that Jeralt has a separate mission of his own. He will join you once he has finished it.
Jeralt: It's true. I'll be away from the monastery for a while. But when I return... I'll come and watch you work. I'll be looking forward to it.

@Conversation 
Sothis: Tomas... No, Solon, was it not? And the Flame Emperor... It is most clear that something has transpired. And it relates to you somehow. Or is the fault my own, and you're just caught inside the wave... Sothis, the goddess of this world... I bear her name... Hmm... How confusing. I feel as though my head has turned to mush!



Edelgard: Everyone's in such a festive mood. I feel a bit out of my element here. I can't help but worry something might happen while we're all distracted... After all, our enemies are always plotting. Still, this air of levity is much more agreeable than the grim atmosphere of late.



Dimitri: It seems the dastards who set Remire Village aflame have yet to be apprehended. Monsters. Trampling mercilessly over innocent lives. They deserve a gruesome end...



Claude: Someone entered the old chapel... I think the townsfolk used it for feasts and such in the past. With that whole Tomas business, you can't blame the church for being on edge.



Hubert: Another month full of chaos. I've barely had time to catch my breath. What is the objective of Tomas and his ilk? And what makes Flayn so specialâdoes that not bother you?



Ferdinand: Ah, the ball. It reminds me of my first such event, back in the Imperial capital. It was held by my father, the prime minister. I really showed off my dancing skills! Everyone was quite impressed with me.



Linhardt: You know, Professor, I used to think I would be comfortable with all manner of experiments, so long as they provided usable results. But when I heard of Solon's work, well, I realized I'd not consider the moral and philosophical limits of what "all manner of experiments" might mean. Urk... Sorry. I'm not great with blood, even when I'm just thinking about it. I feel a bit ill now.



Caspar: I can't believe this... I'm so angry right now! First it's the Death Knight, and now Tomas, and neither of them are in custody! I can't stand the thought of such evil lurking in the world. We have to do something about this! I have to do something about this!

Bernadetta: The ball. A grim reminder of my sad reality. The other nobles will be fine, I'm sure. They've all been to events like this before. But me? I'm a noble, and I've never even been close to one of these things!



Dorothea: I wonder if Remire Village will ever be the same again. How do you recover from such a terrible event? So many dead, so much destroyed... I can't see how the whole village doesn't just end up abandoned.

Dorothea: Our class was also sent to help put the village in order. But then...



Petra: Dancing of FÃ³dlan is not the same as dancing of Brigid. The reason is maybe that the music has many differences. In Brigid, dancing is different for each person. Our dancing has vigor and ferocity. There is no speech of technique for our dancing.



Dedue: Even though there is to be a ball, we still have a mission. It would be nice if this month passed by in peace.



Felix: Argh... Too much merriment. The librarian betrayed us. The Death Knight is back. Is this the time to be throwing a ball?



Ashe: Last month wasâ Well, you know even better than I do. I hope this one will be more cheerful. This ball though... I don't know. It's all new to me.



Sylvain: Great work in Remire Village, Professor. Who would have ever guessed it was Tomas? Ah, but no. Now isn't the time to get lost in gloomy thoughts.



Mercedes: Oh, now, where did that Ingrid run off to? The ball is soon and she hadn't even put on any makeup! I was trying to help her out.



Annette: So, Tomas the librarian was a bad guy? But he always seemed so nice! C'mon, self. You're better than this. You promised you'd be on top of things this month.



Ingrid: Mercedes locked me in her room for hours earlier... She was slathering pounds of makeup onto my face. Saying something or other about the ball. It really wore me out...



Lorenz: Ah. The long-awaited ball. Finally, an opportunity to showcase my exquisite skills on the dance floor. These skills were ingrained in me when I was a boy. My hands and feet move on pure instinct.



Raphael: The ball is coming up soon! I am so excited! I can't wait to fill up on food while everyone's dancing. I even heard there'll be some prime cuts of meat!



Ignatz: Some scary things have been happening lately. I hope that this month, of all months, is peaceful. The ball is coming up and everything... Although I'm not much of a dancer actually.



Lysithea: It's true that Tomas was employed here under the recommendation of House Ordelia. But that's all I know of the topic. I'd never even seen him prior to enrolling here. Even when he was supposedly in Ordelia territory, I never once saw him there. I'm still feeling bothered by all of this, but...there's not much else I can say about it right now.



Marianne: A ball? Um, I don't think I'll partake.



Hilda: It's almost time for the ball! Oooh my, am I excited! This being a school, we don't have many chances to get dressy.



Leonie: I'm glad the Remire Village situation got sorted out. But it's not over yet, is it? And I can't believe old Tomas turned out to be an enemy. Who can you trust anymore?




Rhea: Before the ball, it is customary that we host a competition of dance known as the White Heron Cup. The students are quite fond of this tradition. Each house must select representatives to compete. Their dance shall be judged by its beauty, grace, and technique. The student who is deemed the winner will be given the opportunity to train as a dancer, should they so please. It is a very precious thing, the gift of dance. I hope that you and your students will choose to participate.



Rhea: I have been told that your house won the White Heron Cup. This can only be a result of the students' talent and effort, not to mention your steadfast instruction.


Rhea: It would appear your house was defeated in the White Heron Cup. With the White Heron Cup concluded, all that is left is to wait for the ball. I hope you will find it enjoyable.


Rhea: It has come to my attention that you did not participate in the White Heron Cup. Were none of your students skilled in dance? With the White Heron Cup concluded, all that is left is to wait for the ball. I hope you will find it enjoyable.



Seteth: I have looked into Tomas, but I just cannot make sense of this at all. From his behavior up until now, I never would have suspected that a man like him could turn on us. I have also discovered that his appearance has changed... It is almost as if he is not even human! What in the world is going on?



Flayn: Hello Professor! The ball will soon be upon us. Ah, I can feel my heart fluttering already! I... I have never danced in front of people before. Not even once in all my life. I am very much looking forward to it!



Alois: Ah, the ball... It reminds me of how I met my wife. I was at a village's harvest festival. There was a full moon bathing everything in its cool glow. She appeared out of nowhere, dancing gracefully in the moonlightâa lovely fairy!
Byleth: That story sounds fake.
Alois: Hah! The "full moon" was an embellishment, I admit. But you can forgive a man for waxing poetic, can't you? Anyway...
Byleth: That's a wonderful story. 
Alois: We soon fell in love and tied the knot. Now we have a daughter, who's as bright and beautiful as a sunny morning. So, whenever I see people dancing, I think of my wife, and my heart does a little waltz.



Catherine: The area with the old chapel was supposed to be off-limits. It was at risk of collapse, so they didn't even post guards. It's not too strange. Does that surprise you? Eh, Garreg Mach has lots of places that are blocked off for one reason or another. That's true of the underground Holy Mausoleum as well as the northern woods. People call it the sealed forest, but as far as I can tell, it's nothing special. Just a forest.



Shamir: What's this about? The ball? Knights don't participate. It's an event for students, but it does pique the interest of some knights in particular.
Shamir: Alois can't dance, but I hear he likes to watch. He volunteered to judge the White Heron Cup. Not that I care.



Gilbert: It cannot be true that our siblings-in-arms could turn against us. However, I will continue investigating members of the church. To think even someone as senior as Tomas would fall under suspicion... I know not how far to take my search.
Byleth: Even the knights...
Gilbert: Unlike the monks, the Knights of Seiros are Lady Rhea's direct subordinates. Some are in quite unique circumstances, but I cannot think any of them would betray us.
Byleth: Even the students... 
Gilbert: Yes, a great many strange and terrible things have come to pass this year... I must not dismiss the possibility that someone among the students is behind it all.



Hanneman: Garreg Mach Monastery is said to have been completed during the Ethereal Moon. Why, 995 years ago as a matter of fact. That's rather a long time ago, don't you think? Every year, a ball is held to celebrate the founding. And every one hundred years, a very special celebration takes place. It's a grand festival, involving all of Garreg Mach. It is thrilling to read of past festivals, and I'm rather excited to experience one for myself. Once in a lifetime, eh? The next one, in five years, will make a millennium. Should be quite an event. Do you imagine you'll still be here teaching then?



Manuela: Great. Just...great. It's that time when all the students get all lovey-dovey. You're new, but you know about the ball, yeah? I can't bear it. Young love is wasted on the young. They can't appreciate it to its fullest! Ugh, I wish I could fall in love too...

Manuela: Oh! Speaking of the ball, Professor, have you selected your representative for the dance contest yet? If you don't, the contest will go on without your house. And that would be...embarrassing.



Cyril: Nah, Tomas wouldn't betray the church. I don't believe it. I won't believe it! There's some people in the church who hate people like me who are from Almyra, but Tomas was always real kind. But if he really was Lady Rhea's enemy... Well, I'd defend her against anybody. No matter how kind they'd been in the past.

Anna: Hey, Professor. How's it going? Making lots of coin? I'd love to catch up, but I'm super busy right now. Working. For money. You understand.

Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Ah, other than the legend of the Goddess Tower, of course. Have you heard the students talking about it? On the last night of the Ethereal Moon, on the same night as the ball... If a man and a woman go to the Goddess Tower and make a wish, it's sure to come true! I have a wish, but I can't find anybody to make it with me...
Byleth: (Is there someone I feel that way about?)

Rhea: The White Heron Cup is a competition of skill and grace in dance. Please encourage your house to participate. That said, if you are serious about winning, be sure to choose your representative carefully.

Edelgard: By the way, have you chosen our house's representative for the White Heron Cup? If nobody else comes to mind, I'm willing to take up the challenge, Professor.

Edelgard: Understood. Just leave this to me and victory is assured. 

Edelgard: I see... If you believe there's someone more qualified, I certainly won't object. 

Hubert: On a lighter note. I've heard you've yet to choose a class representative for the White Heron Cup. It's not something I'm interested in, but if no one else wants to do it, then I will shoulder the burden.

Hubert: How very whimsical of you. I suppose I'll have to do what I can. 

Hubert: Wise. Better to choose someone with more charm. 

Ferdinand: Do you see what I am trying to say here? Do not make me beg you... Please, choose me as our representative for the White Heron Cup!

Ferdinand: Wonderful! You will have a chance to see the legendary footwork of House Aegir! 

Ferdinand: Hmph. If you really think someone is better suited for it, I will not argue. 

Linhardt: Let us change the subject and settle my stomach. I assume you've heard about the dance competition? Have you chosen a representative yet? Or... Oh my. You haven't, have you? Have you come to tell me I'm to be it?

Linhardt: I see... I can dance, in theory, but I dare say in practice things may go very differently. 

Linhardt: I think that's wise. I simply can't really be bothe-- What I mean to say is I lack the confidence. 

Caspar: Ugh. Sorry about that, Professor. I'm just so frustrated right now. I need something to take my mind off things. That reminds me! If you're looking for a volunteer, I'd be happy to represent our class in the White Heron Cup. I'm an excellent Dancer.

Caspar: Great! We both know I'm our class's best chance at winning this thing. 

Caspar: You really think you can find a better dancer than me? 

Bernadetta: What is a White Heron Cup, anyway? Wh-what?! A dance competition?! That's terrifying! W-we need a representative for our class?! Please, anyone but Bernie!

Bernadetta: You're just trying to humiliate me, aren't you? 

Bernadetta: Oh, what a relief! Thank you so much, Professor! 

Dorothea: I'm sorry, Professor. I'm talking about such grim and terrible things when we could be talking about the White Heron Cup. It's a big dance contest between the classes, and I simply adore dancing. I'm quite good at it, since I was a diva in an opera company, you know.

Dorothea: I think my heart just skipped a beat. You want me to represent the class? I'm not sure when I last experienced such flattery, Professor. 

Dorothea: What? Why not me? Oh, whatever. So long as you remember to chose someone, hm? 

Petra: Are you choosing me to represent at the White Heron Cup? Or are you not?

Petra: I will display all that I have learned. I will grab the victory! 

Petra: I have understanding. You believe that I cannot grab the victory, I am guessing? 

Dimitri: I... I'm sorry. Please ignore my troubled ramblings. Was something the matter? Something to do with the White Heron Cup? Professor, I beg of you. Please do not chose me as our house representative. I am utterly serious.

Dimitri: What?! Curse you, Professor. I will of course accept, but know that you have damned us all. 

Dimitri: Oh, thank the goddess. Please be sure to select someone with the confidence to win for us. 

Dedue: Incidentally, I have heard there will be a dance competition prior to the ball. Have you chosen a representative yet?

Dedue: I will take part, if you insist. 

Dedue: Someone must want to participate. You would do well to find that person. 

Felix: Ah, whatever. You look like you're about to say something. Are you considering me as our representative for the White Heron Cup? Heh.

Felix: I was joking. You really couldn't find anyone else? 

Felix: I see. That's a relief. 

Ashe: But speaking of the ball, isn't there something happening just before it? The White...Heron...something? It sounds like every class needs a representative. Have you picked ours yet?

Ashe: Are you sure you want m-me to do this? I guess I'll just have to do the best I can, then. 

Ashe: You should pick one of the nobles. They all have experience with this sort of thing. 

Sylvain: The ball is almost here...and the White Heron Cup dance contest. So, Professor, who will be representing our class?

Sylvain: Me? Uh, sure! Why not? I'll get out there, show off my moves, and drive the ladies wild. 

Sylvain: I get it. No worries, really. I'd rather see a beautiful person dancing instead of some goof like me. 

Mercedes: While we're on the subject of the ball, what's this I hear about a dance competition? Physical activity isn't my forte, but dancing can be fun! If there's no one else you'd rather select, I'm happy to represent our class.

Mercedes: Thanks for having faith in me, Professor! I'll try my best to win! 

Mercedes: Are you sure? Please let me know if you change your mind! 

Annette: After all, we have the ball to look forward to, and the White Heron Cup before that! Oh, speaking of have you chosen our house representative yet? If not, I'd like to volunteer!

Annette: Really? That's fantastic! I'll try as hard as anyone's ever tried, you can count on it! 

Annette: Aw, that's too bad. But if you reconsider, you know where to find me! 

Ingrid: Speaking of, I heard that there's going to be a dance competition. Have you sorted out who will represent our class, Professor? It's not me, is it? Please don't say it's me...

Ingrid: Oh dear... Well, I'll see what I can do, then. On my honor. 

Ingrid: Thank goodness. I don't know the first thing about dancing. 

Claude: Considering this recent rash of strange incidents, I wonder if having a ball is really the best idea... And then there's the White Heron Cup. Sheesh. What poor sap are you enlisting to represent our house, Teach?

Claude: Claude: Me?! Don't be unreasonable, Teach! Ugh... I mean, if I have to make a miracle happen, I guess I'll figure it out... 



Hilda: Oh, but first, the White Heron Cup! Who will appear onstage, I wonder? You're choosing a representative for the dance contest, isn't that right? Choose me! I'm a pro!

Hilda: Great! Now that I'm in the spotlight, I'll do anything to win! 

Hilda: Aww, I was really getting excited for it. Let me know if you change your mind, huh? 

Lorenz: From what I hear, the White Heron Cup will be held just prior to the ball. Say no more, Professor. I would consider it an honor to represent our class!

Lorenz: You will not regret this choice! 

Lorenz: By all means, take your time and think it over. But I do assure you, there is no candidate better suited to the task than yours truly. 

Raphael: Apparently there's supposed to be a dance contest too. I think it's called the White Heron Cup. Who's gonna represent our class? I can do it if you haven't picked someone else!

Raphael: You made the right choice, Professor! Everyone's gonna think my moves are hilarious! 

Raphael: Aww, really? I may not look it, but I'm actually a pretty good dancer. 

Ignatz: Watching other people dance can be fun though. I've heard people talking about the White Heron Cup. Do you know who will be representing us?

Ignatz: Me?! What? No, please! You can't! 

Ignatz: I think a noble would make for a better choice. Bound to know their way around a ballroom. 

Lysithea: Right... It's the dance this month, isn't it? I can't see how anyone would be much in the mood for dancing, considering... Although I suppose the White Heron Cup does sound pretty fun.

Lysithea: Uh, you want me to be our representative? I've certainly got a few moves... 

Lysithea: It would probably be more logical to ask someone who likes dancing in the first place, so I certainly understand. 

Marianne: There's a dance contest as well? I see. I'll cheer for our class, of course. So, um... Who will represent our house in the contest?

Marianne: I see, well... Um, I'm sorry. What did you say? 

Marianne: I'm sure whoever represents our class will do a fine job. Much better than I could do. 

Leonie: The ball? Doesn't matter. I don't dance. I might show up for the food though. Not that it's got anything to do with me, but have you picked someone to represent us for the White Heron Cup yet?

Leonie: What? You're asking a peasant to dance? You've got some pretty weird ideas! 

Leonie: Well, someone's bound to want to do it. I'm sure we've got a few people with the talent to win too. 

Flayn: Have you heard yet about the White Heron Cup? If you have yet to choose a representative, do you mind terribly if I volunteer?

Flayn: Ah, thank you, Professor! I am overcome with joy! Just you wait until my feet touch the ballroom floor! 

Flayn: Understood. Ah, well. Either way, I am still so excited about the ball! 

Edelgard: Well, I suppose we should practice, then. Shall we?

Edelgard: How was that? I believe I've improved my technique. 

Edelgard: Huh... Well, let's practice whenever you can spare the time. Agreed? 

Hubert: To think I'd be rehearsing my dance moves, of all things. Give me some advice, Professor.

Hubert: A little less grotesque now? Maybe. 

Hubert: All right. But if we want to avoid a tragic accident during the contest, I will need more practice. 

Ferdinand: Professor, uh... Do you know how to dance? I could really use some guidance.

Ferdinand: You really can do everything! I am envious of you, if you will pardon my frankness. 

Ferdinand: Fair enough. You do not think I need guidance. You are probably right. 

Linhardt: Professor? Are you here to practice with me for the dance contest?

Linhardt: I don't enjoy a bit of this, you know. Entirely too much standing up and moving around for my taste. But if I'm going to do it, I may as well be in it to win. 

Linhardt: I see... Well, that's just fine by me. There's a book on fishing that I'd like to finish. 

Caspar: Hey, Professor! Did you want to practice dancing with me?

Caspar: What did you think? Pretty perfect, right? 

Caspar: You're probably right. I don't need any more practice. I'm a natural! 

Bernadetta: Professor! Will you give me some dancing lessons?

Bernadetta: Was that okay? A little reassuring at least? Maybe? 

Bernadetta: Is this your idea of an education? Clip my wings and toss me off a cliff?! 

Dorothea: Hey, Professor. You're here to help me practice for the dance contest?

Dorothea: How was that? Was my dancing everything you hoped for and more? I certainly enjoyed it. We simply must do it again. Soon. 

Dorothea: Well, I am terribly talented, agreed. Still, I think I'll practice on my own if you're too busy. 

Petra: I have much to be learned. We will now practice the dancing, OK?

Petra: I have much more knowledge of FÃ³dlan lance. How is my dancing, Professor? 

Petra: That is not fortunate. I will have patience. 



Dimitri: I am in the thick of battle, so battle I must. Will you help me prepare, Professor?

Dimitri: How...was that? I perhaps did not offend as much as usual, but...I do not like our chances. 

Dimitri: I suppose I must practice diligently while I can. On my own. Away from prying eyes. 

Dedue: Will you teach me to dance?

Dedue: Was that satisfactory? 

Dedue: That makes things difficult. 

Felix: Here, help me practice my dancing. You forced me into this, so you're going to help me.

Felix: How did I get roped into this? 

Felix: Hmph! You irresponsible fiend. 

Ashe: I've been practicing as best as I can, Professor, but do you think you could give me a little help?

Ashe: Was that all right? I'm completely self-taught, so I really have no idea. 

Ashe: You really want to leave this all up to me? 

Sylvain: Oh, Professor! I'm glad you're here. I need help figuring out this whole...dancing thing. Mind helping me?

Sylvain: One and two and three and four... Got it! I'm pretty good at this.  

Sylvain: Aw, don't be like that, Professor. You chose me... You should help me win. 

Mercedes: Oh, Professor? Do you mind watching my dance routine? I would appreciate your honest opinion.

Mercedes: How was that? I hope it's good enough to win... 

Mercedes: I'm so sorry, I didn't realize you were busy. I didn't mean to distract you. 

Annette: Professor! Would you watch me dance really quick? I've been practicing a ton!

Annette: Mwahaha! Well? What do you think? I'd say I'm pretty great. Wouldn't you?  

Annette: Oh, do you have really important professor things to do? Well, let me know when you have the time! 

Ingrid: Professor, I admit--I have two left feet when it comes to dancing. Do you have time to give me any pointers?

Ingrid: How did I do? Was I awkward? I felt awkward. 

Ingrid: Perhaps some other time, then. Since you chose me, I'll need your guidance in all this. 



Claude: Teach, this is all your doing. Step up and take responsibility. You've got to help me practice my dance moves.

Claude: My legs aren't as unwieldy as before, I think... If I keep this up, I might do not terribly. 

Claude: You're too busy? Too busy to take responsibility for your actions? Wow. Well, you'd better make time for me before it's too late. 

Hilda: Hey, Professor! Care to join me for dance practice?

Hilda: Phew! I don't think we can possibly lose. Just you wait and see. 

Hilda: What, you've got something better to do than watch me practice? 

Lorenz: Rehearsals will not be necessary. But, if you insist, I can give you a small taste of what is to come.

Lorenz: Well, Professor? Are those not the most exquisitely refined moved you have ever witnessed? 

Lorenz: I assure you, dancing is fully ingrained in my being. Any further practice would be redundant. 

Raphael: Hey, Professor! You want to teach me some winning dance moves?

Raphael: That looked pretty good, right? I think I can win this thing! 

Raphael: If you think my moves are good enough, then I don't need dance lessons. 

Ignatz: Professor, can you watch me practice?

Ignatz: Is this how you do it? I'm feeling a little unsteady... 

Ignatz: Professor, don't abandon me in my time of need! Why'd you pick me in the first place?! 

Lysithea: Professor, can you supervise my dance rehearsal? If I'm going to do this, I want to win it.

Lysithea: Well? How was I? I figure if I dance with passion and fervor, I'll appear even more mature. 

Lysithea: You've chosen me, but you won't even bother to help me prepare? That's rather rude, Professor! 

Marianne: Did you need something, Professor? I suppose I should p-practice, right?

Marianne: No, no. That's no good. I can't seem to get a feel for it... 

Marianne: Oh. Very well. 

Leonie: Professor! Come join me for dance practice!

Leonie: I'm going to have to do this in front of a crowd? I can feel myself going pale already. 

Leonie: Hey, you're the one who put me up to this! The least you can do is give me a hand! 

Flayn: Yes? Do you need me for anything, Professor? I would be happy for some dancing guidance, should you have any!

Flayn: Thank you so much. I am eager to improve my dancing. 

Flayn: I see. Perhaps soon! 

@Dialogue 
Alois: Ladies and gentlemen! My sincerest apologies for the wait! Thank you for gathering here on the eve of the highly anticipated ball to bear witness to... The academy-wide dance competition! Welcome to the White Heron Cup!

Alois: The competition will be judged by...me! Your humble servant, Alois Rangeld! And also... The acclaimed former songstress of the Mittelfrank Opera Company, Manuela Casagranda!
Manuela: Yes, yes, thank you. Oh, and it should go without saying, but I swear to show no bias to my own house. Got it? Good.
Alois: Last but not least, the glamorous assassin who does all of her dancing in the dead of night...Shamir Nevrand!
Shamir: Hmph.
Alois: The three of us swear on our honor to judge the following proceedings with utmost impartiality and fairness! And with that, will the representatives of each house please make their way to the stage!

Alois: Contestants! Are you ready to dance? And is the band prepared to play? Very well... BEGIN!

Alois: TIME! That's all, folks! Splendid! All three of you were fantastic! Now, let's hear what the judges have to say...

Manuela: Oh my, let's see. I suppose I have no choice but to vote for...

Manuela: Oh my, let's see. I suppose I have no choice but to vote for...

Alois: Great feedback, both of you! Well then, let's see... Factoring my own humble opinion... Yes! We have a winner! And I will announce who it is...right now! Without any delay! The winner of this year's White Heron Cup is...

Edelgard: Well, a victory is a victory.

Hubert: I am not sure the judges are in their right minds...

Ferdinand: Haha! As expected of someone as accomplished as myself.

Linhardt: Oh? Well, just so long as nothing else is expected from me.

Caspar: I won? I won! How did I win?!

Bernadetta: Bernie? Are you sure? Heh...heh...

Dorothea: I wonder if I can use this to bolster my singing career...

Petra: Everywhere, dancing is dancing. This is the proof.

Dimitri: I won? There must be some mistake...

Dedue: Is this a joke?

Felix: Nonsense.

Ashe: Are you sure this is OK?

Sylvain: Heh heh heh! I knew I had it in me!

Mercedes: Oh, really? How lovely!

Annette: I did it! Go me!

Ingrid: Oh. Um. Sorry. I really didn't see this coming.

Claude: Ah, what a burden to be great at everything!

Hilda: Perfect! Where's the prize? There is a prize, right?

Lorenz: Haha! As expected!

Raphael: Me? Uh, really?

Ignatz: Can't say I had much confidence going in, but this is great!

Lysithea: Yes, it was the logical choice. My dancing was superior.

Marianne: Oh dear... This is a bit embarrassing.

Leonie: I can dance? Huh!

Flayn: Have I prevailed? Oh, most glorious! My practice was not in vain!

@Dialogue 
^start
Edelgard: The ball is tomorrow. I have no worthwhile memories of such events, yet I'm still looking forward to this one.
Hubert: As am I, in the sense that I look forward to destroying all of the unworthy suitors who will inevitably swarm Lady Edelgard.
Ferdinand: I will admit, Edelgard is adorable. However, when it comes to elegance on the dance floor, I am superior!
Dorothea: You're not a bad dancer, Ferdie. But you do have some moves that are...hard to watch.
Ferdinand: You honor me with your kind words! I understand that I am sometimes too dazzling to behold directly.
Linhardt: I'm envious of your positive attitude. I also know how to dance...in theory. Maybe I should participate as well.
Bernadetta: Not me! You wouldn't catch me dancing at a ball any sooner than you'd catch a fish swimming through the sky!
Caspar:  You do tend to flop around like a fish on the land, after all.
Bernadetta: Wh-why would you say that?! Now I feel like a fish on a skillet...
Linhardt: On a skillet... Hahaha! Ahem, never mind.
Caspar: Speaking of the ball, do we get to pick who we dance with? I wonder who I should ask...
Hubert: A bold subject change. Should Lady Edelgard wish it, I would be honored to...
Petra: I will fight with all that I have in me!
Dorothea: Fighting? No, that's not really the point...
Petra: I will not be as a fish upon the flame!
Dorothea:  Um... OK...
Edelgard: I have a proposition. Let's all agree to meet back at the monastery exactly five years from today.
Caspar: Like a class reunion? That's a great idea!
Hubert: Five years from today will be the millennium festival for Garreg Mach Monastery. I've heard the magnitude of the festivities will exceed all prior years.
Dorothea: Ooh, how exciting! Sounds like a great excuse to come visit our dear professor.
Petra: You will be seeing how much growing I have done. You will be pleased, Professor. This idea is good!
Edelgard: Who knows where each of us will be in five years' time...or who we will become. Still, I have faith that all of us will gather and celebrate our reunion.
Linhardt: That's assuming the professor is still here in five years...and not enjoying a cozy early retirement.
Edelgard: Even if that's the case, you will come, won't you? Whether or not you're still teaching here...
Byleth: Of course. 
Byleth: I will try.
Edelgard: Don't forget, my teacher. Even if the millennium festival should be canceled, I promise to return here...

Dimitri: This is the only ball of the year, and I see why. Everyone is absurdly excited...
Dedue: Your Highness, you sound so detached. We are all encouraged to enjoy the ball tomorrow.
Dimitri: Right you are, What a burden...
Felix: Huh. I never thought we'd see eye to eye, but I agree. I'd rather be swinging my blade than wasting my time with some girl at a ball.
Sylvain: Felix! Your Highness! You must be joking, right? This is our chance to dance with all of the ladies of the academy to our heart's content. You wish to throw away the best day of the whole year for sword practice? Insanity, I tell you!
Ashe: I'm pretty excited about the ball, myself. It's not like we get to do things like this very often.
Sylvain: Too true, Ashe. In fact, I'm gonna do you a favor and give you a crash course in chatting up girls. By tomorrow, you'll be an expert!
Ashe: Actually I'd much prefer if someone could just teach us how to dance...
Annette: Don't worry about the dancing part. I can teach you that, easy!
Mercedes: It's time for the ball! That warrants at least a tiny bit of makeup, don't you think, Ingrid? Just a smidge?
Ingrid: I...hmm. Maybe. I'll think about it.
Annette: It's settled! Tomorrow morning we'll meet up in Ingrid's room. Ooh, I can't wait!
Dimitri: Hahaha. You know... There's no telling where life will take us after we leave here. If only we could find a way to come together again, just like this...
Dedue: A fine notion, Your Highness. Perhaps five years from now?
Dimitri: Five years from now? Ah! That's when Garreg Mach Monastery will be holding the millennium festival.
Ingrid: By then we'll be addressing Your Highness as Your Majesty instead!
Sylvain: That's right. I suppose we all know it's coming, but by then you'll be far removed from us.
Dimitri: Come now. You know me better than that. My title may change, but I won't. And it won't just be me, you know. Five years from now, you'll all have your own stuffy positions to contend with. But as I understand it, the festivities at the millennium festival will be of a scale far beyond anything we've yet seen... In other words, the perfect excuse for us all to return here.
Annette: Ooh, a reunion? That sounds fun! I wouldn't miss it for the world!
Dimitri: I'd love for you to be there as well, Professor. After all, you're the heart of the Blue Lion House.
Byleth: I'll be there. 
Byleth: I'll try.
Dimitri: Good. Then it's settled. Of course...if something happens and I'm not able to attend, I'm leaving all of the logistics of organizing this reunion to you, Professor.
Byleth: You have to attend.
Mercedes: It's true! I'm sure being a king will keep you busy, but it's a bit early to be backing out of your own plans, don't you think?
Dimitri: Yes... I suppose you're right. I'm sorry. You have my word. I will return as well. Count on it.

Claude: The time has come for the annual ball. But first, an eve of merriment! OK, I'll admit it. The Officers Academy isn't as uptight as I thought.
Hilda: Ooh, I adore such things! Dancing is the only thing I'm really good at anyway.
Raphael: There's a feast tomorrow, isn't there? Isn't there?! Ah, I can't want a moment longer!
Leonie: Dancing, singing... I'm not good at either of those things.
Hilda: So? Dancing is fun! Oh! And remember, you can't dance with the same partner multiple times. It's tradition! That means you have to dance with all of the gentlemen in all of the houses, swapping dance partners as you please...
Lysithea: How scandalous. I, for one, plan to simply behold the pure essence of dance.
Marianne: I'll, um.... watch. From a distance.
Hilda: You can't just watch, Marianne! If a boy asks you to dance, you simply must accept. It's only polite.
Ignatz: You can ask...anyone? To dance? Gah, whatever should I do?
Lorenz: Hahaha! Lucky you, Ignatz! Tomorrow, if only for a day, you may live out your dearest dreams of an exalted existence! As for me, I am surely to be overwhelmed with the propositions of desperate ladies. I will doubtless have little time for partners of my own choosing.
Leonie: Which one of you is dreaming now, Lorenz?
Claude: Everyone! Listen up. To no one's surprise, I have a brilliant idea. Teach, you'll want in on this too.
Byleth: What's your idea?
Claude: This may sound impetuous. Perhaps irresponsible. Almost certainly impossible. But we're gonna do it anyway. In exactly five years' time, let's promise to meet again, right here at the monastery.
Raphael: A reunion? There's usually food at reunions. Count me in, Claude!
Marianne: Five years from now... will be the monastery's millennium festival, celebrating 1,000 years since the founding of Garreg Mach.
Ignatz: I hear the millennium festival will be the largest celebration in the monastery's history.
Hilda: Oh, I get it! It'll be easier for us to all get back here with the millennium festival as an excuse.
Lorenz: How true. As the new leader of the Alliance, I will certainly have the occasion to attend and pay my respects to Lady Rhea.
Lysithea: That almost certainly will not transpire.
Claude: And you, Teach? I guess it's hard to imagine that you'll still be teaching here five years from now... But I'm sure no matter where you end up, you'll come running at the chance to see your adorable little Golden Deer again, right?
Byleth: I don't know.
Claude: Who knew Teach had a heart of ice? Too bad I can see from a mile away that you're joking. How you really feel is written all over your face.
Byleth: Probably so.
Claude: Ahem... That was your cue to promise everyone you'll return. Go on, set a good example, Teach. If you promise, everyone else will, too.
Lysithea: Hahaha! I'm already excited! After five years, we'll all be whoever we're going to become!
Leonie: Please, Professor! Invite Captain Jeralt too! I want to show him how well his apprentice turns out.
Hilda: It's settled, then. What do you say, Claude? Is it official?
Claude: The promise is sealed! That means we're all obligated to keep it. Five years from today, all of us will meet again at the monastery. Don't forget it, Teach. You and I will meet here again...

@Dialogue 
Sothis: Running away? I understand. You hardly had the time to breathe in there. It must be hard to be the favorite teacher at the ball! Poor, poor Professor!
Byleth: I am not everyone's favorite...
Sothis: Was that a joke? I find it hard to tell with you. Just think of all the students begging you to dance!
Byleth: It is difficult. 
Sothis: So you do think you're the favorite! I might have known.
Sothis: But where is there to run? This place is filled with joyful students looking for a dance.

Sothis: Ah... I see. The Goddess Tower waits for you...

Edelgard: Ah, here you are. Are you waiting for someone?
Byleth: I'm not waiting for anyone.
Edelgard: Good. I would not wish to interrupt anything.
Byleth: I was waiting for you.
Edelgard:  For me? Well, you should have summoned me earlier. Regardless, here I am.
Byleth: Has something happened?
Edelgard: No, nothing in particular. In fact, that's why I came here. This place, the Goddess Tower... It was special to my parents. My father attended the Officers Academy himself. A few years after graduating, he was crowned emperor. One day, during a visit to the monastery, he snuck into the Goddess Tower on a nostalgic whim. And there she was, my mother. She had just enrolled in the academy that very year. They were instantly drawn to each other. Love at first sight, you could say. It was the first time either had truly been in love... or so the story goes.
Byleth: Their first love?
Edelgard: Yes. Of course, as emperor, my father had already married for political reasons. As the Empire demands many heirs, he also had numerous other lovers. In the end, my mother settled for becoming one of his many consorts. But I choose to believe there was genuine love between them. Heh, I suppose it's a silly story to cling to.
Byleth: It's a lovely story.
Edelgard: Isn't it? It's a shame that the lovely stories ended after I was born. For as long as I can remember, my mother had already been exiled from the capital. It's strange. Something about you makes me reveal all of the things I so carefully keep concealed.
Byleth: Who was your first true love?
Edelgard: Hmmm. For some reason, I feel compelled to tell you all of these things I have kept hidden. I can't say the name, but it was a noble who I met in the Kingdom, a lifetime ago.
Edelgard: Anyway... What about you? It's your turn to reveal some long-held secret! You can share a story about your past...or perhaps tell me about your first love.
Byleth: I have no such stories
Edelgard: You're telling the truth. I can tell. Hm... I wasn't even able to make you blush.
Byleth: Please don't ask that of me.
Edelgard: You realize that just makes me more curious than ever!
Byleth: Sorry...
Edelgard: Heh... No, I'm the one who should apologize. It wasn't my intention to pry. I'm just intrigued by you and your mysterious past. You have supposedly always been a mercenary, but I believe there is more to your story than that... Let's leave it there for today and return to the ball. There must be plenty of students hoping to talk with you...and to dance with you. I would not wish to prevent you from mingling. I cannot keep you all to myself, after all.

Hubert: Here for a tryst, Professor? I wonât interfere. I shall take my leave at once. Farewell.
Byleth: Just a moment.
Hubert: Yes, what is it? I assume you are waiting on someone.
Byleth: What do you mean, a tryst?
Hubert: You have arranged to meet someone here at the Goddess Tower, have you not?
Byleth: No, not at all.
Hubert: I see. Apologies for the misunderstanding. Then I take it you are unfamiliar with the rumors about this place?
Byleth: What rumors?
Hubert: There is an old legend that says promises made between lovers here are sure to be fulfilled. If you believe in that sort of thing. I would have expected you to be familiar with the story already, considering how popular you are. I was certain that someone had asked you here.
Byleth: I am not that popular.
Hubert: On the contrary, I suspect those who wished to ask were simply too daunted to try.
Byleth: That is not the case.
Hubert: No need to sound so dejected. I suspect those who wished to ask were simply too daunted to try.
Hubert: But thanks to their cowardice, I am gifted with this opportunity to speak with you. Itâs clear you have never felt at ease around me, as a result of how little trust there is between us. I should get back to the ball, regardless. I imagine there would be quite a scene if you turned out to be lying.
Byleth: You donât believe me?
Hubert: Trust is not in my nature. Good night.


Ferdinand: Hello, Professor. I just needed a quick break from the festivities. Fancy running into you here.
Byleth: You followed me, didn't you?
Ferdinand: I beg your pardon?! Absolutely not! It is simply a coincidence. The heir to the great house of Aegir, chasing after a woman in the dead of night! The very thought of it!
Byleth: What a nice coincidence.
Ferdinand: Yes, a coincidence...
Ferdinand: Anyway, seeing you here, I cannot help but recall the legend of the Goddess Tower. It is said that when a man and a woman meet here by chance on the night of the ball, their paths become one. The goddess blesses them and ensures a harmonious union.
Byleth: I heard it differently.
Ferdinand: Oh, you heard the legend too? How was it different? That the goddess is sure to grant any promises made here? Ah, perhaps that is how it goes, come to think of it.
Byleth: Are you sure that's the legend?
Ferdinand: Indeed, that is how it goes. Or at least, that is the version I heard.
Ferdinand: How long have we known each other now? About nine months, by my count. The passage of time is swift indeed. Listen. I need to tell you something. After I graduate, I must pass stern judgement on my father. His greed got the better of him. He has strayed far from the righteous path. As the next Duke Aegir, I will succeed him as prime minister, and it will fall to me to hold him accountable. Only then can I justly guide the Empire's subjects and work to create a better world. That is my dream, my will, and my future. I pray that I will have the courage to fulfill my solemn duty and that I will have your support.
Byleth: Of course. I'm with you.
Byleth: I'm always happy to listen.
Ferdinand: Thank you. Knowing that you are on my side, I feel unstoppable. Well, shall we head back? Plenty of people must be wonder where you went. Specifically the legions of men who would like to dance with you! To be honest, I count myself among them.

Linhardt: Professor, you're late.
Byleth: What do you mean?
Linhardt: To tell the truth, it was an act of sheer hope that I might find you here.
Byleth: We didn't have plans to meet.
Linhardt: True, but a young man can hope to accidentally bump into someone.
Byleth: Oh, sorry! 
Linhardt: My apologies, Professor. It was a bit of a joke. Iâve been waiting here because I thought you might come by.
Linhardt: I'm glad to find I was right. I hoped to find you so I might ask... Well, I would very much like to research your Crest.
Byleth: Not right now. 
Linhardt: Does that mean you might be interested eventually? Let's decide the place and time right now, then. What? Is that not acceptable?
Byleth: Why would I let you do that?
Linhardt: Because it would be terribly interesting?
Linhardt: Anyway... Have you heard the legend of this place, Professor? It's a sentimental one to be sure. The story goes that if two people share a vow at the Goddess Tower, they'll be bound together forever. Hm, or was it that they'll be cursed forever? One or the other for certain. All the same, I think it's a rather lovely legend.
Byleth: It doesn't sound that lovely to me.
Byleth: Tell me more.
Linhardt: Well, I suppose it does depend on your enjoyment of potentially mistranslated myths. Professor, be warned. This may seem forward of me... However, let's vow that one day I will be allowed to research your Crest as much as I please.
Byleth: I think not.
Byleth: Excuse me?
Linhardt: I've overstepped my bounds again, haven't I? It's just that today is such a special day and, well, I suppose I got caught up in all the excitement. How about this instead? Let's agree to meet here again one day, just the two of us.
Byleth: If the opportunity arises.
Linhardt: Such an opportunity won't just arise, we have to make it happen for ourselves. I look forward to that day.
Byleth: I agree. 
Linhardt: I look forward to that day. I really do...

Caspar: Hey, Professor! I was looking all over for you. What are you doing up here? I think this place is supposed to be off-limits...
Byleth: I didn't know.
Caspar: Well, that's the official rule. I don't think anyone follows it though.
Byleth: If it's only supposed to be...
Caspar: Heh! Good point. No one follows that rule anyway, and I heard no one from the monastery really cares.
Byleth: Where did you hear that?
Caspar: Huh. I can't remember her name. It was just some girl who started talking to me last night. She was trying to get me to leave the ball tonight and go to the Goddess Tower with her. She wouldn't say what she wanted to do here though. Said it was a secret or something. I told her I'd be too busy dancing and stuffing my face with food, so she left. Don't know why, but she didn't seem too happy about it. I guess I was curious though, so I came to check it out. That's when I saw you walking this way, so I followed you in.
Byleth: That's just awful.
Caspar: Isn't it? She wouldn't explain herself and she got angry!
Byleth: I was referring to you.
Byleth: I can't help but feel sympathetic.
Caspar: I appreciate that, but I'm not really looking for sympathy. I just wish she would've explained herself before getting all angry.
Byleth: My sympathy was not for you.
Caspar: Huh? Why? Well, it's all over now. Can't change what's in the past.
Byleth: I like your positive attitude.
Caspar: Thanks! I had a feeling you'd get it.
Byleth: Maybe you should worry about the past a little.
Caspar: Ugh. Really? I just don't like to dwell... But if you say so, I could keep it in mind.
Caspar: Anyway, I'm going to head back to the ball. You coming? Doesn't look like there's anything too exciting going on here.
Byleth: Let's head back.
Caspar: Maybe coming to the tower wasn't a total waste of time. I got to talk to you at least, right?
Byleth: I'm going to stay.
Caspar: All right. Don't stay too long though. You might catch cold.
Caspar: Welp, I'm starting to get hungry again. Time to fill up on some more food!

Bernadetta:  Ah! Wh-what's that?! Ghost?! Is it a ghost?! Don't eat me!
Byleth: Calm down, it's OK.
Bernadetta: It'll eat the skin right off my bones and no one will everâ Huh? Oh, it's you, Professor. What a relief.
Byleth: It's just your professor.
Bernadetta: I knew it! I said, Bernie, this place is haunted, you'll just get eaten by the ghost of some dusty old professor orâ Oh. Oh, it's you.
Byleth: You can relax now.
Bernadetta: Right. I'm better now. Thanks. But try not to scare me like that again, please... With the ball happening tonight, I was sure there wouldn't be anyone here. And from far off, you look... Well, you kinda have a spooky silhouette. I guess you haven't heard the legend?
Byleth: Legend?
Bernadetta: Oh, so if a couple swears a vow on the night of the ball, the goddess grants their wish? That's amazing! Is it true? I guess that's the sort of thing you miss when you spend all your time avoiding people. But wouldn't it be nice to spend some time alone with a nice guy in this lonely tower, cut off from all the rest of the world? Anyway... Oh, Professor! Since you're here and all, could I ask you for a favor? As you probably know by now, it's my lifelong dream to live in solitude forever... So could you help me to swear that vow?
Byleth: Nice try.
Bernadetta: Saw right through me, huh?
Byleth: I can't promise that.
Bernadetta: Guess you're right. It probably wouldn't work out so well for me, would it?
Bernadetta: Ah, well. No use complaining. Actually, I'm happy I got to see you here tonight. Even if it was just by coincidence. Would you mind staying a little longer? It's nice and quiet, and the sky's really pretty. I quite like the atmosphere. On a night like this, being out in the open doesn't seem so bad...

Dorothea: Ah, Professor! You showed up!
Byleth: Why are you here?
Dorothea: Um, I'm the one who called you here, remember?
Byleth: Why do you look so happy?
Dorothea: Well, because you're here, of course!
Dorothea: You came here because you read the letter I sent you, right?
Byleth: Not that I recall...
Byleth: What letter?
Dorothea: Are you saying this is...a coincidence? How disappointing to think you didn't come here specifically to see me. Still, if we're meeting by complete chance... that has a certain appeal too. It's as if destiny brought us together! And tonight is the night of the ball... Lucky me.
Byleth: What are you plotting?
Dorothea: Plotting? That's a bit rude, don't you think?
Byleth: I thought you weren't comfortable around me...
Dorothea: Oh, that's just when you're looking through me in front of others. When it's just us...I kind of like it.
Dorothea: Originally, I wanted to see what you'd do when you read my letter. I just wanted to see if you'd come here like I asked. I had a feeling that you would. Though, I suppose you didn't even read the letter to begin with... I should just be thankful I wasn't left here waiting. All alone. Forever. Do you know it's been almost nine whole moons since you arrived at Garreg Mach? You must have found a special someone by now, haven't you, Professor?
Byleth: I have.
Dorothea: Ooh? Who could it be? You've made me so curious. Oh, don't worry. I'm not going to pry if you don't want to share. Your private life is private, after all.
Byleth: I have not.
Dorothea: Uh-huh, right. I bet you're just hiding it. There's someone you're sweet on... Don't you worry, I won't pry if you don't want to share. These things are private, after all.
Byleth: Is that what you wanted to talk about?
Dorothea: Are you changing the subject? Don't do that. Ohh, I bet that means you do have someone, don't you? Don't you worry, I won't pry if you don't want to share. These things are private, after all.
Dorothea: Well, I oughta get going... I wouldn't want to be in the way if your special someone shows up. Either way, I do hope you'll share a dance with me later.

Petra: Professor, what is bringing you here? Is the ball not enjoyable?
Byleth: I had to escape.
Petra: Escape? I thought the ball was for dancing, not fighting... Oh! Escape! Meaning...to leave. I have understanding.
Byleth: I wanted to see you. 
Petra: But you are seeing me every day. Why would you be wanting to see me now? Maybe you and I share a reason for being here...
Byleth: I'm lost.
Petra: Lost? But this monastery is where our home is... I am not understanding.
Petra: I have been hearing about a legend. About the Goddess Tower. People have a belief that the goddess watches this place on this night. If you share a promise, the goddess will make that promise become true. That makes men and women who are close come to this place. On this night. I am wanting to see that, and so I came to observe. With secrecy. But no one is here. I have much disappointment.
Byleth: I wanted to see that too. 
Petra: Someone might arrive still. We could go find a hiding spot for both of us. We may have to be squished with each other, but I will not be worried if you are not.
Byleth: You shouldn't spy on people.
Petra: Yes, that has truth. I will be thinking about that from now on.
Petra: Oh! I have a realization! If someone sees us here with each other, they will think that we are with each other! That is not accepting...acceptable for people to misunderstand!
Byleth: That could be a problem.
Petra: We should be returning to the ball, separately.
Byleth: I wouldn't mind. 
Petra: Is that OK, Professor? I think we are agreeing on that. Maybe we should be returning to the ball... with each other.

Dimitri: It's quiet here, isn't it, Professor? That reminds me. Do you know the legend associated with the Goddess Tower?
Byleth: I've heard it.
Dimitri: Is that right? You don't strike me as the sort to enjoy stories like that.
Byleth: I'm not concerned with such things.
Dimitri: Just as expected.
Dimitri: They say that wishes made in this tower will come true. I wonder who came up with such a silly notion.
Byleth: You don't believe it?
Dimitri: Legends are legends, nothing more. I doubt there are many who really believe that wishes can be granted. The goddess just watches over us from above... That is all. No matter how hard someone begs to be saved, she would never so much as offer her hand. And even if she did, we lack the means to reach out and grasp it. That's how I feel about her. In any case... I suppose there's no harm in passing the time with silly legends. What do you say, Professor? Care to make a wish? We are here on the night of the ball. Why don't you try wishing for something?
Byleth: After you.
Byleth: I can't think of anything, so go ahead.
Dimitri: A wish of my own... I suppose my wish...is for a world in which no one would ever be unjustly taken from us. Or...something along those lines.
Byleth: That's a great wish.
Byleth: I'll wish for the same.
Dimitri: Thank you, Professor. Although, at a time like this... Perhaps it would make more sense for me to wish that we'll be together forever. What do you think?
Byleth: ...
Dimitri: ... Haha! Well now, Professor! You must admit I've improved in the art of joke telling.
Byleth: That's cruel.
Byleth: It didn't sound like a joke.
Dimitri: I'm sorry... I guess that was rather thoughtless of me. ... Honestly... I do regret saying such a thing. Please think nothing of it. I've blurted out irresponsible things like that to my classmates. Promises that we'll see each other again and the like. I have no business making such promises for the future. There are certain things that I must accomplish, even if it means risking my life. I may not even have a future to promise to someone.
Byleth: ...
Dimitri: We should head back soon. It's rude of me to keep you all to myself. Shall we, Professor?

Dedue: What are you doing here?
Byleth: I could ask you the same.
Byleth: I needed some quiet.
Dedue: I felt similarly.
Dedue: Though I elected to attend this ball, I did not know what to do with myself once there. I do not wish to be a nuisance to His Highness or to my classmates. Thus, I have sought solitude. I noticed a number of people looking for you, however. Should you not return to the festivities?
Byleth: Iâd like to stay here a bit longer.
Byleth: Not just yet.
Dedue: As you wish.
Dedue: ...
Byleth: ...
Dedue: The stars seem brighter here, somehow. I have heard the goddess of FÃ³dlan grants a special blessing at this tower. The blessing ensures that any oath sworn between man and woman here shall be fulfilled. That is what I have heard. We had similar legends in Duscur. Some elements of human culture are universal, I suppose. Is there an oath you would like to swear?
Byleth: Not that I can think of.
Dedue: I understand.
Byleth: I swear to work toward peace for FÃ³dlan.
Dedue: I am not sure that a full and lasting peace is possible.
Dedue: But while I have this opportunity, permit me to swear an oath to you. I swear that we will look upon these same stars again, when His Highness has led us to a more tranquil age.
Byleth: That is a worthy oath.
Byleth: I look forward to it.
Dedue: Good. There is a chill in the air, is there not? I am accustomed to cold weather. But you should go back indoors.
Byleth: Letâs go back together.
Dedue: If you wish. I suppose the damage to your reputation for being seen with me has already been done.
Byleth: Will you share a dance with me?
Dedue: I do not know how to dance. If you wish to teach me, then I will endeavor to learn.
Dedue: Let us return. If the cold is too much, I will lend you my coat.

Felix: Oh, look who it is.
Byleth: What are you doing here?
Felix: I just wanted some quiet. It's so loud, I needed a little respite.
Byleth: Are you waiting for someone?
Felix: No. I just wanted a bit of quiet.
Felix: Besides, what are you doing here?
Byleth: I thought I might find you here.
Felix: Huh? You must be joking.
Byleth: I'm here for the same reason as you.
Felix: Ah. Well, I guess it figures.
Felix: Hm. Have you heard the legend of the Goddess Tower? That if you make a pledge, it will be fulfilled? Childish, I know. But if it were true... Let's make a pledge to the goddess. I pledge that someday, I will surpass you. I'll surpass your technique, your skill with the sword, and your cunning as a warrior. Then I will make you taste defeat!
Byleth: That seems extreme.
Byleth: That's your pledge to the goddess?
Felix: What a disappointment. If you're looking for a passionate affair, you've got the wrong man. Go find someone else. I've spent my life avoiding love and romance. They're distractions. Blades, blood, and battle. That's what I'm made of and nothing else. If someone saw us, however, this may look like an amorous meeting. You'll have to settle for being mistaken as my lover.
Byleth: That's mean.
Byleth: What nonsense.
Felix: It's time I went back to training. I'll always be more comfortable holding a sword than a woman's hand. Try not to catch a cold up here. I'd hate for such a good sparring partner to be out of commission. Good-bye.

Ashe: Professor! Did you come up here for a rest too?
Byleth: Thatâs right.
Ashe: I guess we think along the same lines. I was feeling kind of worn out.
Byleth: Actually, I was looking for you.
Ashe: For me? Oh! Iâm so sorry to put you out of your way! I was just kind of worn out from all of the excitement. I am enjoying the ball, but itâs a bit much, you know?
Ashe: Everyone else seems used to this kind of thing, but Iâve never been to anything like it before. My friends did teach me a bit about proper manners and how to dance, but I still feel out of place. Stepping on girlsâ feet, messing up the pretty floral decorations... Haha, Iâve been a bit of a disaster. Sometimes I wonder if itâs even right for someone like me to be in a place like this.
Byleth: I feel that way sometimes too.
Ashe: Really? You do? Thatâs kind of reassuring!
Byleth: You have every right to be here.
Ashe: You're right, of course. I'm a student at the Officers Academy, just like everyone else. Lonato was kind enough to send me here. I need to live up to his expectations.
Ashe: By the way, have you heard the stories about the Goddess Tower? They say that if a man and a woman make a wish together here, the goddess will make it come true.
Byleth: What would you wish for?
Ashe: Oh, never mind me. I'd like to know what you'd wish for!
Byleth: Letâs make a wish together, then.
Ashe: My thoughts exactly! Do you have anything in particular youâd like to wish for?
Byleth: My wish is...
Ashe: Your wish is?
Byleth: For your wish to come true, Ashe.
Ashe: What? My wish? W-well, um...let me think.
Byleth: I canât think of anything.
Ashe: Well, if you can't come up with anything, maybe I should think of a wish instead?
Ashe: All right, Iâve got it. I wish for my brother and sister back home to be able to live out their lives in peace.
Byleth: Thatâs just like you.
Byleth: Thatâs a lovely wish.
Ashe: This kind of thing is pretty embarrassing, huh? Maybe I should be heading back. Iâll never get better at fancy social events like this if I keep running away from them, right? I guess I should ask another girl to dance. Oh, but Iâd better make sure I go over the steps again first.
Byleth: You could dance with me.
Ashe: Really? Youâd do that? Wow, thatâd be great! Just promise not to laugh if I mess it up, OK? Come on. Letâs head back.

Sylvain: Evening, Professor. Lovely night, isnât it? Just look at those stars... I heard you were headed over to the Goddess Tower, and I got curious about who you might be meeting. But here you are all by yourself. This isnât a loverâs tryst at all! Heh heh...
Byleth: Tryst?
Sylvain: Oh, yeah. The Goddess Tower is where lovers meet. Didnât anybody tell you? They say that if you exchange vows here, they always come true. Itâs a sacred place for lovers.
Byleth: Why are you here alone?
Byleth: Where is your lover?
Sylvain: Well, the person Iâm interested in...is already here. Youâre here alone. Iâm here alone. I was thinking maybe...
Byleth: Wait. Me?
Sylvain: Well, of course! Weâre the only two people here, arenât we? I keep thinking about it, and it just makes sense. My Crest and yours...
Byleth: Thatâs too much, too soon.
Byleth: Marry you? I canât even trust you.
Sylvain: Heh, OK. True, true. You know, Iâve never regretted any of my past behavior...until you turned me down just now. I canât be who Iâve been my whole life. I gotta get it together and become a man you can trust. I know that sounds like another one of my games, but itâs true. Iâll prove it to you. Anyway, Iâm going to head back to the ball. Since weâre both here, would you accompany me?
Byleth: Iâll go back with you.
Sylvain: Well then, my lady, I do hope youâll give me the honor of a dance. It will be good practice for our first dance at our wedding reception. Heh hehâIâm kidding!
Byleth: Iâm going to stay here for awhile.
Sylvain: It's chilly out tonight, so take care not to catch cold. And if you do get cold, you know where to find me. Sorry. Old habits die hard, I guess... OK. Well, I'm headed inside.
Sylvain: Anyway... Letâs get going before you change your mind.

Mercedes: Why, Professor! I was wondering where you ran off to. I searched the entire floor but couldn't find you anywhere. Tired, are we? I can tell by that look on your face. It must be exhausting being so popular, huh?
Byleth: I'm exhausted...
Mercedes: I can imagine. Shall we take a break here, then? Say, Professor. Have you heard the legend of the Goddess Tower? They say that if two people exchange a vow here, the goddess herself will fulfill it.
Byleth: I've never heard that before.
Mercedes: Well, that simply won't do. You'll fall behind if you can't keep up with your students!
Byleth: I think I recall such a story.
Mercedes: Ah, so even you have heard that one. The stories must travel far.
Mercedes: Many young couples come here in private, all thanks to that legend. They make promises to stay together forever. Things like that. I actually saw a man invite a lady to join him at the tower while on my way here. It's rather romantic, don't you think?
Byleth: I think so.
Mercedes: Indeed.
Byleth: I disagree.
Mercedes: Really? You're a strange one, Professor.
Mercedes: Though, just because two people share a promise, that doesn't guarantee they'll be together forever. You've noticed many nobles at the academy, right? They very rarely have the freedom to choose their own partners. Yet still they wish to stay together. Maybe that's why they pray to the goddess. Are you waiting on anyone, Professor?
Byleth: No, there's no one.
Mercedes: What a relief. I was afraid that I was keeping you.
Byleth: I was waiting for you.
Mercedes: Oh my. Even though we didn't make plans to meet? You're a charmer, aren't you?
Mercedes: Ah! I almost forgot why I came looking for you! I was wondering if you'd like to dance with me. It's just so loud in the reception hall though. I think I'd rather stay here with you... If that's all right with you, Professor. Thank you. I appreciate it.

Annette: Professor! I'm happy to see you here. Everybody's been asking about you. You're really popular with the students.
Byleth: I had to escape.
Byleth: I'm worn out.
Annette: Oh, really? Huh. Uh, actually, I've been trying to find you too. But if you're not interested in dancing, that's OK. We are supposed to be at a ball thought... If you're not going to dance tonight, when and where will you get another chance?
Byleth: Here.
Byleth: Now.
Annette: Wait...really? There isn't any music... But this is too special to pass up! Maybe...I could sing a little something. I may not look like it, but I'm a practiced singer. Though...people do tend to think my lyrics are a little odd. âª Fry the food, it tastes so good... It fills up our hungry tummies... âª
Byleth: Now I'm hungry.
Byleth: What an interesting song.
Annette: It's about this yummy stew one of the monks taught me to make a while back. Oh, I know! I'll make it for you! It really is just about the tastiest thing in the world. Um... If I'm bothering you, please tell me now and I'll leave you alone.
Byleth: ...
Annette: Say, Professor... Did you know that if you make a wish here at the Goddess Tower, it will for sure come true? That's why people usually meet up with someone they like here. For a rendezvous! And they make a wish that they'll stay together forever. So... Uh, I thought you might be waiting for a girl here. And that I'm messing it up.
Byleth: I've never heard about that tradition.
Byleth: Nothing of the sort.
Annette: Hehe, that's just what I'd expect you to say! But since we're already here, let's go ahead and made a wish together.
Byleth: What kind of wish?
Byleth: Sure.
Annette: I've already decided what it will be. Dearest Goddess... I wish for the professor and I to always be the best of friends! How's that sound? Can we wish for that?
Byleth: I'd be happy to.
Annette: Really? That makes me so happy!
Byleth: It's a little embarrassing...
Annette: Oh no! Actually, when I said it aloud, I could tell it was an embarrassing wish... Oops!
Annette: Well, I'd better be going now, and you should think about returning to the ball too. But make sure you save me a dance!

Ingrid: Whew, I can't manage one more bite. So full... So full!
Ingrid: Oh! Professor! What do you think you're doing here?! I came here to stuff my faâI mean to have some ME time.
Byleth: I sort of followed you...
Ingrid: You mean you saw that just now? All the food? Everything?! Ugh, so embarrassing... Maybe there's a nearby rock I can crawl under.
Byleth: No reason, really.
Ingrid: Oh, so we're just running into one another by chance, then. Phew. If you had followed me here, I'd be a little...bothered. And probably embarrassed.
Byleth: Were you waiting for someone?
Ingrid: Who, me? No, no, of course not. I was just about to walk off all that food I just ate. Really, I came here to have some privacy. But you're here now, so I suppose that makes it a bit less private.
Byleth: Are you worried people may get the wrong idea?
Ingrid: I suppose there's that possibility, now that you mention it.
Byleth: Just the two of us...
Ingrid: Uh...well, yes. I suppose it's just us here...
Ingrid: Does that concern you too, Professor? I'm happy to return to the reception hall.
Byleth: It's not terribly concerning, really.
Ingrid: Of course. Nothing to see here! I'm happy to keep walking off this food, in that case. Ah, the stars certainly are beautiful tonight, hm? It's peaceful, looking up at them together, don't you think? Maybe we can do it again sometime.
Byleth: I'd love to come along.
Ingrid: If we return from here together, I worry that people would start unsavory rumors about us. I don't concern myself with gossip, but I'd hate for it to mar your reputation in any way. Are you certain? Fair enough. Let's head back, then.

Claude: Oh. Hey, Teach. What brings you to the Goddess Tower? You know what, never mind. The answer is as clear as day. You couldn't bear the ball anymore and simply had to escape.
Byleth: I wouldn't say that...
Byleth: I just needed a break.
Claude: There's nothing wrong with admitting you're not comfortable in a noisy crowd. Really, I get it. I'm the same way.
Byleth: I don't believe it.
Claude: Ha! See right through me, do you? But I really do mean it. Parties aren't for me. Music and fun are all well and good, but those dances the nobles do are...something else. I was never really taught to do that sort of thing. My upbringing was...lacking in certain ways.
Byleth: Even though you're from a noble family?
Byleth: Even though you're heir to the Alliance?
Claude: Even so. I may have secured a fancy new title, but who I am on the inside... Well, status alone can't change that. That's a bit of an aside, though. Say, Teach... have you heard the legends about this tower? They say if a man and a woman pray for the same thing here, on this night, the goddess will grant their wish without fail.
Byleth: Why tonight?
Claude: Who knows? Maybe it has something to do with celebrating the anniversary of the monastery's completion. Maybe the goddess comes down from above on this night and this night alone to celebrate with us. Even goddesses like to party, right? The truth is that it's just a legend the students here like to tell. It's not based on any real facts. But I suppose it would be a waste to pass up a chance of having our wish granted. What do you say, Teach? Care to try?
Byleth: What would we pray for?
Claude: Hm... Let's see... How about we pray for our ambitions to come true? You don't exactly seem like the selfish type, but even you must have an ambition or two.
Byleth: I do.
Byleth: I do not.
Byleth: More of a hope...
Claude: That's what I thought. It's the same for everyone.
Claude: Even if you're not aware of it, I'm sure there's something your heart of hearts wishes for.
Claude: That's what I thought. It's the same for everyone.
Claude: No one is ever completely satisfied. Everyone has something they long for. Otherwise, what's the point of it all? Of course, same goes for me. Without even realizing it, I found myself holding tight to some pretty big ambitions. If you would... I would love for you to share in those ambitions with me, Teach.
Claude: But all that aside, let's get started. Let's pray to the goddess before she tuckers out for the evening. OK... Here goes. Oh, divine Goddess! Hear our prayers! We beseech you and your radiance! Please, grant us that which we seek!
Claude: Huh. I think that should do it. The goddess'll make our dreams come true now, yeah?
Byleth: I wonder.
Claude: At any rate, we've done all we can. Whether we actually believe our dreams will come true or not is up to us.
Claude: I suppose we should head back soon. I'm sure everyone is looking for you. Just promise to spare a dance for me. OK, Teach? I swear, so long as it's not one of those goofy noble dances, I am a treasure on the dance floor!

Lorenz: Ah. There you are, Professor. I didnât see you at the ball. I was wondering where youâd slipped off to. Everyone is waiting for you. Shouldnât you be heading back?
Byleth: Momentarily.
Byleth: No, Iâd like to stay here.
Lorenz: Well, thereâs no need to hurry. The ball will continue a while longer. Was the noise becoming too much? It must be difficult, if you are unaccustomed to high society. I say that, but Iâm actually the same. After a while of excitement, I yearn for peace and quiet.
Byleth: Did someone turn you down?
Lorenz: Professor! Rude! Just what do you think of me? There are definitely students in there making the most of things. Flirting as if their very lives depended on it. But for a catch such as myself, every day is an opportunity. Thereâs no need to appear desperate. Still, itâs unexpected that the two of us would be here together, isnât it?
Byleth: Why is that?
Lorenz: Do you not know the legend of this place? The goddess is said to grant a special kind of blessing, unique to the day of this ball. It is said that on this day she will honor any vow sworn between man and woman here at this tower. Itâs a famous legend amongst the students, which may be why I expected to find more of them here.
Byleth: So, you came here to spy on people?
Lorenz: Of course not! I would never stoop to such despicable behavior! Honestly, I forgot all about the legend until now. Iâm not interested in that sort of foolishness. Though I suppose it couldnât hurt to test it. Even if it is only a legend. What do you say, Professor? Shall we swear some sort of vow together? Something that will benefit the both of us. What dream should we promise to make a reality?
Byleth: Peace for all.
Byleth: Happiness for the two of us.
Lorenz: Thatâs very fitting. I will remember that we made this vow here today. Well, I should head back. Lest, by my absence, the festivities lose their luster.

Raphael:  Omm... Mmm... Mmm... Huh? Whoâs there?!
Raphael: P-Professor! Is the ball over already? What, uh... What are you doing here?
Byleth: Just taking a break.
Raphael: Ah, a break. Sure, sure. That's uh... That's what I'm doing too.
Byleth: I heard a strange noise.
Raphael: Strange noise? No need to worry! Iâll, uh... Iâll look into it for you!
Raphael: Huh. I suddenly have the energy to dance! Maybe Iâll head back to the ball.
Byleth: What were you eating?
Raphael: Ah! You noticed. It was just some meat. It was a much nicer cut than Iâm used to. We all got one helping, but some people didnât want theirs! Can you believe it? I hate to see good food go to waste. Iâm sorry, Professor.
Byleth: You should be.
Byleth: You need to follow the rules.
Raphael: Youâre right. I know... Oh! By the way! I heard something on my way here. I heard that if two people make a wish together in this tower, on this night, the goddess will grant it!
Byleth: Two people?
Raphael: I donât know the specifics, just that you canât do it alone. There has to be two of you. Since weâre both here now, letâs make a wish together! What should we wish for? More delicious cuts of meat?
Raphael: No? Then how about bigger muscles?
Raphael: What else is there to wish for? Hm! Me becoming a proper knight? But thatâs just for me, not you...
Byleth: We can wish for that. 
Raphael: We can? Professor! Thatâs so generous of you!
Raphael: Now that we wished for it, Iâm sure Iâll become a proper knight!
Byleth: Letâs wish for peace in FÃ³dlan.
Raphael: Peace in FÃ³dlan? That's a good wish too!
Raphael: I really hope our wish comes true.

Ignatz: ...
Ignatz: Gah! Is that you, Goddess?! Professor! Ah. Iâm sorry, I thought you were the goddess.
Byleth: Thatâs ridiculous.
Ignatz: Youâre right, youâre right. Imagine, if she just appeared out of nowhere! Do you know of that old legend, Professor?
Byleth: Old legend?
Ignatz: Yes. Itâs said that if a man and a woman make a vow tonight at the Goddess Tower... She will appear before them and bless them, ensuring that vowâs fulfillment.
Byleth: Ridiculous.
Ignatz: I know, but can you imagine if she just appeared out of nowhere? Still... Maybe, even if we canât see her, we can sense her presence. I envision the goddess as the most beautiful creature in the world... More beautiful than any landscape, any artwork. Utterly beyond compare. Thatâs what I think anyway. Or perhaps, what I hope. Since I first heard that legend, Iâve wanted to try it and perhaps meet the goddess.
Byleth: But if the legendâs true...
Ignatz: Yes, I know what youâre getting at. She would never appear before a single person. Frankly, I didnât know any girls well enough to invite them here. So I was hoping a couple would come along, and I could sneak a peek... Wait! That came out wrong! I take that back. I have absolutely no intention of peeking!
Byleth: Shall we make a vow?
Ignatz: What? You and...me? I suppose we do fit the criteria, but are you certain you would want to do that?
Ignatz: In that case, letâs try it! What should our vow be? Please, pick whatever sounds best to you!
Byleth: Peace for FÃ³dlan.
Ignatz: Of course. Might be a little ambitious, but letâs give it a try!
Byleth: Happiness for all.
Ignatz: Of course. Might be a little ambitious, but letâs give it a try!
Byleth: May you live your life honestly. 
Ignatz: Oh? Oh! I see! Yes, that's a wonderful vow.
Ignatz: Now, let us pray.
Ignatz: ...
Ignatz: Did you feel that?! I think the goddess is near!
Byleth: Still ridiculous.
Ignatz: Youâre right, of course.

Lysithea: Professor?
Byleth: Yes? 
Lysithea: I saw you wandering off to this tower. I thought you might be lost or something, so I followed you inside.
Byleth: Actually, I'm a ghost.
Lysithea: Don't toy with me like that, Professor! I know it's you. I figured you might be lost or something, so I followed you inside.
Lysithea: Everyone seems to be looking for you. You're surprisingly popular.
Byleth: That surprises you, does it? 
Lysithea: I do find it surprising, yes. Particularly your popularity with the ladies.
Byleth: Naturally.
Lysithea: Despite your confidence, I'm still surprised by your popularity with the ladies.
Lysithea: It isn't like you're very sociable, after all. Not to be rude, mind you.
Byleth: How do you fare in such matters?
Lysithea: Er, I wouldn't know, to be honest. I have no interest in such things. The academy is for honing one's skills. Not for frivolous romances, despite what the other students may think. I overheard them gossiping about a place where a man and a woman can make a vow, and it is certain it will come to pass. Seems to be some folktale they enjoy. I wonder where this place is...
Byleth: The Goddess Tower?
Lysithea: Oh, of course! I recall now. It'sâ Wait. That's... That's here, isn't it?! Uh, just to be clear, this is pure coincidence. I didn't follow you for...for that. But we are here alone, so people may wonder what our aim is. Let's get out of here before someone sees us and gets the wrong idea!
Byleth: There's no need for panic.
Lysithea: Are you saying you don't mind if someone sees us and thinks... Oh, I suppose you believe there's no danger of that, since it's just me. You're treating me like a child, aren't you? Well, I don't mind either, then. Obviously there's nothing going on here. If you're going stick to around until we collect dust, then so will I!
Lysithea: ...
Lysithea: Actually, I'm gonna go now. Don't you stay too long either! You'll catch your death of cold out here.

Marianne: Please be patient! I'll be done with my prayer in a moment... Dear Goddess, I beg thee... Oh! Professor?
Byleth: Is someone else here?
Marianne: No... I'm the only one here. Umm... Well, more accurately, I'm the only human present. My bird friend is here as well.
Byleth: You're talking to a bird?
Marianne: No! Well. It's more like the bird is...doing me a favor. They say if a man and a woman pray here, on this night, their wish will come true. At least, that's how the legend goes.
Byleth: And the bird?
Marianne: It's a pigeon. A...male pigeon. At least, I think so. I thought he might count as a man.
Marianne: ...
Byleth: ...
Marianne: Well, I'd better be leaving. It seems my pigeon friend got impatient and flew away.
Byleth: I'm sorry...
Marianne: No, it's fine. The goddess probably wouldn't accept a male pigeon anyway.
Byleth: I'll take his place.
Marianne: Oh? Um. Are you saying you'll pray with me, Professor?
Byleth: ...
Marianne: Thank you! If you have a wish for the future, let's pray for it, OK?
Byleth: What is your wish?
Marianne: Who, me? Oh, nothing in particular. Let's pray for your wish. There must be something you want. Well?
Byleth: Peace in FÃ³dlan.
Marianne: Very well. Let us pray.
Byleth: Only to see you smile.
Marianne: Hey, no need to tease me...
Marianne: Professor? I must be going now, but...I'm glad I ran into you.

Hilda: Professor! You're not waiting for anyone, right? Thought so! I bet you've never heard the legend about this tower then.
Byleth: I haven't...
Byleth: What legend?
Hilda: Something special happens here during the Ethereal Moon, on the night of the ball. First, an unmarried boy and girl need to meet at the Goddess Tower and make a vow. Then, the goddess will grant them divine protection, and ensure that their vow comes true. Or so they say! It's a well-known story among the students. A couple guys invited me up here, but...
Byleth: You turned them down?
Hilda: Yes, I did.
Byleth: They stood you up?
Hilda: No! How rude. I turned them down.
Hilda: If I accepted their invitations, then our vow would come true. It's just a legend, sure...but I prefer to be cautious about such things. One of the guys was pretty handsome, and he came from a good family... But that doesn't really tell you what a person's like on the inside. I want a life partner who's good-hearted and good-looking. Anyway, I went for a walk and happened upon you, and I thought... The professor's perfect. Why don't I just make a vow with him? Hah! I'm just kidding, Professor. To be honest, I wanted to spy on you. See if you had someone else up here. Although, if you did want to make a vow with me, I wouldn't object. Need some time to consider?
Byleth: Yes. Let's revisit this tomorrow morning.
Hilda: Hang on! It won't mean anything tomorrow! Oh, I get it! Everyone's looking for you down there, girls included. You don't want to keep them waiting. You're pretty smooth, you know that? Well, I'm off, then. I'll see you at the ball. Ah... Did the goddess hear that conversation?

Leonie: Hey, Professor. You all alone here? I mean, you're not waiting for anyone or anything, are you?
Byleth: Actually, I'm meeting the archbishop.
Leonie: Liar. I saw Lady Rhea just moments ago. She was in the reception hall.
Byleth: Manuela should be here any moment.
Leonie: Yeah, right! I just passed her flirting with some guy on my way up.
Leonie: Anyway, I saw you heading to the tower, so I thought I'd drop by. I figured you might be lonely.
Byleth: You figured that, did you?
Leonie: Hey, don't make it weird! By the way... Have you heard the legend about this place? They say if a guy and a girl make a promise here together, the goddess will make sure it's kept.
Byleth: I've heard.
Leonie: It's a pretty well-known legend.
Byleth: I had not heard that.
Leonie: Really? It's a pretty well-known legend.
Leonie: Thing is, the way the story goes, it doesn't work all the time. It has to be the night of the ball. Tonight. So, since it's just you and me here, what do you say we give it a go? I mean, I don't know if the goddess will really take the time for a pair like us, but it's worth a try.
Byleth: What are you suggesting?
Leonie: Wellâyou know! Let's make some kind of promise! We've got the chance, it'd be a shame to waste it. I mean, not something romantic or anything. That'd be weird. We could promise I'll become a top-tier mercenary! Though I guess that's more of a wish... Let's see... OK, I've got it. I solemnly swear to meet you once more, on this very ground, as a mercenary beyond compare! Oh, but that was all about me. No fair. You probably have something you want to promise too.
Byleth: No, I think that covers it.
Leonie: Hah. You really do take after Captain Jeraltâalways putting others first. All right, then, Goddess. You heard the promise. It's a done deal. Say, Professor...why did you come out here, anyway?
Byleth: I just wanted some time alone.
Leonie: Ah. Well, it is pretty crowded down there. I guess I shouldn't have interrupted. I'll leave you to it. But don't stay out here too long, all right? You'll catch a cold!

Flayn: Professor? Is that you over there? It seems both of us were curious about this place.
Byleth: What are you talking about?
Flayn: Oh, perhaps I was mistaken. I figured you had come to this tower after having heard the legend.
Byleth: What legend?
Flayn: You've not heard of it, then? I suppose I only recently learned of it myself, from a friend. Legend tells that on the night of a ball, when a man and woman pledge vows at this very tower... The goddess will bestow her blessing, ensuring those vows come to pass. Of course, such things do not really come to pass. But there are many who place stock in this legend. I wondered what sort of vows youths tend to pledge... So here I am, hoping to gain deeper understanding. Only to bump into you! Are you meeting someone here, perchance?
Byleth: No, I'm not.
Flayn: That's unfortunate. I wonder if anyone else will be coming... Professor? If the legend were true, what type of vow might you pledge?
Byleth: It's hard to say...
Flayn: No ideas? Perhaps your imagination is lacking due to the lack of a partner. What say you to being my partner? How about sharing a vow with me? I'll give you until the count of three to come up with something heartfelt and honorable. One...two...three! Go ahead!
Byleth: May we always be together.
Byleth: May we both find joy.
Flayn: Oh! You made my heart flutter! I see. This is the type of vow one would make to another. You've taught me well, as a professor should. I'm most certainly wiser and more mature than I was, even just moments ago. Oh dear. What if the goddess really did hear your vow? Although...I suppose I would not mind if that turned out to be the case. I bid you good evening.

@Dialogue 
Sothis: Running away? I understand. You hardly had the time to breathe in there. It must be hard to be the favourite teacher at the ball! Poor, poor Professor!
Byleth: I am not everyone's favorite...
Sothis: Was that a joke? I find it hard to tell with you. Just think of all the students begging you to dance!
Byleth: It is difficult. 
Sothis: So you do think you're the favorite! I might have known.

Dimitri: Professor? What are you doing here?
Byleth: Aren't you going to dance with Edelgard?
Dimitri: No, I should think not.
Byleth: Aren't you going to dance with Claude?
Dimitri: Haha, good one, Professor. I could see saving a dance for Edelgard, but Claude is another story. In any case, I have no intention of dancing with anyone.
Dimitri: As a child, Edelgard taught me how to dance. It was...a bit awkward, honestly.
Byleth: Edelgard?
Byleth: As a child?
Dimitri: I've told you before we're siblings by marriage, haven't I? Her birth mother was my stepmother, although I didn't know that at the time. My stepmother treated me with such kindness...just as though I were her own flesh and blood. And yet she never so much as hinted that she had her own child...Edelgard. We were born and raised in different territories, without ever knowing the other even existed. Yet, against all odds, for just over a year, we became childhood friends.
Byleth: Friends?
Byleth: Not siblings?
Dimitri: Indeed. Unaware of each other's stations or backgrounds, we met and became incredibly close. This was when she and Lord Arundel were living in the Kingdom.
Byleth: Why were they in the Kingdom?
Dimitri: They were in exile... This was a time of great turmoil within the Empire. I ran into her when visiting Lord Arundel's residence with my father. She seemed...quite bored. With everything. At first I found her to be difficult and stubborn, but that facade quickly fell away, revealing her true self beneath... That's around the time when she taught me how to dance. Her instruction was... Oh, let's call it strict. To put it nicely.

@Flashback
Edelgard: Wrong foot, Dimitri! You're supposed to lead with your right!
Dimitri: El, the sun's going down! I really oughta be heading home...

@Dialogue
Dimitri: That one year before she had to return to the Empire was...so much fun. The time of my life, in many ways.
Dimitri: It's kind of pathetic to think about it all these years later, but can you guess what I gave her as a parting gift?
Byleth: Flowers?
Byleth: A book?
Dimitri: No, that makes too much sense. Actually, I gave her a dagger! You should have seen the look on her face!
Byleth: A dagger? 
Dimitri: Huh. Good guess, Professor. But I swear, it came from the heart.
Dimitri: In Faerghus, we've long considered blades as tools of destiny. As a way to cut a path to a better future. She was being dragged all over, unable to live the life she wanted. I thought the dagger could help her cut out a path to the future she dreamed of. However...that was many years ago. I'm sure she's forgotten all about the boy I was back then.
Dimitri: I'm afraid it's far too late for that. Things are different now. She's different. I'm different.  Anyway... I'm feeling a bit out of place here. Festivities like this don't suit me.
Dimitri: Professor... Will you join me for a bit? You must be getting a bit tired of the ball by now.

Sothis: But where is there to run? This place is filled with joyful students looking for a dance.

@Dialogue 
Sothis: It seems that everyone is having a delightful time. Will you not dance some more?
Byleth: I'm tired.
Byleth: I'd rather not.
Sothis: How dull of you! Had I a body of my own... Oh, I would sing and dance until I fell upon the ground! But you... Hmph. Do as you will.
Sothis: Ah, you're not the only one who feels that way. Look over there.
Rhea: ...
Sothis: Hmph. I'm bored beyond compare. Will you not follow her?
Byleth: Why would I?
Byleth: I have no reason to. 
Sothis: Oh, come on! Hurry up! I know that you are curious to see what she is up to... I hear...someone singing. From other there...

Rhea:  âª In time's flow...see the glow of flames ever burning bright... On the swift river's drift, broken memories alight... âª

Sothis: That song... I feel I have heard it in the past... Actually... It is not that I have heard it. I... Did I once sing that song to someone? No. There's more. I wrote this song... Oh, but how could that be so? If that were true, then how could she be singing it? Unless... No, no. I am suddenly so exhausted... As are you, no doubt? Quickly then. To bed with you.

@Intro
Alois: Captain? Captain! Where are you? Hey, Professor. Have you seen your old man?
Alois: Too bad. I guess it will have to be you, then...
Jeralt: I'm back. Sorry for the delay, my last mission took longer than expected.
Alois: Captain! Thank goodness you're here. There are reports of Demonic Beasts near the chapel!
Jeralt: Nonsense. I haven't heard anything about the monastery's walls being breached.
Alois: That's why I'm heading there now, to see what's really going on. You'll join as well, won't you?
Jeralt: Of course. We're both sworn to protect this place.
Byleth: Where did they come from?
Byleth: Demonic Beasts?
Alois: It's odd. Just before they appeared, someone saw a number of students heading toward the chapel. They were apparently acting strange, as though they weren't in their right minds. Shortly after, Demonic Beasts started to appear, one after the other.
Byleth: Are the students safe?
Byleth: Were the students killed?
Jeralt: Hm... The students... There's no way those Demonic Beasts got in from the outside... But none of that matters right now. We need to act. Go summon your students.
Jeralt: Damn it... I wanted to talk to you about something important, but there's no time. There's never any damn time. But this is much more urgent, so it can hold for now. I'll meet you there.

@Opening 
Things take a turn for the worse as you and Jeralt investigate an abandoned chapel in Garreg Mach.

@Battle 
Jeralt: There really are Demonic Beasts here... They're emerging from the chapel! I'll head that way. The rest of you, protect the students who weren't able to get away.
Student: Help me! These beasts... They're...
Student: Argh! Somebody help me!

Jeralt: That beast... There's a stone or something on its forehead...
Monica: ...

@Battle-Talk
%Byleth,Jeralt
Jeralt: Do you really think you can keep going? Don't push yourself too hard. Thinking about what happened in Remire village, it's clear you've gotten the hang of being a leader. Maybe you should have taken command of me too!

@Battle
Student: ...

Jeralt: The Demonic Beasts were actually students? How can this be...

Student: Thank you! But my friends who couldn't get away... Are they OK?

Student: I was so scared... I'll find a way to repay you, I promise!

Student: Sorry. That was a close one...
Student: Phew... You saved me. Thank you!

@End 
Jeralt: There isn't a trace of evidence to be found in the chapel. This must have been something to do with Remire. Perhaps...
Monica: Wait!
Jeralt: Huh? Another student?

@Cutscene
Jeralt: Run along now.
Monica: Thanks for all your help, sir.
Monica: You're just a pathetic old man. How dare you get in the way of my brilliant plan...you dog.
Jeralt: Run along now.
Monica: Thanks for all your help, sir.
Monica: Huh? What are you doing here?
Thales: You must survive. Merely because there is a role that I require you to fulfill.

Jeralt: Sorry. It looks like...I'm going to have to leave you now.

Jeralt: To think that the first time I saw you cry...your tears would be for me. It's sad, and yet...I'm happy for it. Thank you...kid.

@End 
Sothis: So this is where your father lived... Hm? Are you still crying? If turning back the hands of time was not enough to save his life, you must accept what came to pass was fate.
Byleth: It wasn't fate.
Sothis: Control yourself. Though Jeralt's death was at the hands of wicked ones, a fate is still a fate.
Byleth: Our enemies will pay.
Sothis: Agreed. We cannot let the wicked ones run free. 
Sothis: Oh! Your father said to look for something here. He must be referring to whatever is behind that bookcase there...
Sothis: Your father's diary... Huh, his handwriting is prettier than his face would suggest. Well, well! These entries here are from before your birth. He seems to have been writing this for quite some time. Hm? Ah... Read that part there. Horsebow Moon, Year 1159...

Jeralt: Day 20 of the Horsebow Moon. All is cloudy. I can't believe she's dead. Lady Rhea said she died during childbirth. But is that the truth? And still, the child she traded her life for doesn't make a sound. Didn't even cry at birth.

Sothis: Well now! That baby must be you! That means... Hm? Someone is approaching us.

@End 
^start 
Dimitri: There you are. Lady Rhea is looking for you, Professor. And after your audience, why don't you join me at the dining hall? You haven't eaten since...since it happened. Have you?
Byleth: ...
Dimitri: Forgive me... I suppose it's too soon to try and coax you back into the normal swing of things. As for what happened to Jeralt... I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't do anything to stop it. Stay here until you've found some peace. I'll cover for you with Lady Rhea and everyone else.
Byleth: Thank you.
Dimitri: We'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready to return to us.
Byleth: If only.
Dimitri: No need to put on a brave face. No one would blame you for taking time for yourself.
Dimitri: I don't believe it's a sign of strength to just keep going forward no matter what. Taking the time to grieve for those we've lost...there's strength in that too. That's what I think, anyway. That said... It's also important to remember that no matter how sad you are, eventually your tears will dry up. That's when you have to figure out what it is you're living for. Then you can cling to that, with all your might, and start moving forward again.
Byleth: What I'm living for?
Dimitri: Four years ago, in Duscur, I experienced the same pain you're feeling now. My father...was the strongest man I knew. Someone I loved and admired deeply. That day, he was killed before my eyes. His head severed clean off. My stepmother, the kindest person I had ever known, left me behind and disappeared into the infernal flames. 
Dimitri: Everyone who I considered precious...my family and my closest friends...I couldn't save any of them. Not a single one. Now, the burden of the work they left behind falls on me. I must ensure they have no regrets. That's my duty, as the sole survivor of the tragedy. It's a heavy burden, but accepting it gave me the strength to pick myself up off the ground and start moving again. Start living again. 
Dimitri: Jeralt is gone... So, what will you do now, Professor? What must you do? Look deep in your heart and I'm certain you'll find the answer there...indelible and inescapable. 
Dimitri: I've probably bothered you enough for today, but I have just one more thought to leave you with. Even now, Seteth is gathering the knights to begin a full scale search for the enemy. It may not be right away, but before long they will find their trail. 
Dimitri: No matter what happens or what anyone may say, know that I plan to stand by you, Professor. Through anything. Until the bitter end.
Sothis: Well? Did you search deep within yourself as he suggested? And did you find yourself some answers? This book is filled with secrets yet unknown. We must return another time to read the rest. Oh, but I have at least figured one thing out. I know now why our fates are intertwined...

Alois: Ah... Here you are. To think that Captain... that Jeralt would meet his end like that. I hope you know that you were the most important thing in the world to him.
Byleth: I was? 
Byleth: What do you want?
Alois: He wasn't the most emotional guy. I'm sure expressing his affection wouldn't have come naturally to him. After what's happened, it's up to me now. I, Alois, swear to protect you in the captain's stead.  Sorry. This isn't the time for my blathering. Lady Rhea is looking for you. I came to tell you that. I'll take my leave now.
Sothis: This book is filled with secrets yet unknown. We must return another time to read the rest. Oh, but I have at least figured one thing out. I know now why our fates are intertwined...

@Dialogue 
Rhea: Professor. I have been waiting for you. I am filled with grief at the loss of our most celebrated knight. Jeralt was an ally of many years...and also a dear friend.
Byleth: Many years?
Byleth: When did you meet?
Rhea: It was a long while back. At the time, Jeralt was a soldier of the Kingdom. He was injured in battle, and I saved him just as he was about to perish. That was our first meeting. After that, he became a Knight of Seiros. He gave his all to the service of the church.
Byleth: Why did he leave the knights?
Byleth: But it had been so long since you last saw him...
Rhea: He...fell in love with one of the nuns here at Garreg Mach. Their love produced a child...whom she died giving birth to. It was her decision. She weighed her own life against that of her child's and, in the end, implored me to save the child. Your father...never truly accepted that decision. He took the childâtook youâand disappeared without warning.
Byleth: Who was my mother?
Byleth: Did I inherit my Crest from my mother?
Rhea: Your mother...she was my...
Alois: Sorry for the interruption, Lady Rhea. There's something you must hear immediately. A report from the knights patrolling the area...
Rhea: Very well. Professor, you are dismissed for the day. Please rest and focus only on mending your heart. Understood?
/***EOF***/
@Cutscene 
Mounted Knight: Huh?

Soldier: Lady Seiros!

Seiros: Tell me, Nemesis, do you recall the Red Canyon?

Seiros: You'll die for that! Die, die! You took...everything... that I loved!

Seiros: He's gone now, Mother...

Sothis: Oh my. What could have brought you here?

@Dialogue 
Sothis: I wonder how you got in here... It is most rude to interrupt a moment of repose. Very rude indeed. Now come to me. I wish to have a look at you.

Sothis: Hmm... I have not seen the likes of you before. Who are you, anyway?
Byleth: I'm a ghost.
Sothis: Do not deceive. You would do well to keep your wit in line. 

Byleth: I'm a demon.
Sothis: Do not deceive. You would do well to keep your wit in line. 

Byleth: I'm a mortal.
Sothis: I see. Then you must have a name of sorts. Go on.

Sothis: Huh. I shall not ever grow accustomed to the sound of human names. You must possess a day of birth as well. Beneath which moon and on what day were you born to this world?

Sothis: Well, wonders never cease! It seems we share our day of birth. How strange! Hmm. It all feels so...familiar. I think it may be time for yet another nap... It is almost...time to...begin...

@Intro 
Jeralt: Hey. Time to wake up.

Jeralt: Were you having that dream again?
Byleth: I was dreaming about a war...
Jeralt: Massive armies clashing on a vast field, right? There hasnât been a battle like that in over three centuries...

Byleth: I was dreaming about a young girl...
Jeralt: Youâve described her to me before. I donât think Iâve ever met anyone like that.

Jeralt: In any case, just put that out of your mind for now. The battlefield is no place for idle thoughts. Risking your life is part of the job for mercenaries like us. Letting your mind wander is a sure way to get yourself killed.

Jeralt: OK, time to get moving. Our next job is in the Kingdom. I told you before. Itâs far from here, so weâll need to leave at dawn.
Byleth: Oh, right... 

Byleth: Of course. 
Jeralt: Hm? Good grief. Everyone is already waiting for us outside.

Mercenary: Jeralt! Sir! Sorry to barge in, but your presence is needed.
Jeralt: What's happened?

Dimitri: Please forgive our intrusion. We wouldnât bother you were the situation not dire.
Jeralt: What do a bunch of kids like you want at this hour?
Dimitri: Weâre being pursued by a group of bandits. I can only hope that you will be so kind as to lend your support.
Jeralt: Bandits? Here?
Edelgard: It's true. They attacked us while we were at rest in our camp.
Claude: Weâve been separated from our companions and weâre outnumbered. Theyâre after our lives...not to mention our gold.
Jeralt: Iâm impressed youâre staying so calm considering the situation. I... Wait. That uniform...
Mercenary: Bandits spotted just outside the village! Damn... There are a lot of them.
Jeralt: I guess they followed you all the way here. We canât abandon this village now. Come on, letâs move. Hope youâre ready.

@Battle 

Jeralt: Letâs take care of those thieves before they overrun the village. Take down the enemies in front first. That should take the wind out of their sails.

Edelgard: You have a strange aura about you... You say youâre a mercenary, so show me what you can do.

Dimitri: Thank you. We are in your debt. It wouldnât do for us to fall in a place like this. Please, lend us your strength. Letâs work together to drive out these thieves!

Claude: Itâs because of you guys that Iâm not dead right now. Thanks for that! I didnât expect to run into mercenaries like you in some remote village. The gods of fortune must be smiling on me!

Jeralt: Weâll advance while protecting ourselves from the enemy. Take up position inside the forest.

Jeralt: Yes, good. If weâre in the forest, we can sustain their attacks without losing the advantage.

Jeralt: This is a fine opportunity. Use the combat arts I taught you!

Jeralt: Attack when an ally is nearby, and the enemy will be intimidated, making them easier to hit.

@Battle
Kostas: Damn. Why are there mercenaries in the village? Guess we'll have to deal with them too.

@Boss
Kostas: I'm gonna kill you where you stand...

%Jeralt,Kostas
Kostas: What the?! Aren't you Jeralt the Blade Breaker? What's a renowned mercenary like you doing here?
Jeralt: I'm the one who should be complaining. I'm caught up in the mess you started!

%Byleth,Kostas
Kostas: Hey, you with the blank stare! Outta my way!

@Cutscene 
Kostas: You'll die!

Sothis: Honestly! What are you accomplishing with that little stunt?! Itâs like youâre trying to get me killed, you fool!

Sothis: Well, itâs fine. After all, if you donât know the value of your own life, youâre not going to protect it very well, are you? Course not.  Well then, I guess itâs up to me to guide you from now on, right? You can call me Sothis...but Iâm also known as âThe Beginningâ.

@Dialogue 
Sothis: Hmm... Sothis... Yes, that is it. My name is Sothis. And I am also called...The Beginning. But who once called me that?

Byleth: What are you talking about?
Byleth: Sothis?
Sothis: I was not able to recall my name...until just now. And just like that, it came to me. How odd. That look upon your face... Did you think me a child? A mere child who forgot her own name?! Phooey! That âchildâ just saved your life! And what does that make you?

Byleth: I am no child.
Sothis: Ha! Such arrogance. You look the part but are you truly an adult?
Byleth: I'm less than a child? 
Sothis: Correct! You understand.
Sothis: You threw yourself before an axe to save just one young girl. Yet all is well, as I have stalled the flow of time for now. You would have died had I not intervened.

Byleth: Thank you.
Sothis: There now. Is gratitude so much to ask? I did deem you worth saving, after all.
Byleth: You stopped time?
Sothis: Hm. I do not hear your gratitude. Perhaps I should force you to leave?  There now. Is gratitude so much to ask? I did deem you worth saving, after all.
Sothis: Though it is only momentary, time has stopped. However did I manage that...

Byleth: What will happen when time resumes?
Byleth: What now?
Sothis: When time begins again, the axe will tear into your flesh, and you will surely meet your end. How rude of you to drag me into this! Now what to do...

Byleth: Turn back the hands of time. 
Sothis: Of course! I must turn back the hands of time!
Byleth: Keep time frozen until I'm safe.
Sothis: That is ridiculous! Oh, but perhaps... Of course! I must turn back the hands of time!
Byleth: I'll just stay here and wait to die. 
Sothis: As though I could stand idly by and watch that come to pass! Oh, but perhaps... Of course! I must turn back the hands of time!
Sothis: Yes... I do believe it can be done. You really are quite troublesome. I cannot wind back time too far, but all is well. You are aware of whatâs to come, which means you can protect yourself this time. Now, go... Yes, you who bears the flames within. Drift through the flow of time to find the answers that you seek...

@Cutscene 
Edelgard: Huh?
Kostas: You'll die!

Claude: Heyâover here!

@End 
Jeralt: Hey... Did you just...

Alois: The Knights of Seiros are here! We'll cut you down for terrorizing our students. Hey, the thieves are running away! Go after them! The students seem to be unharmed. And...who's this?
Jeralt: Ugh... Why him?
Event: An Unexpected Reunion
Alois: Captain Jeralt?! It is you! Goodness, itâs been ages. Donât you recognize me? Itâs Alois! Your old right-hand man! Well, thatâs how I always thought of myself anyway. It must have been 20 years ago that you went missing without a trace. I always knew you were still alive!
Jeralt: You havenât changed a bit, Alois. Just as loud as ever. And drop that âcaptainâ nonsense. Iâm not your captain anymore. These days Iâm just a wandering mercenary. One who has work to do. Good-bye, old friend.
Alois: Right... Good-bye, Captain. Wait! That isn't how this ends. I insist that you return to the monastery with me!
Jeralt: Garreg Mach Monastery... I suppose this was inevitable.
Alois: And how about you, kid? Are you the captain's child?
Byleth: He is a stranger to me. 
Alois: Great sense of humor, this one. Clearly cut from the same cloth as the captain.
Byleth: I'm a bandit. 
Alois: Great sense of humor, this one. Clearly cut from the same cloth as the captain.
Byleth: That is correct.
Alois: Is that so? Well, physical differences aside, your mannerisms do remind me of the captain.
Alois: I'd love for you to see the monastery too. You will join me, won't you?

Alois: What's troubling you, Captain? You aren't about to run off again, are you?
Jeralt: Even I wouldn't dare run from the Knights of Seiros.

Sothis: The Knights of Seiros... They do seem rather skilled.

Sothis: Ah. It seems your presence is required. Get going!

Edelgard: I appreciate your help back there. Your skill is beyond question. Youâre clearly an experienced mercenary. And your father...that would be Jeralt, the Blade Breaker? Former captain of the Knights of Seiros. Oft praised as the strongest knight to ever live. Have I missed anything?
Byleth: The Knights of Seiros?
Edelgard: You havenât heard of the Knights of Seiros? The most famous order of knights in all of FÃ³dlan?
Byleth: I didn't know he was a captain. 
Edelgard: How curious. Iâd wager the explanation for that is fascinating indeed.
Claude: Hey! You are coming with us to the monastery, right? Of course you are. Iâd love to bend your ear as we travel. Oh, I should mention that the three of us are students of the Officers Academy at Garreg Mach Monastery. We were doing some training exercises when those bandits attacked. I definitely got the worst of it.
Edelgard: That would be because you ran off.
Claude: Too true! I was the first to make a strategic retreat. Everything would have worked out if these two hadnât followed me and ruined everything. Because of them, every single one of those bandits chased after us. Utterly ridiculous.
Dimitri: Ah, so thatâs what you were thinking, Claude. And here I thought you were acting as a decoy for the sake of us all.
Edelgard: His intentions were as clear as day. You will prove a lacking ruler if you cannot see the truth behind a person's words.
Dimitri: Hm. You will prove a lacking ruler if you look for deceit behind every word and fail to trust those whom you rely on.
Claude: Oh, joy. A royal debate between Their Highnesses. I wonder how being completely predictable affects oneâs ability to wield power. Personally, as the embodiment of distrust, Iâd say your little exchange smacks of naivetÃ©.
Edelgard: Me? NaÃ¯ve? Tell me, are you actually incapable of keeping quiet, or is your lack of self-awareness a condition of some sort?
Dimitri: In any case, forgive our digression. I must speak with you, if you can spare a moment. The way you held your ground against the banditsâ leader was captivating! You never lost control of the situation. It showed me I still have much to learn.
Edelgard: Your skill is precisely why I must ask you to consider lending your services to the Empire. I might as well tell you now. I am no mere student. I am also the Adrestian Empireâsâ
Dimitri: Halt, Edelgard. Please allow me to finish my own proposition. The Holy Kingdom of Faerghus is in dire need of exceptional individuals such as yourself. Please, do consider returning to the Kingdom with me.
Claude: Whoa, there! You two sure are hasty. Trying to recruit someone you just met. Tactless, really. I was personally planning to develop a deep and lasting friendship on our journey back to the monastery before begging for favors. But it seems thereâs no time for niceties in this world. So, capable stranger, letâs get right to it. Where does your allegiance lie?
Sothis: Hmm. It seems one's place of birth is quite significant to them. Yet they are so impressed by you, that you may take your pick. Well?

Byleth: Adrestian Empire: Land of Ancient History 
Edelgard: A wise choice. Though the Empire has fallen from its former glory, the other regions are merely offshoots that pale in comparison.

Byleth: Holy Kingdom of Faerghus: Land of Noble Knights 
Dimitri: Understood. Faerghus is a noble and distinguished kingdom that has always valued chivalry.

Byleth: Leicester Alliance: Burgeoning League of Nobles 
Claude: Is that right? Well, thatâs a win for the Alliance, so I suppose Iâm obligated to be happy.

Alois: All right, that's enough with the small talk. It's time to head back to the monastery.
Claude: Looks like we'll have to pick this up another time.

Sothis: My, my. They are in such a hurry. You know... Each of the three is most unique.

Byleth: Edelgard... 
Byleth: Dimitri... 
Byleth: Claude... 
Sothis: Yes, I thought the same. I am so sleepy once again... I may be sleeping...but I...

@Opening 
As cold air begins to creep in from the north of Faerghus, FÃ³dlan welcomes the riches of fall. The women spend their days reaping the golden fields, gratefully embracing the bounty the goddess has once again provided. The men venture into the wild with horsebows and empty sacks ready to be filled with game.

@Dialogue 
Rhea: As I believe you are already aware, Seteth's younger sister, Flayn, has gone missing. At present, all we know for certain is that she has not left Garreg Mach.
Seteth: Flayn is not the type of person to just wander off on her own without telling me where she is going! We have searched the monastery thoroughly, but have found nothing. I am now mobilizing the knights to begin searching the town. Troubling rumors have been running rampant lately. I do not wish to consider the worst, but...
Byleth: Troubling rumors?
Byleth: What is it you're afraid of?
Rhea: There are rumors of someone prowling the streets and attacking innocents, night after night. The knights have investigated the matter. They have not discovered any remains, nor have they found any concrete evidence.
Seteth: The people are panicked! They all insist someone called the Death Knight is coming to claim their souls with his blade. There is no way she could have escaped unscathed if she were captured by such a fiend! Where is she?!
Rhea: Seteth, recall that impatience begets error. Please do your best to calm yourself. I think of your...sister as family as well. You know that. You have my support. We will devote ourselves fullyâmind, body, and soulâto recovering her.  Professor. Your mission for this month is to help find Flayn. The knights have the town covered, so I ask that you focus your efforts on searching the monastery again. We do not have time to waste. You have your orders.

^start 
Hubert: Flayn has gone missing? Most unsettling.
Edelgard: It doesn't seem likely that she's simply gotten lost. I'll help in any way that I can.
Ferdinand: So, our mission this month is to find her? Well then, let us hurry and locate her before anyone else!
Bernadetta: I hope Flayn is OK! What would happen if... Just what would we do if...
Dorothea: You can't think like that, Bern. Seteth would have a heart attack if he heard you.
Linhardt: I've heard that she has a Crest, but I suppose, for this moment, that is irrelevant.
Hubert: We'll start by gathering information. Someone must have seen Flayn recently.
Edelgard: Right. If we work together, I'm certain we'll find her.

Dimitri: Flayn has disappeared? Seteth must be beside himself.
Sylvain: So finding little Flayn is our mission for this moon? Leave it to me, Professor. Chasing after girls is my specialty.
Ingrid: Sylvain... Even you must agree that now isn't the time for jokes.
Annette: I hope Flayn is OK. I've heard rumors about some Death Knight running around town...
Felix: Sounds intriguing. I had been hoping to cross blades with him.
Ingrid: Felix! Please consider how Seteth must be feeling right now.
Dimitri: In any case, we must start our search at once. Every moment matters. On your order, Professor, let's try to collect as much information as we can.

Hilda: What? Flayn is missing?!
Claude: So, finding Flayn is our mission for the month, I take it?
Raphael: Wait. Who's Flayn?
Leonie: Seteth's little sister. Surely you've seen her flitting about the monastery.
Lysithea: She is the girl who looks about the same age as me, but seems well beyond her years.
Hilda: Seteth is much older than Flayn. He's always looking out for her. He must be worried sick. If I were to go missing, I can't imagine what that would do to my brother.
Claude: When searching for someone, it's best to start by gathering information. Hopefully someone has seen Flayn.

Dedue: I'm on the lookout for suspicious individuals. The only place I've yet to check is the library.
Byleth: We'll go together.
Dedue: As you wish.
Byleth: Get some rest. 
Dedue: As you wish. After I check the library.

Dedue: Candlelight... And who is that?
Byleth: Is it Flayn?
Byleth: Is it the Death Knight?
Dedue: No, it isn't. Impossible...
Dimitri: Professor. Dedue. What are you up to at this hour?
Dedue: Your Highness! My apologies.
Dimitri: Oh, none necessary. I'm sorry for startling you. I was just doing some research. But I'm just about finished. I didn't realize how late it had gotten. We'd better head back to our quarters, Dedue. Until tomorrow, Professor.

Sothis: A most unusual man! Whatever could he have been looking for so late at night? Hm? That book is quite askew... He must have rushed to put it back upon the shelf.
Byleth: ...
Sothis: It seems to be a record of donations from nobility. Arundel... That's not a name I know. But look at that! This Arundel gave quite a sum each year... That is, until the year 1174. He must have died or fallen to financial woe. Hmm... I can't imagine what this has to do with Flayn.
^end

@Conversation 
Sothis: Oh my... Just one small girl who's gone astray has caused all this. We cannot let this stand. You must do all you can to find out where's she's gone. Now ask around to see what information you can find. Come now! No time to waste!

Edelgard: We must begin our search for Flayn, Professor. If she ran off on her own free will, that's her business. But that may not be the case. For her sake, I suggest we assume that she was abducted and begin an investigation. Who benefits from kidnapping her? Let's gather all the information we can on anyone who's been acting strangely.



Edelgard: Manuela ran off with Jeritza's mask? Hmm... We'll have to speak with both of them. But where could Manuela be? Jertiza is likely at the training grounds or in his quarters on the eastern side of the knights' hall.



Edelgard: Flayn is missing... We should split up and search for her. There isn't a moment to waste. We must find her before it's too late.





Dimitri: When I consider how Seteth must be feeling, my heart breaks. We must find Flayn as soon as possible. There are no signs of her having left the monastery, but we cannot safely rule out any possibility just yet. I'm wasting precious time standing about trying to think of a solution. I'll survey the monastery and see what information I can gather. There must be someone who has a clue as to Flayn's whereabouts.



Dimitri: What? Professor Manuela ran off with Professor Jeritza's mask? I have a bad feeling about this... We must find them both at once! Professor Jeritza will be at the training grounds or his quarters. I believe the latter can be found on the eastern side of the knights' hall.



Dimitri: I have thoroughly surveyed the entire monastery, and yet I have not found a single trace of evidence that suggests Flayn was abducted. Perhaps we must seek out personal recounts rather than physical evidence... In any case, we must hurry before something terrible happens.





Claude: No sign of her leaving the monastery, eh? That is, assuming we can actually trust that information...
Hilda: Oh, but I'm sure this space has no shortage of secret passages and hiding spots!
Claude: True. For now, there's not much we can do aside from making a thorough search of the monastery.
Hilda: Let's ask around and see what we turn up. You never know who might have seen something.



Claude: Professor Manuela ran off with Professor Jeritza's mask? What could that possibly mean?
Hilda: Well, that's suspicious! Sounds like we should try talking to them.
Claude: Professor Jeritza is almost certainly in the training grounds or his quarters. Where was that again? Oh, over on the eastern side of the knights' hall.



Claude: Flayn's gone missing? Where could she be? If it were an ordinary kidnapping, you'd think there'd be a demand for ransom or something by now. I don't like the sound of this...



Hubert: If Flayn has been taken hostage, then we know she is alive. At least for now. There would be no point to abducting her if simple murder was the objective. That's only logical, Professor.



Ferdinand: A beautiful, delicate maiden vanishing into thin air... It is like something out of a book. If it were a book, we would have no need to worry! She would be rescued presently by a dashing nobleman. Do you have any idea as to where she might be? Where she might have wandered off to?
Byleth: Perhaps she went looking for treats? 
Ferdinand: That is what I thought! Why I am here, in fact. But she is nowhere to be seen.
Byleth: To the greenhouse, for some flowers?
Ferdinand: Hmm, the greenhouse. I did not think of that. I will take a look around there later.



Linhardt: Flayn? No, I haven't seen her. She's been abducted. Oh, you're looking for her. Sorry, my mind was somewhere else. I just recently learned she has a Crest. Did you know that, Professor? If it was a particularly rare Crest, I could imagine Professor Hanneman would have quite an intense interest in her. Oh, no, I'm not accusing Professor Hanneman of abducting Flayn.



Caspar: I don't know if she ran off or got kidnapped or what! I just know that Flayn's in trouble. That's it! I can't keep sitting around. I gotta go find her! Now where do I start?

Bernadetta: Uh, Flayn's not in here! Ugh, I guess I have to let you in to prove it, don't I?

Bernadetta: There. See? No one's in Bernie's room but Bernie. Maybe Flayn just wanted to be alone for a while. Have you considered that? Come to think of it, where is her room, anyway?



Dorothea: Hey, Professor, have you seen Manuela? I saw her running off somewhere in a terrible hurry. I wonder if it has anything to do with Flayn's disappearance. Do you know, Professor?
Byleth: You're on first-name terms with Professor Manuela?
Dorothea: Oh, yes. Didn't you know? She was the senior diva in our Opera Company.



Petra: Flayn was childnapped. That is what you are thinking? And the villain is inside our monastery? Hmm. I must have admittance. One person...has been catching my eye. Shamir is a knight not like other knights. Her movements are being reminders of...no, they remind me of warriors of Brigid. Before she was here, what was she getting up to...



Dedue: I've heard the monastery is full of secret passages. If there is no sign of Flayn's departure, it's possible that she used one of those. Whatever has happened, I hope she is all right.



Felix: Ah, you're looking for Flayn's kidnapper. I can't say anything for sure, but I do have suspicions about Jeritza. There's something about how he's handling his blade lately. It seems more...impulsive than usual. It couldn't hurt to try speaking with him, at least. At this hour, I think you'll find him sparring with Catherine at the training grounds.



Ashe: I heard something like this happened last year too. Neither the culprit nor the missing student were ever found last time. Some people say it was the work of evil spirits.
Byleth: Maybe it was.
Ashe: D-don't say things like that, Professor! I'm sure the culprit is, you know, corporeal. We'll catch whoever it is!
Byleth: Then it could be the same culprit. 
Ashe: I thought the same. Could there be a connection?



Sylvain: Ow! Ingrid just about slapped the teeth out of my head. All I did was suggest that Flayn had eloped...
Byleth: Quite an insensitive joke.
Sylvain: Insensitive? I was just exploring possibilities!
Byleth: Is that a possibility? 
Sylvain: I don't know. I was just suggesting things, then suddenly I was seeing stars and Ingrid was yelling at me.



Mercedes: Do you really think Flayn was kidnapped?
Byleth: She must have been. 
Mercedes: I have a feeling you're right. We really need to find her, and quickly!
Byleth: There must be another explanation.
Mercedes: Do you think she ran off on her own? That doesn't put me any more at ease.



Annette: There have been a lot of rumors swirling around lately about a Death Knight who kidnaps people from the nearby town... You don't think Flayn was...you know. Do you?
Byleth: We can't rule it out. 
Byleth: I don't believe so.
Annette: Whether the rumors are true or not, I just hope our Flayn is safe...



Ingrid: To think that Flayn would disappear like this... Seteth must be worried sick. I haven't got much to go off of, and perhaps it's out of line for me to feel so uncomfortable... But something has been bothering me for a while about Gilbert. I feel as though I've met him somewhere before... I also noticed him staring intently at Annette once. Hmm...



Lorenz: If Flayn were taken hostage, I expect we would have received demands from the culprit by now. Perhaps this is not a kidnapping at all. Do you suppose she could have simply run away?
Byleth: That's possible. 
Lorenz: If that is the case, it is unlikely that we will find her anywhere in the monastery.
Byleth: I don't think so.
Lorenz: What could it be, then? What possible motive could there be to abduct her?



Raphael: I hope Flayn isn't going hungry. If someone really kidnapped her, I'll never forgive them! Now that I think about it, I saw Alois hanging out by the pond not too long ago. He was always getting into trouble for trying to talk to Flayn, you know. It's probably a crazy thought, but I'm starting to worry.



Ignatz: I've only ever spoken to Flayn a handful of times. She always seemed so naive about the ways of the world. I'm worried about her.
Byleth: You think she'd be easily deceived? 
Ignatz: Yes, I'm afraid so. I just hope she comes home safe.
Byleth: Do you have feelings for Flayn?
Ignatz: Wh-what makes you say that?! This is hardly the time for teasing, you know!



Lysithea: Reflecting on it now, Flayn has always seemed a rather odd person. She appears young, yet there's something about her that seems much older than her years suggest. And she's quite wise, but also surprisingly naive...
Byleth: Maybe she's lived a very sheltered life. 
Lysithea: Hmm, you might be right. Whatever the case, Seteth seems to care for her more than anything.
Byleth: Maybe she's actually a ghost.
Lysithea: A ghost?! Don't be absurd!



Marianne: Dear Goddess, hear my prayer... Please watch over Flayn... Please protect her...

Hilda: I bet Flayn ran away. She couldn't stand being held back by Seteth any longer. I can emphasize. I know what it's like to have an overbearing big brother.

Leonie: Where could Flayn have gone? Do you think she's really been kidnapped? I hear Tomas has been going around asking about her... But he's probably just worried like the rest of us. Though it wasn't just Flayn. He was asking about you and Captain Jeralt too.



Rhea: Professor, have you still not found any leads regarding Flayn's whereabouts? I have looked everywhere. Not even the knights on guard have seen anything of note.
Byleth: You're searching too?
Rhea: I, too, care for Flayn. She is like family to me.
Byleth: We will find her, together. 
Rhea: Yes, let us work together. It reassures me to have you by my side.
Rhea: May the goddess protect dear Flayn until she returns to us...



Seteth: ...
Byleth: I will find her. I swear it. 
Seteth: That is all I ask. Please, lend me your aid!
Byleth: Try not to worry.
Seteth: You ask the impossible. Oh, Flayn...
Seteth: She would have never left the monastery of her own volition. Why is there not a trace of her to be found?!



Alois: Hey there, Professor. Did you want to talk?  What?! Me, abduct Flayn?! You can't really believe I did that!
Byleth: Did you find anything in the pond?
Alois: Well, this may sound silly, but... I was too scared to even look. I couldn't bear the thought of finding her in its depths.
Byleth: I hear she was always yelling at you...
Alois: Oh, that's just because of my dumb jokes. She says that they're not very good. But if I went around kidnapping everyone who said that, the whole monastery would be empty!



Catherine: Did you hear about Flayn? It's just one thing after another this year, I swear. Some of the lower-ranked knights are searching for her in the town. If they find anything, I'll know.  What? Jeritza? Hm, come to think of it, I haven't seen him today. What would make you suspect him?
Byleth: That mask he wears is suspicious.
Byleth: I heard that he goes out every night. 
Catherine: I see. Well, I'll let the knights know.



Shamir: What brings you here? I'm taking a break.  Is this about Flayn? You find me suspicious? Hah.
Byleth: You're not from FÃ³dlan.
Shamir: True. Your point being?
Byleth: What did you do before coming to the monastery?
Shamir: I was somewhere else. Fighting. Is that a problem?
Shamir: I understand that I don't fit in among the Knights of Seiros... But that hardly links me to Flayn's disappearance.

Shamir: Working hard, aren't you? I'll admit, I'm impressed. I can assist with any tasks, or help with your students

Shamir: On it. I'm available anytime I'm not on a mission with the knights.





Gilbert: Miss Flayn's whereabouts are unknown? I pray she is safe... We do not seem to have any leads at present.  I am one of the suspects, am I? Well, hopefully I can lay your suspicions to rest. Do you know of my, let's call it...unique situation?
Byleth: Your true identity?
Byleth: Do you mean Annette?
Gilbert: I was once a knight in service to the Faerghus royal family. If Ingrid believes she saw me before, it was likely in Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital. Annette is... She is my... But no, I would appreciate it, Professor, if you would ask no more.



Jeralt: Because of Flayn's disappearance, all of the knights are searching nonstop. But we haven't found a single lead. Seteth's face is getting paler by the minute. It's hard to watch.  What's that? You're looking for Manuela? Well, I did pass by her earlier. She was carrying something. A mask of some sort...
Byleth: Jeritza's mask?
Jeralt: I'm not close to the guy, so I can't say for sure. But come to think of it, you could be right.
Byleth: Flayn's mask?
Jeralt: Are you feeling all right? When have you ever seen Flayn wearing a mask?



Hanneman: Young Flayn's disappearance is most troubling.  What? Who would suspect me? You know what? I'll tell you who. A fool. That's who.
Byleth: Is her Crest rare enough to justify kidnapping her? 
Hanneman: Flayn's Crest, the Major Crest of Cethleann, is rare, but there are others who possess it.
Byleth: You have already investigated her thoroughly?
Hanneman: Alas, Seteth would never allow that. However, while Flayn's Major Crest of Cethleann is rare, there are other who possess it.



Tomas: Is something the matter? I see. So, Flayn has gone missing. I will do what I can to support the search.  Hm? It seems that you are a bit suspicious of me. Might I ask your reasons?
Byleth: Why were you asking about Flayn?
Tomas: I was away from the monastery for a few years, but do not forget... I have spent more than four decades in total working here at Garreg Mach Monastery. Yet it was not until recently that I learned that Seteth has a sister.
Byleth: Why were you asking about my father?
Tomas: It has been two decades since I last knew Jeralt, yet he looks nearly identical to my memory of him.
Tomas: It is only natural to be curious, don't you think? I assure you, there is nothing more to it than that.



Cyril: I can't believe Flayn just disappeared. I don't like it one little bit. Oh, are you here to see someone? Alois and Shamir and all the knights are gonna head into town soon.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Today...there is quite a bit to report! There is a masked individual who has been going into town every evening and not returning until the following morning. You see? Nothing gets past this guard! I doubt it has anything to do with Flayn's disappearance, but... Well, better safe than sorry, I always say.



Student: Professor! I saw him! A knight wielding a gigantic scythe! He was just like the rumors say! All covered in jet-black armor! It was the Death Knight, I just know it! You don't think he has something to do with Flayn's disappearance...do you?



Knight of Seiros: I can only imagine how worried Seteth must be, but isn't mobilizing the entire order of knights a bit...excessive? I was originally assigned to investigate those reports of the Death Knight in the town near Garreg Mach. When I think how many more victims that dastard might claim while we're all busy searching for Flayn... I'm sorry... That was insensitive. We're all under a lot of stress right now. It's important that we find her quickly.



Monk: I've served here at Garreg Mach in some capacity or another for several decades now. But after all that time, even I can't claim to know everything about the layout. Searching the entire interior of the monastery is a more difficult task than you may think. It makes you wonder who designed such a titanic compound. There are fragments of records remaining from its original construction, but none of them name an actual architect...



Monk: This might be the first time I've ever seen Seteth look so worn down. If poor Flayn was lured away by anyone... I personally think the clear suspect is that miscreant from Duscur. Those people are deceptive by nature...



Student: The whole monastery has been turned upside down! I wonder if we're still going to have the Battle of the Eagle and Lion next month. It's a yearly tradition, but with things the way they are right now...it's hard to imagine. At any rate, I hope they find Flayn soon.

@Intro
^start 
Edelgard: It seems Flayn is still missing. What could have happened to her?
Caspar: Everyone, hurry! I heard a scream from Professor Jeritza's room!
Sothis: Jeritza... Ah! The combat professor with the mask. He has always been rather suspicious. We must hurry!
Edelgard: Professor Jeritza? Are you there?
Hubert: He does not seem to be here... Hm? On the ground! Professor Manuela!
Byleth: Is she injured?
Byleth: Is she...dead?
Edelgard: No, She's unconscious. Someone clearly attacked her.
Hubert: Look at her hand. It looks as though she is pointing at something... There.
Edelgard: There's an opening behind that shelf. Perhaps a secret passageway...
Hanneman: What is the meaning of... Wait, is that Manuela? What happened here?
Edelgard: We know as much as you do. She needs to be taken to the infirmary.
Hanneman: Yes, of courseâand quickly. Give me a hand, child.
Edelgard: Understood. I'll support her head. Professor, I'll be back shortly. Please be careful.
Caspar: Does this mean Professor Jeritza did it? Could he also have kidnapped Flayn?!
Hubert: We should start by investigating this passageway. Do you agree, Professor?
Byleth: Let's investigate.
Hubert: Agreed. The culprit could be hiding inside.
Byleth: We should call for the knights.
Hubert: We don't have time for that. It would be on us if the culprit escaped.
Caspar: That settles it! We'll take the offensive. Here we come, you monsters!
Hubert: Shall we, Professor?

Dimitri: We still don't know where Flayn is... But we can't give up. Not until she's found.
Ingrid: Professor! Your Highness! I just heard a scream! In Professor Jeritza's quarters!
Sothis: Jeritza... Ah! The combat professor with the mask. He has always been rather suspicious. We must hurry!
Dimitri: Isn't that... Professor Manuela!
Annette: Professor Manuela! Please wake up! Professor Manuela!
Byleth: Is she injured?
Dimitri: She's still breathing...but she needs medical attention immediately!
Byleth: Is she...dead?
Dimitri: No, I believe she's just unconscious. But this wound requires immediate attention!
Annette: Look! Do you see Professor Manuela's hand? It's like she's pointing at something...
Dimitri: I see it! Behind that shelf! Could it be a secret passage?
Hanneman: What is the meaning of... Wait, is that Manuela? What happened here? We must take her to the infirmary immediately. You! Don't just stand there! Help me carry her.
Dimitri: Of course. I'll return shortly, Professor.
Annette: Do you think this is related to Flayn's disappearance?
Dedue: What should we do, Professor?
Byleth: Let's investigate.
Annette: It looks dark...uh...dark in there.
Mercedes: Aw, you've always been scared of dark places, haven't you, Annie? But don't worry! The professor and I will protect you.
Byleth: We should call for the knights.
Annette: You're right. We should call for help.
Ashe: But the culprit could flee while we wait! Sh-shouldn't we take a look?
Dedue: There are sounds coming from within. If we're going to investigate, now is the time.
Mercedes: We'll be OK, I'm sure of it. Are you ready, Professor?

Claude: There's still no sign of Flayn... What should we do, Teach? I'll admit, I'm out of schemes here.
Ignatz: Professor! Claude! Something's very wrong. Please hurry to Professor Jeritza's room!
Claude: Knock, knock. Is anybody...whoa! Professor Manuela!
Ignatz: I heard a scream coming from here just moments ago. It must have been Professor Manuela!
Byleth: Is she injured?
Claude: She's unconscious. She was clearly attacked by someone.
Byleth: Is she...dead?
Claude: No, I believe she's just unconscious. It looks like she was attacked by someone.
Hilda: Hey! It kind of looks like Professor Manuela is...pointing at something.
Claude: So we follow where she's pointing and... Oh? What do we have here? There's a rather suspicious hole behind that shelf.
Hanneman: What is the meaning of... Wait, is that Manuela? What happened here? We must take her to the infirmary immediately. You! Don't just stand there! Help me carry her.
Claude: Right, right. Hold down the fort for me, Teach. I'll be back once we get Professor Manuela taken care of.
Ignatz: What could have happened here? And where is Professor Jeritza?
Hilda: This must be related to that girl's disappearance. What if she's being held captive down there? No, no, that's crazy... Right?
Byleth: Let's investigate.
Ignatz: Right... It's scary, but... OK.
Hilda: Don't be a coward, Ignatz. We'll be fine as long as we stick close to the professor.
Byleth: We should call for the knights.
Ignatz: But...what if something bad happens while we're searching for the knights?
Hilda: You mean, like, a captured girl being strangled or something?
Ignatz: Ah...you're right. What should we do?
Hilda: We've got to investigate. Lead the way, Professor.
Ignatz: The culprit may be hiding inside, so let's be extra cautious!

@Intro 
^start 
Hubert: I never would have imagined... Hm? I see someone. They're unconscious.
Byleth: Is it Flayn?
Hubert: Yes, and there is someone else too. It appears to be another student.
Byleth: Is it Jeritza?
Hubert: No, Professor. It's two young girls.
Caspar: Someone's coming! I recognize that scythe and mask... It's that jerk we fought at the Holy Mausoleum!

Annette: What is this place? It's so...BAH! I see someone! I think...they're unconscious.
Byleth: Is it Flayn?
Ingrid: Yes, I see Flayn! But...who is this other person?
Byleth: Is it Jeritza?
Felix: Are you blind? They're obviously female. And there are two of them.
Annette: Professor! Someone's coming from farther in! That scythe... Is that the knight who attacked the Holy Mausoleum?

Hilda: It's way too creepy down here. And it smells funny. And...BAH! A person! They're...unconscious.
Byleth: Is it Flayn?
Hilda: Yes! It's Flayn! Oh, but there's someone else too...
Byleth: Is it Jeritza?
Hilda: Look closer, Professor. There are two girls.
Ignatz: Someone is coming! That scythe... Could it be the knight we fought at the Holy Mausoleum?
^end
Death Knight: That sword. You must be... One of us will die, the other will live. I will enjoy this dance of damnation.

@Opening 
The monastery is shocked to learn that Seteth's younger sister, Flayn, has gone missing. After an exhaustive search for clues, you finally come upon a lead...

@Battle 
Hubert: Our objective is to recover Flayn. Let us hope we are not too late.

Hubert: Hmm. Something odd about the floor over there. What will happen if we step on it?

Hubert: Contraptions in the floor. Stay alert.

Hubert: Interesting apparatus. I wonder if we can operate it.

Flame Emperor Soldier: So, you have come! I'll make sure you never leave!


Dedue: That knight looks like death itself. We must rescue Flayn immediately.

Dedue: There's something strange about the flooring at the end of the corridor. Something might happen if you step there.

Dedue: Some kind of contraption has been activated.

Dedue: What is this device? It appears operational.


Hilda: Professor, we need to defeat the Death Knight, and then rescue Flayn!

Hilda: Hm. Look at that strange tile over there. I bet something will happen if you step on it.

Hilda: Whoa. Look at those weird contraptions on the floor.

Hilda: I wonder what that is? Looks like you can use it, but who knows what'll happen.

@Boss 
Death Knight: I have no need of you...

%Byleth,Death Knight
Death Knight: Now, you will die together... How joyous...

%Hubert,Death Knight
Hubert: You should withdraw from here.
Death Knight: I don't take orders from you...

@End 
Death Knight: Kill them.
???: Halt. You're having a bit too much fun.
Death Knight: You are getting in the way of my game.
???: Hmph. You'll have more opportunities to play soon. Your work here is done.
Death Knight: Understood. I will go...
???: We will cross paths again. I am the Flame Emperor... It is I who will reforge the world.

Linhardt: Flame Emperor? Rather worrisome that he sounds intent on showing up again.
Ferdinand: Are they both OK? We should get them out of here.
Hubert: The enemy's withdrawn. Let's carry them up.

Mercedes: Flame Emperor and the Death Knight? I have to say, they both looked very dangerous.
Ingrid: Where did they go? It doesn't matter. We need to get these two out of here.
Dedue: Bring them up.

Lorenz: Flame Emperor, eh? Seemed quite frightened of us if you ask me! Haha!
Leonie: He's gone. We should get these two out of here.
Hilda: Let's get out of this horrible place! C'mon, we can carry them up.


^start 
Linhardt: They're pale, and their pulse are slow... Still, I don't believe their lives are in danger.
Edelgard: You found Flayn? Where?!
Ferdinand: You missed the most important part of the mission! We found her within that secret passage. The culprits were the Death Knight and...what was his name? Ah, the Flame Emperor. Sadly, they got away.
Edelgard: All that matters is Flayn's safety. Right, Professor?
Byleth: Right.
Byleth: I wanted to catch them.
Edelgard: It is unfortunate. If only you could have waited for me to return...
Hubert: We will take these two to the infirmary. Professor, please inform Seteth.
Edelgard: Whatever the circumstance, I'm glad Flayn is safe. Though I'm curious to find out who that other girl is... Huh, Professor? Is that...a smile?
Edelgard: Heh, you look...happy. I don't think I've ever seen you like this before. Anyhow, we should hurry to Seteth. He must be beside himself by now.

Mercedes: Thank goodness. Those girls are pale as ghosts, but at least they're alive. But that Death Knight person...feels so familiar.
Dimitri: You found Flayn?! Thank goodness!
Annette: She was unconscious at the end of that secret passage. We found the culprit too...but he got away.
Byleth: No use dwelling on it.
Byleth: We almost had him.
Dimitri: I'm just grateful that everyone is safe. That's what matters most. I'd like to hear what transpired, but first we need to get these ladies to the infirmary.
Dedue:  Understood. We'll go at once.
Dimitri:  I'm...I'm sorry, Professor. I'm so relieved, I suddenly felt weak. I couldn't be happier with how things turned out. And I imagine no one will be more overjoyed than Seteth. Hm. Hey, Professor. Can you make that expression one more time?
Byleth: Like this? 
Dimitri: I don't think I've ever seen your face like that.
Byleth: No.
Byleth: I don't think I can...
Dimitri: Heh, I apologize. I've forgotten myself and come dangerously close to teasing you. It's just...I've never seen you look so happy before. It's downright mesmerizing. Ah, but this isn't the time for idle chitchat. We must hurry and share the good news with Seteth!

Marianne: They're both alive... Thank goodness.
Claude: You actually found Flayn?! Nice work!
Lorenz: It is a shame you could not be there, Claude. I would have liked for you to witness our mortal struggle against the Death Knight.
Byleth: He got away.
Byleth: We could not defeat him.
Claude: Hey, at least we managed to rescue Flayn and complete our mission. That's what counts, right? Right! Excellent work, everyone! Now then, let's get these limp ladies to the infirmary, shall we?
Raphael: No problem. I can carry them both at once.
Lysithea: Be gentle with them, Raphael! Let us carry each one individually. And slowly.
Claude: You know, Teach, seeing you smile sure makes me feel better. You look happy for a change. Hm? Do you really not know? Well, truth is, I've never seen you smile before now. At times, it made me wonder whether you were even human. But I suppose that was just my imagination running wild. Anyhow, we've probably kept Seteth waiting about as long as he can stand. Let's hurry up and tell him the great news.
^end

@Dialogue 
Seteth: Professor... Please, allow me to express my eternal gratitude once more. Flayn is safe and sound, and I have you to thank for that. Mere words could never express how thankful I am. I...I am indebted to you.
Byleth: I couldn't have done it without the students.
Seteth: Yes, of course. I shall express my gratitude to the students as well.
Byleth: I'm just happy she's safe.
Seteth: Yes, indeed. I...I, too, am overjoyed.
Byleth: But why was Flayn taken to begin with?
Seteth: Her kidnapper was the masked knight who vanished during the Rite of Rebirth. The one known as the Death Knight. Considering the circumstances, it seems plausible to assume that his true identity is Jeritza. And we cannot forget about the mysterious Flame Emperor... His true motives are yet unclear. However, I have an idea. I believe the enemy may have been after Flayn's blood. The blood that flows through her veins is special. It is extremely rare...and extremely dangerous. If enemies who know the secret of Flayn's blood have appeared, our only option is to leave the monastery and go into hiding.

Flayn: Brother, wait.
Seteth: Flayn?! What are you doing here? You should be resting!
Flayn: I do not like the path of your thoughts. I do not wish to live in some lonely, remote location where I never get to see anyone. Not ever again.
Seteth: If we stay here, you may be targeted again! Wouldn't it be better for the two of us to live in peace?
Flayn: Even if we ran off to some new, secret location, there is no guarantee that they would not find us. That is why I believe it would be safest to stay in the monastery, where we are surrounded by capable knights and professors.
Seteth: I see your point, I do. However...
Flayn: You know it is the only reasonable option. What if I were to join the professor's class?
Byleth: That is a great idea. 
Flayn: You think so too? I am so very pleased to hear that! With a professor like you nearby, I shall be safe no matter what foe should appear!
Byleth: Why would you do that?
Flayn: Because, with a professor like you nearby, I shall be safe no matter what foe should appear!
Seteth: I see. I am afraid you have a good point. Professor... Due to my position, I have closely scrutinized everything about you. After all that has happened, I must admit that you are indeed...a trusted ally. So, what say you? Can I entrust you with Flayn's safety?
Byleth: It would be my pleasure. 
Byleth: I suppose I have no choice.
Sothis: I am so glad that Flayn is safe. Yet I can't help but wonder what the story is about the other girl. She wore the uniform of the academy. But who is she?

Rhea: Well done, Professor. I see that I was right to ask your class for assistance. I have been told that Manuela and Flayn are recovering nicely, as is Monica.
Byleth: Is Monica a student here?
Byleth: Who is Monica?
Rhea: Monica, the girl you rescued along with Flayn, is also a student at the Officers Academy. However...
Hanneman: She is a student from last year's class. She went missing just before she would have graduated. It never occurred to us that something might have happened to her at the monastery. We assumed she had run away. I never dreamed that we would find her. Not like this.
Rhea: Monica has asked to rejoin the Black Eagle House once she has fully recovered. Our enemies are still out there, so we must remain cautious and continue our investigation. However, we must also help the students to move on from this incident.
Hanneman: After all, the Battle of the Eagle and Lion will be held in Gronder Field next month.
Rhea: Yes. The students will remember it for the rest of their lives. Please guide them so they may show us their best at the coming battle.

Jeralt: So, you'll be going to Gronder Field next month. You've never been there before, have you? There is unease in the western side of the Empire, but everything east of the capital, Enbarr, is stable. Well, there was a noble rebellion a short while ago, but it didn't amount to much.
Byleth: What will you do next month?
Jeralt: I have my own mission. The church has always been quick to make use of those who work for them.
Byleth: Will you come to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion?
Jeralt: Sorry, but I've got my own mission, and it's far from Gronder Field. The church has always been quick to make use of those who work for them.
Jeralt: What I'm more concerned about is finding out who among us is pulling the strings. Ever since the Rite of Rebirth, strange groups have been seen around Garreg Mach, and elsewhere too. There was also an incident where some knights investigating these suspicious strangers...turned up dead. Not that it's likely, but if something like that ever happens to me... Search this room. Every corner. Behind every shelf. I'm going to leave something for you.
Byleth: Don't say things like that. 
Jeralt: Don't get me wrong. I have no intention of dying. I know it would be too much to ask you to cheer up, but can you at least drop the serious...  Well, I'll be. Was that a smile just now?
Byleth: I promise.
Jeralt: Don't just nod solemnly. There's nothing to worry about. I'm just being cautious. Then again, I guess you're always solemn. 
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Together, the people of FÃ³dlan relish the beauty of the brilliant moon overhead as another year ends. They recall sad partings and new acquaintances alike, but each person must still walk their chosen path alone. With each day, the presence of spring grows stronger and yet a lone moon still haunts the sky. A silent reminder, perhaps, of some inescapable truth...

@Dialogue 
Rhea: Unforgivable! I cannot believe that the Adrestian Empire would embark on such a violent course of action.
Seteth: The fault is my own. I failed to see the wickedness within Edelgard's heart.
Byleth: Is she wicked?
Seteth: She plotted with ill-meaning strangers to achieve her own ambitions and defiled the Holy Tomb. If that is not wicked, what is?
Byleth: What is her objective?
Seteth: There is no question on that front. She clearly wishes to conquer all of FÃ³dlan. And in order to achieve her own selfish ambitions, she plotted with ill-meaning strangers and defiled the Holy Tomb.
Seteth: Or perhaps her ambitions are even grander than we know. Perhaps she is planning to make herself a false deity by demonizing the Church of Seiros...
Rhea: Adrestia received its very name through a divine oracle. To injure the goddess is a sin most foul that shall not be forgiven nor forgotten. We must stop the Empire...and quickly.
Shamir: I have returned, Rhea.
Rhea: Welcome back, Shamir. Were you able to discern the Empire's movements?
Shamir: Their main troops are marching towards Garreg Mach. It is said that they will join forces with Edelgard's army and arrive within two weeks.
Seteth: Two weeks? That is not enough time! It will require all of our efforts just to prepare our defenses before then. We must send notice to all surrounding villages at once. We must order the residents of Garreg Mach to flee for their lives.
Shamir: It will be done.

Rhea: ...Professor...listen closely. If our enemy invades the monastery, I will have no choice but to stand upon the battlefield. If something happens to me...I am entrusting my sacred duties to you.
Byleth: Why me?
Byleth: Sacred duties?
Rhea: You must have guessed it by now. The truth of who you are. Or perhaps I should say, your lost memories are surely beginning to return. I have acted all these long years as a mere proxy for you. But the duty is yours and yours alone. Only you can lead the people of FÃ³dlan.
Seteth: ...Rhea, please. You must tell me all that you know. I beg of you.
Rhea: ...
Seteth: That one...is the progenitor god. Am I correct?
Rhea: In a sense. Our dear professor is...a vessel. One who carries the power of the progenitor god within. In time, the vessel will become one with the power contained within, and the progenitor god shall return to this world.
Seteth: I see. I trust that you are aware of the questionable nature of this experiment? But I suppose there is no turning back...
Rhea: I ask that you help our friend...and in doing so, help her. I am waiting and hoping for the moment when our creator rules this wayward land once more.
Seteth: I am sorry, but I cannot do this. I am not certain it is just...
Rhea: I see. That is a shame.
Seteth: I understand. As ever, I will take you at your word.
Flayn: Lady Rhea! Brother! I will do my part as well!
Seteth: Flayn! Were you eavesdropping? Regardless, I am glad to hear it. You owe your life to the professor, after all. And in the end, they may prove to be our brethren.
Rhea: You have my gratitude, Seteth. And you as well, Flayn. As followers of the progenitor god, it is up to us to see our mission through.

@Conversation 
Dimitri: ... I'll have that girl's head. Just you wait...



Claude: The Empire is moving quickly. Edelgard must have been preparing for this for a while now. If you really think about it, she must have been planning for this even before you got the Sword of the Creator... Of course she was always a step ahead of us. We were blinded by the ball and the Battle of the Eagle and Lion, and everything else...



Ferdinand: Half of the Empire's six great noble families have declared their support for Edelgard. Of the other three, Lord Vestra was assassinated. Hubert, his son, will succeed him. Bernadetta's father, Count Varley, is under house arrest. His wife is now supporting Edelgard. And my father...he was stripped of his role as prime minister. As as result, House Aegir has lost all of its power, all of its land. We have lost everything. I...I... What do I do?



Linhardt: The most important nobles in the Empire are known for taking power from the previous emperor, my father included. I didn't think it possible that the Imperial princess could ascend the throne so easily. However, it seems that both my father and Caspar's are supporting Edelgard... Having both the Minister of Domestic Affairs and Minister of Military Affairs on your side gives you total control over the Empire's military and finances. They must have been making preparations for quite some time without anyone noticing...



Caspar: I don't normally have a problem jumping into a fight, but it feels strange going up against my father. We aren't especially close, but he's not an opponent I'd want to face. I'd almost rather fight a monster! I hope he's not part of the group coming to attack Garreg Mach...



Bernadetta: What does war with Edelgard mean for us, Professor? And why does she even want that?
Byleth: I don't know.
Bernadetta: Yeah, I guess we'd have to ask her.
Byleth: She seems to think force is the only way.
Bernadetta: I wonder why she'd think that...
Bernadetta: That's how it always goes, I guess. You never realize something can't be undone until you've done it.



Dorothea: Edelgard became emperor and raised an army, huh? Who knew the kid had it in her? I mean, yeah, of course, I knew she'd be emperor eventually, but... The more I think about it, the more surprised I am. I wonder who's going to win...
Byleth: Us or her, you mean?
Dorothea: But would it really be OK for Edelgard to win?
Byleth: We will not lose. 
Dorothea: Thinking about it makes me scared. We're up against the entire Imperial army! Still, I know someone as smart as you will figure something out...




Petra: I am owing big debts to Duke Gerth of the Empire. He is the Minister of Affairs that are Foreign. He is a friend of Edelgard. He is to her side. What should I be doing?

Petra: I have had the arrival of a letter from Edelgard. She is asking...that I join her side. She is making the decision...no, she is deciding if Brigid is a friend or an enemy of the Empire. But my choice is not to be friends. My choice is to fight with you. Brigid is not a friend of the Empire. We will not be following again. We will be ready to fight with you instead.



Dedue: His Highness calls for the head of Edelgard. For me, that is cause enough to fight.
Byleth: That is against the teachings of the goddess.
Dedue: Perhaps. But it is too late to stop him now.
Byleth: You're truly all right with that? 
Dedue: The hatred of His Highness is also my hatred. Any other feelings I may have are irrelevant.
Dedue: And if Edelgard was responsible in any way for the Tragedy of Duscur, that is something I cannot ignore. If that is the case, then she is my enemy.



Felix: You saw it too, didn't you? The boar's true nature. He's hidden his desire for revenge pretty well. But now it's stirred up. Well, regardless. That girl's starting an all-out war, isn't she? But an enemy is an enemy, no matter who they are. Don't let compassion for her get in your way.

Annette: Once the Imperial army reaches the monastery, we'll have no choice but to fight...
Ashe: What's going to happen to us?
Byleth: Everything will be all right. 
Ashe: I believe you. With the knights on our side, and especially with you, Professor, I know we can do this!
Byleth: I can't say for sure.
Annette: Oh. Well, we'll just have to try our best.



Sylvain: Things must be pretty crazy in Faerghus about now. My father must be beside himself. I don't get it. Why did Edelgard make enemies with the nobles?
Byleth: I have no idea. 
Sylvain: Me either... Of course, even if we did get it, what do we do about it?
Byleth: For the sake of her ideals?
Sylvain: Ideals she believes in so much she was willing to start a war over them? Those must be some lofty ideals, to say the least.
Sylvain: I hope this all gets sorted out quickly and safely. I'm worried about my father.



Mercedes: I guess we have no choice but to fight, have we? Oh, but why would Edelgard do something like this? I'm sure we'll be all right though, Professor. The goddess will keep us safe.



Ingrid: I've known His Highness since I was a child, but I've never seen that side of him before. He seemed like a completely different person than the one I know...



Lorenz: The Empire's aggression cannot stand. But if we are going to attack them now, we must be honest with ourselves about our chances of success. It goes without saying that I will fight the Imperial army with everything I have, for as long as I am able. But House Gloucester's territory is adjacent to Imperial lands. Let us proceed with caution.



Raphael: I hear the Alliance's territory will be in danger if we don't get rid of these Empire guys! If the Alliance is in danger, that means my sister's in danger too! There's no way I'm gonna allow that. It doesn't matter how many guys they throw at us, I'll beat 'em all! These muscles aren't just for show! But first, I gotta get some food.



Ignatz: You know, Professor, I'm glad that I came to the Officers Academy. I feel accepted here. I've learned so much. Honestly, I'm surprised at how much I've grown. So, I will not let the academy be destroyed. It's important to me, and I will protect it!
Byleth: I feel the same. 
Ignatz: I feel braver just hearing you say that, Professor.
Byleth: Don't do anything rash.
Ignatz: I'll try to keep a clear head, but there won't be any turning back for me. I don't want to have regrets.
Ignatz: We're gonna win this, Professor!



Lysithea: So Edelgard, the one who calls herself the Flame Emperor, was connected to those strange beings. The Imperial army might be using even more terrifying methods than we know. You had better be cautious, Professor. Any amount of carelessness might prove to be our undoing.



Marianne: Can we really defeat someone who is willing to turn their back on the world just to uphold their own beliefs? I've spent my whole life running in fear, and now...I...
Byleth: We can win this together.
Marianne: Surely we can win if we rely on each other. Right, Professor?
Byleth: We can't win if you run. 
Marianne: You're right. It's time to stop running. I'll fight with everything I've got!




Hilda: You'll battle Edelgard, right? Good luck! Me? Oh, I'm going to run away. I have zero interest in dying here, thank you very much.

Hilda: At times like this, I just feel so anxious, you know? But you'll watch out for me there. Right, Professor?



Leonie: What is Edelgard even trying to achieve? She wants to destroy the church so badly that she'll take on anyone who doesn't fall in line? I don't get it.
Byleth: Her ideals are in conflict with yours. 
Byleth: It's a hard thing to accept.
Leonie: I just can't believe she'd start a war over it. Not to mention using such nasty tactics to get her way. Could Captain Jeralt's death have also been a part of her plan? Don't you go and die on me, Professor. Captain Jeralt would never forgive you.



Rhea: How are you, Professor? Any new changes to report? With the Imperial army drawing near, it is most vexing that we cannot relax and converse as we once did... Thankfully, you have the divine protection of the goddess on your side. Please try to listen carefully for her voice...
Byleth: I will try. 
Byleth: I can't hear a thing.
Rhea: Please do not say such sad things. I am certain you will hear her in time.
Rhea: May the goddess's voice reach you...



Seteth: We must protect Garreg Mach. Defiling the Holy Tomb was a sacrilege. I will not allow such a thing to happen again. The archbishop has already given you a new responsibility. I want you to rise to that honor.



Flayn: Professor... War is breaking out again, is it not?
Byleth: Again?
Flayn: There was a truly terrible war, once upon a time.
Byleth: I want to stop it if I can.
Flayn: An honorable notion. Do you think there is something to be done? Whatever shall we do?
Flayn: I never wanted another war... All we can do is steel ourselves for the fight ahead.



Alois: Well, perhaps it's pointless to get upset about the past. My duty now is to prepare for battle. We're depending on your strength, Professor. Crush our enemies!
Byleth: I'll try
Byleth: I'm depending on you. 
Alois: Captain, I hope you're watching! We will protect Garreg Mach!



Catherine: Ugh. If I could go back to last month and throttle my carefree self! Now it turns out Edelgard is the Flame Emperor, and the new Adrestian emperor! And she's striking out against the monastery, with the full force of the Imperial army behind her. We gotta beat her at her own game! For our sake as well as Lady Rhea's...



Shamir: We're falling behind. I don't know that we can keep up with the new emperor. To think that she was able to raise an army of that size right under our noses... However hard we fight, I give us a 50 percent chance of winning. The enemy has too many advantages. We must make careful preparations.



Gilbert: There are always small power struggles, still... It has been hundreds of years since all of FÃ³dlan was consumed by war. I didn't actually think it would come to this... I feel as though I'm not in my rightful place. I cannot protect the things I should... Professor. If I survive this war, I wish to return to my homeland... To the land of my king.



Hanneman: The Holy Tomb held many Crest Stones. This is the first time I've heard of Crest Stones being hidden away in such a place... But more importantly, I'm interested to know the Empire's aim. Why would their army desire Crest Stones? There is power there, yes. And yet... I must think on this. The Crest Stones lie at the heart of the events surrounding Conand Tower and the chapel as well... And of course, the Crest Stones somehow transformed those traitors and their captives into Demonic Beasts... Could that possibly be their aim?! The Empire's army may well plan to use Crest Stones to create Demonic Beasts!



Manuela: The mastermind behind the attacks on the monastery was Edelgard? Wow. Doesn't make much sense though, does it? There would need to be all sorts of territories and groups tangled up in this sort of mess... Eh, I'm gonna stop. I don't really have the head for this political stuff. Mostly I'm worried about my old opera company. I wonder what's happening in the capital right now. I hope they're safe...



Cyril: It's my job to protect Lady Rhea. I've gotta do it. and I gotta do it as best I can. And if that means I gotta die for her, then I will. Ugh, how could Edelgard treat Lady Rhea like she's the bad guy? She's never been anything but nice to everybody! I just don't get it at all...



Anna: I can't believe the Empire raised an army... Even I couldn't have guessed it. War is profitable...but dangerous. I really don't like seeing people I care about out there mixed up in all this.



Gatekeeper: Greetings Professor! Something to report! Unexpected, isn't it? Apparently, this is the first time Garreg Mach has been invaded in its whole 995-year history! It's my job to protect this gate, so even if enemies come in droves, I will never let them through! I hope we both survive... Let's battle with all our might and pray we win this thing!


@Intro 
Alois: Listen up, everyone! The Imperial army is upon us. If you can fight, pick up a weapon! Everyone else, hurry up and evacuate! We have the goddess's protection on our side. We have nothing to fear. Victory will be ours!
Catherine: Professor. Are you ready?
Byleth: Almost.
Catherine: Well, hurry up. I don't need to tell you that the situation is dire. We have some support troops from the local nobles, but the army we're facing is immense. No matter how you look at it, we're at a disadvantage. To make matters worse, the enemy is being led by Edelgard. Do not underestimate how extraordinary her abilities are.
^start
Linhardt: Of course we know, but we can't let her get away. Also, please cease your unwarranted glaring. We don't deserve your judgement.
Ferdinand: My father was removed from his role as prime minister and is still under house arrest in the Imperial capital. As his successor...it is my duty to stop her!
Caspar: The way she's going about all of this is wrong. It's up to us to help her realize that!
Bernadetta: I won't be following her, but...l won't run away either!
Dorothea: Edie's going to come at us with all she's got. And that's a lot. That means we need to fight her with all of our might too.
Petra: She is one who has strength, that has certainty. But we have strength also. We will not be losing!
Flayn: I shall fight with all that I have. It is an honor to fight alongside each of you!
Catherine: You students really have guts, don't you? Though, I suppose I can't call you students anymore. You're now part of our order. You have our support and our gratitude. Professor, I'm counting on you. Go ahead and take the lead.
Byleth: Leave it to me.
Byleth: I'll protect the students.
Catherine: These kids...they look up to you. I guess that goes without saying. Just look in their eyes and you can see it. If we all make it through this, let's meet again. Good luck out there!

Dimitri: They're here. At long last.
Felix: It seems this will be a battle to remember. About time.
Ashe: I'll never give up, no matter how outnumbered we are. I'll fight to the very end!
Sylvain: Hm, I should have made a move on the Imperial princess before things got this far. It could have changed everything.
Mercedes: We have the goddess's divine protection on our side. All that's left to do is to try our best.
Annette: All we can do is fight as best as we can. Though...if I'm being honest, I'm really scared right now...
Ingrid: We can't just hand over the Kingdom and the monastery. We'll stop her, no matter what it takes!
Dedue: Your Highness, you do not seem...well.
Dimitri:   Unwell, you say? What's gotten into you? Nothing could be further from the truth. I'm so happy I can hardly contain myself. My father, my stepmother, my dear friends? They want her head. They want her life! They've whispered as much to me. And the chance to answer their pleas has arrived, at long last!
Byleth: Don't lose control out there.
Dimitri:   I'm always in control, Professor! And I'll stay in control until I have the pleasure of killing that woman!
Byleth: Don't act rashly. We're all in this together.
Dimitri:   Of course, of course! But don't mistake my intentions. Edelgard will die by my hand, and mine alone.
Dimitri: Let's move, Professor. Even if it costs me my life, I won't rest until I've crushed her skull in my bare hands!

Hilda: She's back already? Talk about impatient!
Claude: If we don't stop them, the academy will be destroyed. Prepare for battle, everyone!
Lysithea: We will stop Edelgard's rampage!
Ignatz: Our opponent is formidable, but if we work together, we will not fail.
Raphael: Enough talking! Let's go!
Marianne: Dear Goddess... Please, protect us all...
Flayn: I shall fight with all that I have. It is an honor to fight alongside each of you!
Hilda: Professor, Claude... You'll lead the way, won't you? You won't let any of us fall, right?
Claude: I wanted to talk to Rhea first, but as expected, that won't be possible. What did she hope to accomplish at the Holy Tomb? What happened to you as a baby? There are still so many things I need to know. The same goes for the real origin of the Crest Stones and the Heroes' Relics. As for Seiros and Nemesis...just how much of their mythology is true?
Claude: It's true. But lucky for me, I refuse to die with so much still unknown. Hey, Teach... All joking aside. Can we possibly survive this battle?
Byleth: We'll find a way.
Claude: That's all we can do, right? If we gave up, the god of fate wouldn't be happy.
Byleth: I don't know.
Claude: Hey, now! I wasn't really looking for an honest answer. Honesty is bad for morale, Teach. You'd better cut that out.
Claude: I'm a lot of things, but I'm not the kind of man to just roll over and die in a place like this. I have my own ambitions to see to. There are things...dreams...that I must see come to fruition. And I've been thinking. I want you to see those dreams realized as well. On top of all that, there are still so many secrets out there, just waiting to be uncovered. We can't let that stand, can we? 
Claude: So, Teach... No, scratch that. You're so much more. You're my ally and my friend. Teach... Friend... None of those words quite capture what you've come to mean to me. We may not be connected by blood, but I believe our bond goes deeper than that. Now that we know each other, our hearts are connected. Even if our paths diverge and we're forced to say good-bye... I know that we'll meet again. 
Claude: And so, for lack of a better word, I gratefully call you my friend, and I hold fast to the belief that this isn't it for us. No matter who or what you really are, I'll always be on your side. You can't count on much in this world, but you can count on that.

@Opening 
The Imperial army, led by Edelgard, advances on Garreg Mach. As everyone struggles to process this turn of events, the grim reality of war fast approaches.

@Battle 
Knight of Seiros: I have a report! The enemy is within the walls. They're about to break the defensive line!
Dedue: The archbishop and the defensive line both require our assistance. We must protect them until reinforcements get here.

Knight of Seiros: Report! The enemy has taken the entrances there the reinforcements were heading!
Dedue: We must retake the strongholds to the east and west so our reinforcements can get through.

Dedue: One stronghold secured.

Dedue: Both strongholds secured, with time to spare.

Seteth: Alright, that's one stronghold recaptured. Now, the other!

Seteth: That's both strongholds! It appears we were right on time.

Seteth: Noâthe monestary has fallen! We've been defeated...

Catherine: I'm here, and I've brought reinforcements! Don't worry--we'll protect the monastery! 

Shamir: I brought reinforcements. I'll send them to the front line. 

Dedue: They have taken the monastery. We have lost...

Claude: We took back one of the strongholds. On to the next...

Claude: All right, we took back both of the strongholds. Let's keep up the momentum!

Claude: Damn it... The monastery has fallen into the hands of our enemy. We failed.

Rhea: The goddess protects us... what is there to fear rebel swords... This is blasphemy against the goddess! Stop this now!

Rhea: N-no... I cannot fall here...


Randolph: A wonderful chance to earn some recognition! I'll be the one to take down the monastery!

@Boss 
Randolph: I have no choice but to distinguish myself in this fight!

Randolph: Argh! I'm finished. I'm loathe to say it, but I must retreat...

Hubert: Such a shame. There are people in the Empire you truly care about, too, aren't there? I wonder what will become of them.

Hubert: What you fail to appreciate is that we have, at our backs, a force you cannot hope to defeat.

Hubert: I can afford to fall back. We still have the advantage.

Death Knight: This fight is but a sideshow... to the ravaging of the sacred place that is Garreg Mach...

Death Knight: The time is not right... I will wait for the next opportunity...

Ladislava: I will not allow you to get any closer to Her Majesty!

Ladislava: My life was changed forever by Her Majesty... Now, I lay it on the line. For the Empire!

Ladislava: Lady Edelgard, I'm so sorry! I can't keep going! I must retreat!

Edelgard: Think very carefully about whether you wish to raise your sword against the Empire... or if you will offer it to us in fealty. And after you've thought it through, if you still wish to fight, I won't stop you. I will simply use the full extent of my power... and crush you.

Edelgard: You will come to regret raising your blade against the emperor of the Adrestian Empire!

%Caspar,Randolph 
Caspar: Huh. This guy seems real familiar...
Randolph: Y-you dastard! Aren't you... No...
Caspar: Eh, that doesn't matter right now. Let's go!

%Byleth,Hubert
Hubert: Lady Edelgard held you in such high esteem. In the end, however, it seems like you are nothing more than a slave to your goddess.

%Byleth,Death Knight
Death Knight: This battlefield is too chaotic... for us to kill each other upon...

%Byleth,Edelgard
Edelgard: I wish you were someone whose heart could be swayed by my words and deeds. If it were so, I would have done anything to make you my ally...

%Dimitri,Edelgard
Dimitri: You're late. I... We are all tired of waiting. Now, let's separate that sick head from your neck, shall we?
Edelgard: Heh. You never were one for patience.

@End 
Edelgard: You fought well. But now, your fight is over. Send in our reserve troops! And give my uncle the signal!
Rhea: What... is this?!

@Cutscene 
Rhea: Everyone here, young and old, is in your hands.

Rhea: No. I will not allow another Red Canyon tragedy to happen here.

Claude: What is going on?

Empire Soldier: What now?

Rhea: Why did you come?!

@Narration 
In Imperial Year 1181, the New Adrestian Emperor, Edelgard von Hresvelg, led a strategic assault against the monastery at Garreg Mach. Though her own losses were great, her foes had no choice but to surrender. Archbishop Rhea commanded the Knights of Seiros, leading from the front lines against the Imperial Army. But amidst the chaos of battle, she vanished, and her whereabouts remain unknown. With this single attack, the Adrestian Empire officially launched its offensive against the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus and the Leicester Alliance. The unification of FÃ³dlan has begun.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
The northern lands are enveloped in a bitter cold, and frigid winds are carried across the sea to the south of Adrestia. When feather-white snow falls on FÃ³dlan's Locket, the fort looks as delicate as a pearl. However....beneath that snowy blanket, her Throat is more treacherous than ever.

@Dialogue
Seteth: Rhea, please talk to me. What are you hiding? What is the meaning of how that one looks? It is almost as though...
Rhea: As I said, there is nothing of which to speak. For now. At the end of this month...
Seteth: I read Jeralt's diary. I happened upon it in his room.
Rhea: What?
Seteth: In it, he stated the reason for his departure. The baby thought to have died in the fire...has returned to us. Jeralt realized that you had done something to the child and decided to flee. What did you do to that baby, Rhea? Nothing...questionable, I should hope?
Rhea: Seteth, enough. They will be here shortly. No more, I beg of you. I will take our dear professor to the Holy Tomb. There...I should be able to see our dearest wishes to fruition. When I was young, I heard her voice there... I'm sure of it.
Rhea: You may enter.
Rhea: I have been awaiting your arrival, Professor. Now that you have received sacred power from the goddess, there is somewhere you must pay a visit to at once. You must go to the Holy Tomb so that you may receive a divine revelation from the goddess.
Byleth: The Holy Tomb?
Byleth: A revelation?
Seteth: The Holy Tomb is where the goddess sleeps. This monastery was originally built for the purpose of protecting that hallowed temple.
Rhea: Only a select few know of it, but there is a legend about Seiros and the Holy Tomb. Saint Seiros, the first soul to be gifted power from the goddess, received her revelation there. She was told it was her sacred duty to save the people of FÃ³dlan, and that she must use her power wisely in order to lead them. The words that were handed down to Seiros from the goddess will likely fall upon your ears as well.
Seteth: Prepare yourself to go at once. There, may you find out why you were blessed with such power.
Rhea: There will be a ceremony at the Holy Tomb. It is then that you will receive the goddess's revelation. You may share this mission with your students.
Byleth: Do you think it wise to bring them into this?
Byleth: A mission? Now?
Rhea: It is said that when Seiros received the revelation, she had holy warriors by her side, protecting her. Your students, who have followed you and fought alongside you through the darkest of times, are well suited to stand by you for the ceremony. Of course, as the leader of the Church of Seiros, I will be by your side as well.
Byleth: Strange...
Rhea: The occasion is too significant to be missed.
Byleth: Isn't that too dangerous? 
Rhea: The Holy Tomb is a sacred temple that is sealed off from the rest of the world. There is nothing to fear.
Rhea: Even if something were to happen, I am more than capable of protecting myself.
Seteth: Much has changed, but your duty has not wavered. Steel your mind for the ceremony, and prepare your students well.

Claude: Rhea and Seteth were not their usual selves. What happened to Teach that's questionable, and what really awaits at the Holy Tomb? The way they were acting, I don't think they have any plans of sharing that information.

@Conversation 
Byleth: (I can't hear Sothis's voice anymore...)

Edelgard: Professor, you should know that I'll be away from the monastery for a few days.
Byleth: Where are you going?
Edelgard: It's meant to be a secret, but...I'm going to Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Don't worry, I'll be back in time for the ceremony at the Holy Tomb.

Dedue: Professor. Please. If he hears it from you that he needs to rest, perhaps His Highness will listen.
Dimitri: He's exaggerating. He thinks my color is off and that rest will cure all. I have a headache, but that's just from lack of sleep. It's not going to stop me from completing this month's mission.
Byleth: You should rest. 
Dedue: The professor agrees. Please rest. At least until the task is at hand.
Dimitri: I won't. Even if I tried, it's not like I would get any decent sleep. It would only be a waste of time.
Byleth: Don't overexert yourself.
Dedue: I must insistâ
Dimitri: Who do you think you are? I can take care of myself, Dedue.
Dimitri: In any case, we won't let you down this month, Professor. You can rely on us.




Claude: Hey, Teach. Is it OK for you to be out on your own right now? Just...please be careful not to topple over again. You scared us nearly to death. Anyway... Doesn't Rhea want something from you? Sounds important. I'm glad I'll be there to witness the ritual at the Holy Tomb. I want to see whether or not something happens with my own eyes.



Claude: I always knew there was something special about you, but you've only gotten more and more extraordinary the longer I've know you. That transformation was just the beginning, wasn't it? I have a feeling that things will only grow more dire from here on out.





Ferdinand: Edelgard and Hubert have been busier than usual. Constantly coming and going, in and out of Garreg Mach. Perhaps they are doing something in the Empire? As the legitimate heir of the Aegir family, I have not heard anything about it. But if it were significant, I am sure my father would have told me.



Linhardt: How are you, Professor? Did Hanneman make his, I will do no harm speech or promise this won't hurt a bit when he asked to study you? Both? I've a bit of research I'd like to perform. Nothing so crass as Hanneman's poking, prodding, and drawing of blood. No, I wish to investigate Crest power itself. Crest power must have some kind of limit, right? Lady Rhea says any limits must be the protection of the goddess, but that doesn't quite answer it for me. Hmm...



Caspar: You're so strong now! I'm starting to understand why you were appointed professor.

Caspar: I thought I was stronger, but I still have such a long way to go.
Byleth: Try to catch up to me. 
Caspar: Oh, I will. I still plan on beating you some day!
Byleth: I'll help you get there.
Caspar: You'd better not go easy on me. I need your training to be strict if I'm gonna get any better!

Bernadetta: So hungry... Oh, is that you, Professor? Sorry. I'm really not feeling well this month. Even leaving my room for dinner is just too much. It's got nothing to do with your, um...changes. So, um, don't open the door, please!



Dorothea: Recently, Professor, I feel as though you've been a bit distant. It's like you're sort of floating above the clouds, separate from other people... And like you've got no interest at all in ever coming back down. How can I help?
Byleth: I'm not being distant, so don't worry.
Byleth: I don't know what to say to that. 
Dorothea: Hey, don't worry. I thought maybe I'd ask and see what you'd say.



Petra: In Brigid, we have legends. Stories containing people who have a spirit living inside of them. Those spirit people have much strength. They are maybe able to fly in the air or race across the ocean. Hair that shines and eyes that glow... They have qualities that are not unlike what you are looking like, Professor.
Byleth: I can't fly.
Petra: Are you knowing that for certain? Maybe you will have wings that grow and soar through the sky...
Byleth: Perhaps. 
Petra: Do not have doubt, Professor. The powers you have are like the powers of the legends.



Felix: Hurry up and cage the wild boar. Look, he's losing his grip. Even in his swordplay, he's getting sloppy. If he keeps progressing like this, he's going to get himself killed. Kronya, Solon... They're dead, but we still have a glut of enemies. We still have to take down the Death Knight and the Flame Emperor. Our next battle is fast approaching. I'm ready for it.



Ashe: I can't even imagine what it must be like inside the Holy Tomb.
Byleth: I don't know either. 
Ashe: Well, it's probably a grave, that much is for sure. And it's likely underground. Beyond that, who knows?
Byleth: It's just a place to bury people.
Ashe: I guess you're right. Holy or not, all graves are kind of the same, aren't they?
Ashe: I can't help but wonder though... Just what kind of ritual is this?



Sylvain: I swear, it's like you're an entirely different person.
Byleth: I haven't changed on the inside.
Sylvain: Heh, I guess you're right. If I look hard, I can still tell it's you.
Byleth: Isn't it weird? 
Sylvain:  No, not at all! I'm just not used to it. It really suits you though.
Sylvain:  It's not weird at all. It's... You're somehow even more beautiful than before. I'm joking! I'm joking! Don't get mad.

Ingrid: You've been granted this power by the goddess herself. Truly, you must be a very special individual. Maybe Seiros transformed before receiving her revelation too!
Mercedes: Hmm. I haven't heard anything about that before... Maybe that part never found its way into the legend?
Ingrid: It is told that Seiros had a revelation instructing her to use her power for good, and to lead the people of FÃ³dlan to salvation... I wonder what sort of revelation you might have, Professor.



Annette: Bah! Professor! Sorry, this will take some getting used to... Your hair and eye color are completely different! You just don't look like yourself anymore.
Byleth: It's only my appearance that has changed. 
Annette: Of course. You're right. I'm just being silly, as usual.
Byleth: Maybe I am a different person...
Annette: Don't scare me like that! You are still you...right? You are, right?



Lorenz: To be honest, I cannot keep up with all that's been happening recently. Monica was actually Kronya. Tomas was actually Solon. Who were these people? What about you, Professor? You are a true ally, yes?
Byleth: That's my intention. 
Lorenz: Not the most convincing answer you could have given. Still, I simply must take you at your word.
Byleth: I don't know.
Lorenz: Pull yourself together! It is still your duty to lead us, is it not?



Raphael: You look so...different. You're still our professor in there, right? Did anything else change besides your hair and eyes? Are your arms bigger? How do your abs look?
Byleth: I've changed quite a bit. 
Raphael: Really?! You gotta teach me how to do that!
Byleth: I haven't changed that much.
Raphael: That's disappointing. What's even the point?




Ignatz: So, this month's mission is to take part in a ritual at the Holy Tomb, where you will receive a revelation from the goddess herself. What if she really appears? What if I finally get to gaze upon her radiance? I've always imagined the goddess--how beautiful she must be!

Ignatz: You're going to the ritual at the Holy Tomb, right? I hear that a revelation from the goddess is expected. What if she shows herself? I'll be so jealous!



Lysithea: Your hair! And your eyes! What happened to you?! You didn't lose something as a result of gaining those powers, did you?
Byleth: Don't worryâI'm fine. 
Lysithea: I see. Well, that makes me feel better. But still, be careful.
Byleth: I don't know yet.
Lysithea: Sometimes our frail bodies donât do well with excess power... So donât push yourself too hard.

Marianne: Long ago, Saint Seiros was gifted with a divine revelation from the goddess, as well as incredible power. Is that what happened to you too, Professor?
Hilda: No way! The professor transformed before receiving any kind of divine revelation, right? Still, I wonder. Does the fact that you've changed really mean you've been granted some kind of power?
Marianne: If that's the case, then what sort of revelation can be gained from the ritual?
Hilda: I'm guessing the revelation will just be a gentle reminder to use this new power to save the people of FÃ³dlan. What else is there to say? You don't actually believe we're going to hear the voice of the goddess, do you?



Leonie: When you changed, even the other professors were taken completely by surprise. There's a ritual at the Holy Tomb this month, isn't there? I wonder what will happen with that. I'm sure you'll be all right. But don't lose sight of who you really are, OK? However you may change, and whatever new power goes along with those changes--you'll still be the same person, deep down. Remember that.



Rhea: You haven't a thing to worry about. You have been gifted the power of the goddess. Furthermore, you have overcome the death of your father, Jeralt...and you have destroyed countless of our wicked foes. I am proud...so very proud of who you have become.
Byleth: Thank you. 
Rhea: Once we finish the ritual at the Holy Mausoleum, all will be well.
Byleth: I'm uneasy.
Rhea: That is understandable. Just know that your unease should disappear the moment we conclude the ritual at the Holy Mausoleum.



Seteth: Hmm... Ah. It is you. I am sorry, but I have a lot on my mind. I would prefer to be alone right now.



Flayn: Professor, I am so happy. Your new hair and eye color suit you well. We make quite the pair! But...recently I sense that things are a bit strained between Lady Rhea and my brother. She wants to do something at the Holy Tomb. I do not know what, but... Hm. Whenever it has concluded, I hope they will return to their friendship, as it has always been...



Alois: Captain... Oh, Professor! How long have you been standing there? I didn't see you. I was just sorting through Captain Jeralt's belongings. I... Haven't made much progress. I keep finding things that bring back memories. Clearing out this room of his belongings again, it's... It's not easy.



Catherine: In our battle last month, we really cut the enemy down to size. But there are other enemies we have yet to hunt down, not the least the Flame Emperor. Once we've crushed them all, we can return to our peaceful lives at the monastery. It will happen soon. I have a feeling something big is coming.



Shamir: People who live an inordinately long time, people whose hair changes color, and those odd Heroes' Relics... Is FÃ³dlan some mystical land full of inhuman creatures?
Byleth: It's not like that.
Shamir: You still look human. For now, at least.
Byleth: Is the world different outside FÃ³dlan? 
Shamir: You should see for yourself. I'd recommend exploring west of the Empire.



Gilbert: Sometimes, I find myself thinking I should leave Garreg Mach and return to my home... Where I should have been all along.
Byleth: Where you should have been? 
Gilbert: Ignore me. I'm sorry...it's a silly thing. An old man's ramblings, and nothing more.
Byleth: I won't stop you...
Gilbert: I hear that Lady Rhea will accompany you for this month's task. She's the pillar that supports the hearts of FÃ³dlan's people. Her safety is paramount. I hope there are no complications...



Hanneman: Are you positive? Really? Your appearance is due to the influence of the Crest of Flames? Intriguing. Unfortunately, I have found no record of Nemesis's hair and eye color ever changing. However... If that transformation was brought on, in part, by the power of the Crest, that would be most... Well, I suppose interesting is too small a word. Still, it would be an absolutely exceptional discovery. To know for certain, we must investigate further. So, clothes off!
Byleth: ...
Hanneman: What? A full physical is in order, yes? We need to know if this transformation affected you adversely. Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit.




Manuela: The Holy Tomb, huh? I've worked here for years, and this is the first I've heard of it. I mean, it does make some sense. Sort of. Something about it is still weird. I understand now why they'd build the monastery in the mountainous center of FÃ³dlan. Although... When the monastery was built, the Kingdom and the Alliance weren't even around yet. But look how cleverly it was placed right in the middle of the Empire, Kingdom, and Alliance. That's weird, right?



Cyril: When I first saw you, Professor, with that hair color and that eye color? I thought you looked kind of like Lady Rhea. Like maybe you could be related. I like the way it looks! I wonder if I could change my hair color too... Maybe if I tried hard enough. If I thought real hard about it, I mean.
Byleth: That would be exciting, wouldn't it? 
Cyril: All I need to do is get trapped up in a strange place and then escape, right? Just like you did.
Byleth: You don't need to do that, Cyril.
Cyril: I might not need to, but I still wanna.



Anna: Hey, Professor. You seem...different. Lots of things seem...different around here lately. I've noticed it. Have you?



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Although I suppose...you are something to report! For a moment, I thought you were someone suspicious! Lucky for you, I am quite perceptive. It took only that single moment for me to recognize you.  The professor went out and got some new power!

@Dialogue 
^locked 
Edelgard: Professor, will you join me? There's something I must do. It will take a few days, but I promise we'll be back in time for the ceremony at the Holy Tomb.
Byleth: Where are we going?
Edelgard: It's meant to be a secret, but...I'm going to Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. There is something I must do there.
Byleth: I'll go with you.
Edelgard: Thank you, my teacher.

Edelgard: Father, forgive me for asking this of you. I know how much pain you're in--how the burden of the throne weighs heavily on you--and so--
Emperor Ionius IX: There is no need to apologize, Edelgard. You must know...  that I do not have much time left in this world. The time has come. 
Edelgard: Thank you, Father. Now, to complete the Imperial succession, you must relinquish your crown here in the throne room. The archbishop of the Church of Seiros would normally act as witness, but my professor will fill that role instead.
Emperor Ionius IX: Edelgard...
Edelgard: From this day forward, the weight of the Empire's future shall rest upon my shoulders. All that I do will be for the benefit of the people of FÃ³dlan.

Emperor Ionius IX: Edelgard von Hresvelg, the crown is yours. By the covenant between the red blood and the white sword, and by the double-headed eagle upon your head, I hereby pronounce you the new emperor. Are you prepared to take those responsibilities as your own?
Edelgard: In accordance with the ancient covenant, and in keeping with the Hresvelg legacy... I swear that upon this throne, I shall use my reign to lead FÃ³dlan to a new dawn and achieve peace for all.

Emperor Ionius IX: The Imperial succession is complete.  My daughter, I regret that I could not do more for you. When you were stolen away to the Kingdom, when the prime minister did those horrible things, I could only watch in horror.
Edelgard: I-- I understand, Father. In those dark times, your eyes and your fists were my salvation. Within your eyes, I saw true care. And upon your fists clenched tight with indignity, I saw the blood that dripped and fell. Even as I bled, I felt that you, too, must also be bleeding.

Duke Aegir: Your Majesty! You must not leave your sleeping chambers in your condition.  Ah, Edelgard. I did not expect to find Your Highness here.
Edelgard: Prime Minister, you have misspoken. I am no longer Your Highness but rather...Your Majesty.
Duke Aegir: I-Impossible!
Emperor Ionius IX: It is true. Edelgard is the new emperor of the Adrestian Empire. We will summon the officials,  and prepare an ordinance at once. And you, Prime Minister--
Edelgard: --are dismissed. It will be some time before you are allowed to make contact with the outside world again.
Duke Aegir: No! How can this be?! I- Understood, Your Majesty.
Emperor Ionius IX: Edelgard... My dear El, I leave the fate of FÃ³dlan...  in your capable hands.
Edelgard: Father...

Edelgard: Thank you for staying by my side, Professor. Now that I'm the emperor, it's time to grasp my destiny. After the ceremony at the Holy Tomb, I must return to Enbarr. This may be the last we see of each other. We are out of time, my teacher. Everyone is waiting for us. We must go.

Dimitri: A revelation from the goddess... To think we'll have the honor of attending such a historical event.
Dedue: I hear the archbishop will accompany us to the Holy Tomb.
Ingrid: If something happens to her, all of FÃ³dlan will suffer. We must protect her at all costs.
Dimitri: This may sound mad, but perhaps we don't have to worry so much about that. Lady Rhea has said before that she is capable of protecting herself. I have a felling that is true. I thought it was a strange thing for her to say. and beyond that, her movements bring to mind a great warrior with an extensive military background.
Byleth: Who is Rhea, really?
Byleth: If so, we have nothing to fear.
Dimitri: I wonder. Mind it's also possible that I'm way off track. Regardless, perhaps we should brace ourselves for anything.
Ashe: I never imagined attending a ceremony for real revelation.
Mercedes: I wonder what the ceremony will be like. I'm so nervous. I'm not ready for this.
Felix: There's no chance for battle unless something goes terribly wrong, right? How boring.
Sylvain: If you keep saying things like that, something bad is bound to happen.
Annette:  What's wrong, Flayn? You look like you have something on your mind.
Flayn: Who, me? No, it is nothing. May we all see this through to the end.
Dedue:  Your Highness, I will protect you no matter what.  Your Highness?
Dimitri: ...
Byleth: Lost in thought?
Byleth: You haven't seemed like yourself lately...
Dimitri: Hm? Ah, I suppose you could say that. Nothing to worry about. It's about time for Lady Rhea to arrive. Let's all steel ourselves for whatever may occur at this ceremony.

Claude: You're going to receive the goddess's revelation at the Holy Tomb? That's news to me. I did not see that coming.
Hilda: Lady Rhea's going too, right? I hear it will be well-guarded, but it is that really okay?
Ignatz: If Solon's allies are still around, it's certainly true that we don't know when or where they may appear.
Leonie: I don't know what type of place this Holy Tomb is, but we should be cautious.
Raphael: If something happens, we'll have to take matters into our own hands.
Hilda: What do you think, Professor? Is it really okay for Lady Rhea to attend?
Byleth: I'm worried.
Claude: It seems to be tightly sealed, I'll give you that. We should be fine as long as nothing goes terribly wrong. Yep... Just as long as nothing goes wrong.
Byleth: It's encouraging.
Claude: Leave it to our fearless leader to shrewdly factor in Rhea's fighting ability. You're bold, Teach. I love it.
Claude: Well, the truth is, we won't know what's going on until it happens. All we can do is stay on our guard and play it by ear.
Lorenz: That's quite enough babbling, Claude. There is nobody more unfit for a holy ceremony than you.
Marianne: Um, divine punishment won't strike us for setting foot in the Holy Tomb, right?
Lysithea: Good grief. Why are you always so negative?
Lysithea: Hm? Flayn, is something on your mind?
Flayn: Who, me? No, it is nothing. May we all see this through to the end.
Claude: It still doesn't make sense to me. A goddess was living inside Teach, right? But now there's a ceremony to receive a revelation or whatever. How could that be necessary anymore? There must be another objective.  It's pointless to speculate about it now. We'll know the answer soon enough. There isn't any danger for us students, but... be careful, Teach.

Rhea: Are you surprised, Professor? This is the Holy Tomb.
Edelgard: To think there was such a vast space beneath the monastery all this time. It's hard imagine that any of these enormous contraptions are of this world. 
Rhea: This is where the goddess who created this world was laid to rest, along with her children.
Rhea: It is said that our creator, the goddess Sothis, sat upon this very throne. Professor, do you recognize this throne?
Byleth: I do. 
Rhea: So long... I have waited so very long for this day. Sit upon the throne. I have no doubt you will be gifted a revelation from the goddess.
Byleth: I do not. 
Rhea: There is no need to hide anything from me. You have seen it, havenât you? In a dream...
Rhea: Well?  It was supposed to be but a step away. What could possibly be missing?
Edelgard:  Stop right there.
Metodey:  Don't move, any of you. If you move, your lives will be forfeit. Thank you ever so much for guiding us this far. The Imperial army will now take possession of everything in the Holy Tomb. 
Dorothea: What's the Imperial army doing here?
Ferdinand: Wait! Does he work for the Flame Emperor?
Linhardt: So the Flame Emperor's connected to the Empire. I never thought that possible.
Bernadetta: Edelgard, did you know about this?
Edelgard: Yes. In fact, I gave the order. I am the Flame Emperor.
Hubert: I guess that's the end of play-at-school, Lady Edelgard. I mean, Your Majesty.
Metodey: Get to work, everyone! The Crest Stones belong to us now! And take those filthy bones, too.
Rhea: Insolence! You will atone for the sin of tramping on this holy resting place.  Professor, destroy these villainous traitors who dare dishonor our creator!
Caspar: Wait! What's the meaning of this, Edelgard?
Petra:  You... made use of us? Why?
Edelgard: I'm sorry, my teacher. I cut this path, and now I must follow it. My friends, I ask that all of you stay back. It is not my intention to fight you.  By order of the Adrestian emperor, Edelgard von Hresvelg, I command you to collect the Crest Stones! If anyone attempts to stop us, kill them!

Rhea: Are you surprised, Professor? This is the Holy Tomb.
Dimitri: Incredible. To think such a vast space has been hiding beneath the monastery all this time. I wonder what powers that giant mechanism that descends beneath the ground.
Rhea: This is where the goddess who created this world was laid to rest, along with her children.
Rhea: It is said that our creator, the goddess Sothis, sat upon this very throne. Professor, do you recognize this throne?
Byleth: I do. 
Rhea: So long... I have waited so very long for this day. Sit upon the throne. I have no doubt you will be gifted a revelation from the goddess.

Dimitri: Halt! Reveal yourself!
Metodey:  Don't move, any of you. If you move, your lives will be forfeit. Thank you ever so much for guiding us this far. The Imperial army will now take possession of everything in the Holy Tomb. 
Dedue: Why is the Imperial Army here?
Ingrid: This can't be. How did they get into Garreg Mach?
Sylvain: Even the Flame Emperor is here. That can only mean--
Felix: The Flame Emperor is connected to the Empire. What do you know.
Dimitri: I never imagined you'd have the nerve to return here. What are you after, Flame Emperor?
Flame Emperor: Is it not obvious? The Holy Tomb contains great power; the power to rule all of FÃ³dlan.
Dimitri: And to attain that power, you'll trample anything that stands in your way, just like you did in Duscur!
Flame Emperor: I had nothing to do with that.  Quickly, retrieve the Crest Stones! Kill for them if you must.
Rhea: Insolence! You will atone for the sin of tramping on this holy resting place.  Professor, destroy these villainous traitors who dare dishonor our creator!

Rhea: Are you surprised, Professor? This is the Holy Tomb.
Claude: That mechanism for descending underground back there... What powers it? When I tried to come by myself, it wouldn't even budge.
Rhea: This is where the goddess who created this world was laid to rest, along with her children.
Rhea: It is said that our creator, the goddess Sothis, sat upon this very throne. Professor, do you recognize this throne?
Byleth: I do.

Metodey:  Don't move, any of you. If you move, your lives will be forfeit. Thank you ever so much for guiding us this far. The Imperial army will now take possession of everything in the Holy Tomb. 
Ignatz: The Imperial Army? What are they doing here?
Lysithea: So, they knew we were heading to the Holy Tomb and followed us here.
Hilda: Hey, who is that standing next to the angry guy? Could that be--
Claude: The Flame Emperor. I see. So you've been allied with the Empire from the beginning.
Leonie: What are they doing here? What do they hope to gain?
Claude: There's only one goal for grave robbers like these, right, Flame Emperor? You're here to steal the treasure that rests within the Holy Tomb.
Flame Emperor: For a fool, you catch on quickly. Those Crest Stones will be ours. That infernal power, which is masquerading as a medicine but is truly a poison, will plague this world no longer.
Rhea: Insolence! You will atone for the sin of tramping on this holy resting place.  Professor, destroy these villainous traitors who dare dishonor our creator!

@Opening 
Your house ventures into the Holy Tomb to receive a revelation from the goddess. In that hidden place, deep beneath Garreg Mach, a shocking truth is revealed.

@Battle 
Rhea: I will not allow such violence from the Empire! Strike down the rebels and protect the Holy Tomb!
Metodey: The Crest Stones are in the caskets! Open every last one of them!
Rhea: The Holy Tomb must not be desecrated! Protect as many of the Crest Stones as you can!

Dimitri: Heretics! What could be gained from desecrating these tombs and disgracing the dead?!

Claude: I guess we're fighting over who gets those Crest Stones... What in the world do they intend to use them for, anyway?

Edelgard: Take away every last one of those Crest Stones.
Rhea: That is enough! Do you even know what those stones are?!

Flame Emperor: Take away the Crest Stones. All of them!
Rhea: That is enough! Do you even know what those stones are?!

@Boss 
Metodey: I'm told it's fine to kill those who resist. Now then, how shall I cook you?

Metodey: Wait... No! I was just following orders! I just... Graaargh!

Edelgard: Despite what I said, I have no intention of killing you. So why not stand down and get out of my way?

Edelgard: So the end has come...

%Byleth,Edelgard
Edelgard: Professor, I will make no excuses. Thank you for all that you did for me. In truth-- No. Let's leave it at that.

Flame Emperor: You wish to interfere? Then your life is forfeit.

%Byleth,Flame Emperor
Flame Emperor: You are the one person I did not wish to make an enemy of...

%Dimitri,Flame Emperor
Dimitri: Do not try to say you have forgotten... Do you know just how many people died in Duscur?
Flame Emperor: Why bother with this? Stay silent and fight.
Dimitri: So you want to turn your eyes away from the lives you have trampled? Dastard! You are a monster. The lowliest beast I have ever known.

%Claude,Flame Emperor
Claude: So, you're the fabled Flame Emperor? Go ahead and enlighten me. What are you planning to do with the Crest Stones? What did you use Flayn's blood for? Who's Kronya? Who's Solon?
Flame Emperor: Silence. There is no need for you to know.
Claude: Is it that mask that's to blame for your curtness? If so, maybe I should rip it off and ask again.

@End 
Flame Emperor: Ugh...
Dimitri: ... 

Edelgard: So the end has come...
Claude: Is this some sick joke? The Flame Emperor is actually Edelgard?!

Edelgard: ...
Dimitri: Before I break your neck, there is one thing I must ask you.
Edelgard: Stay out of my way.
Dimitri: I don't recall giving you permission to speak. Answer my question. That is all you have left to do. Flame Emperor...no. Edelgard. Tell me now. Why did you cause such a tragedy?
Edelgard: ...
Dimitri: You killed your own mother, and yet you haven't even had the decency to stop and consider the reasons behind your actions. Have you?!
Edelgard: I already told you, I had nothing to do with that.
Dimitri: Ha! It was foolish to think I could reason with a lowly beast.
Imperial Soldier: Your Majesty, now!
Dimitri: You are a monster...
Edelgard: Come, Hubert!
Rhea: To flee is futile, wicked girl. The Church of Seiros will raise its entire army against you, until you have been captured and punished! You have defiled the Holy Tomb, dishonored the goddess, and humiliated your brethren. That crime will never be erased, even if you burn in the eternal flames, and spill all of your blood into the goddess's soil!
Rhea: Come, Professor. Let us return and decide upon our next course of action.
Dimitri: Ngah...
Byleth: Are you OK?
Byleth: I can't believe it. Edelgard...
Dimitri: We weren't able to defeat her.
Dedue: Your Highness...
Dimitri: I will kill Edelgard. With my own hands. I swear it!  Let's return to the monastery, Professor. It is clear what must be done.
Rhea: You have disappointed me, Edelgard. To think that a descendant of House Hresvelg would dare betray the holy church...  Professor, kill Edelgard at once. She is a danger to all of FÃ³dlan. Such a rebellious heart cannot be allowed to keep beating.
Edelgard: I have achieved my objective. I will retreat. Farewell, Professor. If we meet again, it will be on the battlefield.
Edelgard: Come, Hubert!
Rhea: To flee is futile, wicked girl. The Church of Seiros will raise its entire army against you, until you have been captured and punished! You have defiled the Holy Tomb, dishonored the goddess, and humiliated your brethren. That crime will never be erased, even if you burn in the eternal flames, and spill all of your blood into the goddess's soil!

Rhea: Come, Professor. Let us return and decide upon our next course of action.
Claude: I'm not exactly on friendly terms with the princess, but I do have a few questions for her. Edelgard said that the Crest Stones represent power. That means she knows how to use them. She almost certainly knows other secrets of FÃ³dlan as well... Once things calm down a bit, there's a lot more that Rhea needs to tell us.
Claude: I just hope there's still time. I have this strange feeling... that history is being written. That an age of anarchy is upon us. Let's hope I'm mistaken.

Rhea: You have disappointed me, Edelgard. To think that a descendant of House Hresvelg would dare betray the holy church...
Edelgard: So, it is my teacher who stands in my way. I always knew it would come to this...
Rhea: Professor, kill Edelgard at once. She is a danger to all of FÃ³dlan. Such a rebellious heart cannot be allowed to keep beating.

Rhea: Come, Professor. Let us return and decide upon our next course of action.

Rhea: You... How dare you!
Edelgard:  My teacher, I-- Thank you! But are you certain that-- No, now isn't the time for discussion.
Hubert: Words cannot properly express my gratitude, Professor.
Rhea: So, this is the choice you have made. You are just another failure. Your presence soils this Holy Tomb, and disgraces my brethren. I will not allow one who would lend our enemies strength... to wield the power of the goddess Sothis. I have passed judgement. And now, I shall rip your chest open... and TAKE BACK YOUR HEART MYSELF!
Hubert:  That must be the Immaculate One...
Edelgard: Yes. The monsters that have controlled FÃ³dlan in secret for far too long. Rhea is their leader.
Hubert: There is no time to waste. Your Majesty, Professor, we must escape while we can.

@End 
Seteth: Edelgard and Hubert have disappeared. They will surely return to the Empire. The knights have been dispatched to search and investigate. If there is any movement, we will know. We cannot ignore the possibility that there will soon be open hostilities between us and the Imperial army. When that happens, are you prepared to fight your own? If you wish to return to the Empire, I will not stop you. That is your choice to make.
Ferdinand: If Edelgard is acting afoul, then we have no choice but to strike her down.
Caspar: It's up to us to stop them! We have a war on our hands!
Linhardt: I have no interest in fighting, not even for her. And yet--
Bernadetta: How are we supposed to decide just like that?
Dorothea: Edie, Hubie, I'm sorry about this, but... I'm siding with the professor.
Petra: Her doings are wrong. It is our duty to make everything right.
Seteth: I am sure you all have much on your mind. I encourage you to confer with your professor and make a decision. You have until the fighting commences.  Professor, I am depending on your strength for the safety of FÃ³dlan.

Edelgard: The leaders of the church have misused its creed to fulfill their true desire - to rule the world. They have fooled the people of FÃ³dlan. Long ago, they divided the Empire to create a Kingdom, and then, divided that Kingdom to create an Alliance. They did all of this to make the masses bicker amongst themselves. They caused instability in order to reinforce their own authority. They gathered gold and lived in extravagance. How? By preying on the devotion of those who wished for the goddess's salvation! Those corrupt hypocrites cannot lead FÃ³dlan to true peace! Their foul belief system must be torn asunder so that true wisdom may finally prevail! And so, I have decided-- by order of the Adrestian Emperor, Edelgard von Hresvelg-- the Empire hereby declares war on the Church of Seiros!

Seteth: I cannot believe it... Let us recount the situation as it stands, Professor. After you returned from the Holy Tomb... the Adrestian Empire declared war upon the Church of Seiros, as well as our allies.
Byleth: Declared war?
Seteth: Edelgard demanded her own father relinquish the throne, and then assumed the position of emperor. She has deemed the Church of Seiros to be an evil of this world, and is calling upon the people of FÃ³dlan to help her tear it down. I must discuss our response to this declaration with the archbishop after the knights return from their investigation. Until then, watch over the students. See that they remain calm.

Felix: So... He's finally shown his true face. The same Dimitri I've seen once beforeâa beast who loves spilling blood.
Ingrid: You're wrong! I'm sure of it. There has to be an explanation...
Sylvain: I knew he'd been carrying the burden of that tragedy. I understand his thirst for revenge. His family and closest friends...all massacred right in front of him. But...it still doesn't add up. There must be more that we don't know.
Mercedes: That's true. Dimitri didn't come unhinged until after the Flame Emperor was unmasked...
Ashe: You don't think...there's some connection between those two...do you?

Dedue: Professor. The Empire has declared war on the Church of Seiros.
Sylvain: We knew this day would come, sooner or later.
Annette: What's going to happen?!
Byleth: Don't worry.
Byleth: We need more information.
Ingrid: We can't afford to be optimistic. It's entirely possible the Kingdom will be invaded.
Sylvain: Settle yourself, Ingrid. We need to carefully consider our options.
Ashe: We can't just act rashly. That will only make things worse.
Dedue: One we've ascertained the situation, we must return to Fhirdiad.  Your Highness...
Dimitri: ... 

Claude: I heard what happened, Teach. The princess-- well, the emperor now-- she really did it, didn't she? The lords and dukes of both the Kingdom and the Alliance have been called out, and now have to choose between the Church and the Empire. The seed of conflict was always there, and now we find ourselves in the middle of a war that will tear FÃ³dlan in two.
Lysithea: The Empire is rash, but I never thought it would come to this.
Leonie: How could something like this happen? I hope everyone back home is safe.
Hilda: I'm sure it's mass confusion at home right now. My brother must be worried sick about me.
Byleth: Only time will tell.
Byleth: Let's calm down.
Claude: You're absolutely right, Teach. I'm sure a lot of us are worried about our homes, but... all we can do now is prepare for battle... and tread carefully.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Hoarfroast now graces treetops and open fields alike, and an icy chill blown in from the north of Faerghus blankets the land. All of FÃ³dlan's creatures begin to settle in for a long winter. The setting sun bathes the full winter coat of every wolf in a foreboding scarlet glow. Hunters can now spread the word that the red wolves are back on the prowl.

@Dialogue 
Shamir: That's what we're dealing with. Is there no chance it's an infectious disease?
Manuela: There are no absolutes in medicine, but the chances are extremely slim. Restless movements, fits of violence, becoming bedridden or even impossible to wake... With symptoms that varied, there are only a few possibilities. It's either a mixture of poisons or magic. And dark magic, at that.

Jeralt: You're talking about Remire Village, aren't you, Manuela?
Manuela: Oh my, if it isn't Jeralt. Tell me, what was the first thing you heard?
Jeralt: Everything after you mentioned that it's not likely it's an infectious disease. My child and I owe the people of Remire Village. If something's happening there, we must help them.
Shamir: We scouted the area ourselves. Speak with the knights. Hear what they have to say. I must go. Thank you for your help, Manuela.

Manuela: You know, I'm more than willing to go with you to Remire Village... After all, I owe you my life. If you'd like, I bet we could even manage the mission all by ourselves. Just the two of us...
Byleth: That's nice of you. 
Manuela: Professor! A bit of a tease, are we? A girl could get used to this side of you.
Byleth: I'm afraid not. 
Manuela: You're saying no? Well, aren't you just a great, big bore.
Jeralt: Nice try, but I'll be going to the village as well. Enough nonsense. It's time to move out.
Manuela: As you like. Good-bye, Jeralt. Good-bye, Professor.

Jeralt: I'll be in my office making preparations. What about you? If you have the time, it would be helpful if you could go ahead and talk to the knights.
Byleth: ... 
Jeralt: Hey! What's wrong?
Byleth: I'm OK.
Byleth: I just got a little dizzy. 
Jeralt: If anything feels off, return to the infirmary. No need to just grin and bear it. Got it?

Sothis: Ugh... What could have caused such dizziness? I felt it too. Actually... I've felt that way before...

@Dialogue 
^start 
Hubert: You look unwell. It's because of what happened, isn't it?
Edelgard: Don't speak of it aloud.
Hubert: You can't change the past. For now, all we can do is use it to our advantage.
Edelgard: I know that. I also know that I must steel myself to ascend the Imperial throne.
Hubert: Those preparations are going well. We... Someone is coming.
Edelgard: Professor, I heard about our mission for this month. Something terrible is happening in Remire Village. That's where you were when fate sent you our way. This feels...preordained.
Hubert: Are the knights making progress with their investigation?
Byleth: I don't know.
Byleth: They are. 
Hubert: If what is happening there is by design, there must be someone pulling the strings. There is the Death Knight, of course. And the mysterious mages who were implicated with the Western Church. They showed up when Flayn was kidnapped as well. And now there is another strange occurrence near the monastery... It seems an unknown organization hopes to make the monastery its stage for something.
Edelgard: Do you believe that all of these incidents are connected, Professor?
Byleth: I do. 
Edelgard: That is the logical conclusion, but I'm not so sure.
Byleth: I do not. 
Edelgard: Oh? I'm surprised to hear you say that, but actually, I agree.
Edelgard: It certainly appears that all of the events surrounding the monastery are connected by a single thread. However... I think it's possible that it may just be a result of different motives overlapping. Remember, Professor... If you think of people as simply enemies or allies, it may be impossible to grasp the truth.

Dimitri: I see. So you'll be staying here for some time, then. Honestly, I'm surprised. I've heard it's been a few years since you last donated to the church.
Lord Arundel: That was merely because of the financial situation of my territory. I assure you, it has nothing to do with my dedication to the church. By the way, Dimitri... Isn't Edelgard currently enrolled at the Officers Academy as well?
Dimitri: Yes. She's in the Black Eagle House. I don't believe she has any plans to leave anytime soon. Why not pay her a visit?
Lord Arundel: I may do just that. It's nice to stay in touch with my dear niece every now and then. Of course I'm also delighted that I was able to speak with my nephew, as well. Whether through marriage or otherwise, family is family, after all.
Dimitri: Of course. The feeling is mutual.
Dimitri: Professor... If you were watching, you should have made your presence known.
Byleth: Who was that?
Dimitri: That was Lord Arundel, the Regent for the Empire. He is also Edelgard's uncle.
Byleth: An acquaintance of yours?
Byleth: He called you his nephew...
Dimitri: My stepmother was his younger sister. We are not related by blood, but he is technically my uncle.
Byleth: In other words...
Byleth: So, you and Edelgard... 
Dimitri: Yes. My stepmother was Edelgard's birth mother. Edelgard and I are siblings by marriage. We can delve into that topic another time. For now, let's make preparations to investigate what's happening in that village.
Sothis: Oh dear. The princess of the Empire and the Kingdom's prince are kin! How very odd.
Byleth: So that's why he was worried about her... 
Sothis: All beings are attached somehow to those who are their family. Yes...even I. I must have had a family too... I wish I could remember them. My family... I wonder who and where they are, and what they're doing now.
Byleth: I find it odd as well...
Sothis: They likely harbor knowledge they do not wish to share. Oh yes, I'm sure of it. But I suppose we must wait until the time of truth arrives...
Sothis: In any case... About this Arundel. You've heard that name before, correct?
Byleth: In the library. 
Sothis: Quite true! We came across that name within the library, right where the prince had been.
Byleth: In the office. 
Sothis: Your memory is worse than mine! The library! We came across that name within the library, right where the prince had been. Don't you recall?
Sothis: I thought that Arundel had died... And yet, not so. He seems alive and well. I wonder what the prince had hoped to learn from reading of his uncle's charity... So many things the prince has yet to tell... How bothersome...

Claude: Tomas doesn't seem to be here... Oh well, that's fine. I've been researching the Heroes' Relics a lot since we last spoke to him. I found out something interesting.
Byleth: Why have you been researching them?
Claude: Why? Do you have to ask? Trust me, what really matters is what I found out.
Byleth: Something interesting? 
Claude: It's about the connection between Crests and the Heroes' Relics. The Crest Stone of each Relic is carved with a specific Crest-the one that has the ability to wield it properly. The Crests are the keys. You need the right one to safely use a Hero's Relic. The only thing I can't figure out is...why doesn't the Sword of the Creator have a Crest Stone bearing a Crest?
Byleth: It's by the whim of the goddess. 
Claude: Hey, now! No need to write off my findings by saying it's a mere whim of the goddess.
Byleth: It had one in the past. 
Claude: Precisely. At least, that's my current guess.
Claude: There's more. I believe the Crest Stones might be the source of the Relics' inhuman power. When Miklan transformed into a Black Beast, he was taken over by something that originated from the Crest Stone. And the Crest Stone was on his body. It all seems to add up. Now, look at this picture I found in the library.
Claude: That creature is called the Immaculate One, who was supposedly sent by the goddess to save the followers of Seiros. See the pattern on its brow, and the faint circular boundary? Isn't it possible that's a Crest Stone? If all this is true, then Crest Stones are what power the ability to assume massive forms like that of the Immaculate One. And maybe the Heroes' Relics can harness that transformative power...
Seteth: Oh. It is you. Have you seen Tomas recently?
Claude: No such luck. I was hoping to speak with him myself, but he seems to be out on the town.
Seteth: I see. Well... Hm?! Where did you find that picture?
Claude: It was in the library. Why do you ask? Is it something my youthful eyes shouldn't be seeing?
Seteth: No, of course not. However, that is not part of this library's collection. It must belong to Tomas. It would be problematic if it got mixed in with the other books. I will take possession of it for now.
Claude:  Take it away where no one can see it, you mean...
Seteth: What was that?
Claude: That's what Tomas said. He said records that the monastery doesn't approve of tend to disappear.
Seteth: Tomas said that? Preposterous. I have far too much to accomplish to waste time with this foolishness.
Claude: He was certainly in a hurry. I wonder if he's off to confront Tomas. Well, he took the picture, so I guess that's that for now. I'll see you later, Teach.
Claude: So, the church is hiding something after all. Some massive secret about Relics and Crests. A secret that must have something to do with the professor's true identity...
^end

@Conversation 
Sothis: I do not know why it is so, but being here makes me feel quite...unwell. I am so sleepy...and a bit... It is a struggle merely to stay conscious... Are you feeling the same?
Byleth: I am. 
Sothis: And yet, it feels familiar... As though pulled from a corner of my memory, from a time long ago... I simply cannot fathom it.
Byleth: I am not.
Sothis: Why must you be so difficult! I know the entire contents of your heart and soul, so you should know there is no fooling me!




Edelgard: They say that things rarely if ever go according to plan. Still, plan we must. After all, if we don't effectively force things to go our way, nothing will be achieved. How about you, Professor? Are you leading the life you envisioned for yourself?
Byleth: I am. 
Edelgard: Your character must be stronger than most.
Byleth: I am not.
Edelgard: That's surprising... but I suppose it's possible you're telling the truth.

Edelgard: They say that things rarely if ever go according to plan. Still, plan we must. After all, if we don't effectively force things to go our way, nothing will be achieved. How about you, Professor? Are you leading the life you envisioned for yourself?




Dimitri: I'm sorry to ask this of you...but I would deeply appreciate it if you would promise to keep my association with Edelgard to yourself. It is a...complicated history, what she and I share.

Dimitri: Professor, you seem unwell. How are you faring? If you're not feeling well, I'd strongly recommend some rest.




Claude: Even if I spend all my time rummaging through this library, there's a limit to the knowledge that can be gained. Apparently, it only contains books whose contents have been deemed appropriate by the church. If only Tomas were around. I bet he has some interesting stories he could regale us with...



Claude: What in the world is happening in Remire Village? I hear even the knights have been dispatched. I hope it's nothing too serious... After all, that's where we first met. I have valued memories of that place.

Hubert: Need something, Professor? I was just asking Monica here to be less demanding of Lady Edelgard's time.
Monica: Hey, it's not like I'm bothering her! Sorry for the ruckus, Professor. Please don't worry about it too much. Nooothing to worry about here!
Hubert: Ugh. I wish you would worry about it a little more.

Ferdinand: Remire Village... Is that not where you met Edelgard? If you had not been there, something terrible could have happened. Did one of the house leaders know that mercenaries were staying in Remire Village? I wonder... It will remain a mystery for now. All we can do at this point is speculate.




Linhardt: I fear I may become a social recluse soon... My life consists of wearing a groove in the floor between the library and the dining hall. Although, I guess a real recluse wouldn't leave their room, eh? That would be me if you weren't my teacher, locked away in my room, reading napping, never to be seen. You know I never see Bernadetta outside of class. I wonder what it is that she does in her room all day.



Linhardt: I fear I may become a social recluse soon... My life consists of wearing a groove in the floor between the library and the dining hall. Although, I guess a real recluse wouldn't leave their room, eh?



Caspar: Hey, Professor. Did you see that my father came by during the Battle of the Eagle and Lion? He left soon after, but I saw him talking to Edelgard first. I wonder what they could have to talk about.
Byleth: Your father?
Caspar: Yeah, he's pretty important in the Empire. I thought I mentioned it to you before? He's the Minister of Military Affairs.
Byleth: Empire business, perhaps?
Caspar: I guess that would make sense. He is the Minister of Military Affairs, after all.
Caspar: Still though... I could've sworn those two didn't get along.

Bernadetta: What is it? Sorry, I've, um... I've got a cold.
Byleth: Get well soon.
Bernadetta: Um. Thanks. 
Byleth: No, you don't. 
Bernadetta: How did you know? My act was perfect. Alas, 'tis no mere illness of the body, but a malign affliction of mine soul! So, um, back to bed.
Byleth: ...



Dorothea: Congratulations on winning the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. Did you get a special reward? I certainly feel like I earned a special reward. Don't you, Professor?

Byleth: No. Winning is its own reward.
Dorothea: I was afraid you might say that. I do wish you'd dote on me just a bit more...
Dorothea: Aww... Disappointing.



Petra: This is a place of mysteriousness. I have awareness of how much difference every part of the world is. In a place alike to this place, you can imagine the goddess of FÃ³dlan truly existing. At times, I miss those places in Brigid. At times... I am missing those places so painfully.




Dedue: All this month, His Highness has been going out late into the night. He will not speak of it to me. Professor, do you happen to know anything?
Byleth: As I recall... 
Dedue: Lord Arundel is here? That may well explain it.
Byleth: I don't know.
Dedue: I see. I am sorry to trouble you with questions.
Dedue: His Highness's headaches have been growing steadily worse. I would prefer that he retire to bed early.



Dedue: Investigating Remire village? Be on your guard.

Ingrid: You know, Professorâthe tournament fish, and the meal we indulged in after the Battle of the Eagle and Lion... Why, all of the food I've eaten in this monastery has been absolutely delectable. Every last bite of it.
Felix: Food really is the only thing you think about, huh?
Ingrid: Hardly! I think about all sorts of things.
Felix: Oh! Like tomorrow's menu, for instance?

Ashe: I'm worried about Remire. That affliction is a little too mysterious for my liking. I'm pretty sure it's not normal.
Byleth: I've heard it's not an ordinary disease. 
Ashe: Then what could it be?
Byleth: I've heard it's the work of a cursed specter.
Ashe: Wh-what?! Ah! Come on, don't tease me. But what if it really was something like that? How could we hope to stop it?



Sylvain: I wonder how Remire Village is faring. Hopefully we're not dealing with some new epidemic. It wouldn't be unheard of. Almost 20 years ago, a terrible plague blazed through Faerghus. It even hit the capital city, taking the queen consort's life...or so I heard. The whole Kingdom was in an uproar over that loss. The person who saved the Kingdom wasn't a doctor but a holy womanâthe fair Lady Cornelia. After that, she was awarded the honor of being a mage in the service of the royal family. She sounds like an amazing woman, but... She must be pretty old by now. But hey, maybe she's aged like a fine wine.



Mercedes: Oh, goodness. Is something the matter, Professor? You look a little pale... Please be careful. It's so easy to catch a cold this time of year.



Annette: Hmm... The librarian is always out and about these days. And just when I had some questions about a book I'd borrowed... Ugh, now I'm so curious about where he's gone off to! He'd better come back soon...



Lorenz: How are you feeling, Professor? You look rather ill, if you don't mind my saying so. Are you sick? If so, I would urge you not to push yourself too hard. Take some rest.
Byleth: Nothing gets by you. 
Lorenz: Just my natural talent. Nothing out of the ordinary. Enough wit, now. You should lie down.
Byleth: What an unexpected kindness.
Lorenz: What is that supposed to mean? Never mind. If you're not feeling well, you should stop trying to walk it off and simply lie down.



Raphael: Hey, Professor. Can I get your advice on something? I just don't know what to do anymore. I used to think they were the best, but now I can't even stand looking at them!
Byleth: It's OK to be worried.
Raphael: But worrying about it won't solve my problems! What if I can never eat fish again?
Byleth: Time heals all wounds. 
Raphael: Good point, Professor. I think I need to see other meats right now. Then I can come back to fish when I'm good and ready!

Ignatz: Ah, Professor! The Battle of the Eagle and Lion was such good fun, don't you think?
Hilda: Ignatz, how long are you going to keep harping on about the Battle of the Eagle and Lion?
Ignatz: Aw, come on, let me gush! Did you see how the house leaders came together after the battle? What an incredible thing to witness! Harmony, even after something so hard-fought.
Hilda: True. If they can keep playing nice, perhaps there will be peace in FÃ³dlan after all.

Lysithea: I heard about Remire Village from some of the knights. It's certainly troubling. If it's a contagion, we at Garreg Mach should be on the lookout as well.
Byleth: I don't believe it is.
Lysithea: Oh? Well, that's better, but I wonder what the real cause could be... Your words are oddly persuasive, Professor. Even if they're not exactly based on anything.
Byleth: I'll handle it. 
Lysithea: Your words are oddly persuasive, Professor. Even if they're not exactly based on anything.



Marianne: Good day, Professor. Well then, I should go.

Leonie: Professor! Captain Jeralt just told me. Remire Village is in a bad way, right?
Jeralt: The situation there is worrying, yes... But tell me, how is your vertigo?
Byleth: I'm all right now.
Leonie: Were you not feeling OK? You seem fine to me.
Jeralt: I hope you're not just saying that. We can't have you putting on a brave face only to fall in battle.
Byleth: Still a little unsteady. 
Leonie: Are you not feeling OK? You should get some rest!
Jeralt: Hm. If you must go to the village, make sure you're in good health before we depart.



Rhea: Professor... Do you ever wish you could return to your life as a mercenary?
Byleth: I do.
Rhea: I thought you might. Traveling the world, just you and Jeralt... How lovely it must have been.
Byleth: I do not. 
Rhea: Is that so? I suppose you have become accustomed to your new line of work. This month's assignment will again take you outside of Garreg Mach...to Remire Village.
Rhea: It was in Remire that you first met Alois and the rest of his order, was it not? Half a year has come and gone since then. How quickly time passes...



Seteth: What is it? I am in the middle of my daily duties. I assume you know by now that the Four Saints are all important figures in the teachings of Seiros... Still, I have a particular fondness for Saint Cethleann.



Flayn: I am so happy to be part of your class, Professor. I honestly cannot recall the last time I interacted with others on a daily basis like this... It reminds me of when I was a child. Ha, that was so very long ago now...
Byleth: How long ago? 
Flayn: Oh, I mean, very. Very, very, very long ago.
Byleth: You're still a child.
Flayn: Despite how young I may appear to you, I'm quite mature. You may be surprised, you know.



Alois: I'm going to catch me some mighty fish, just you wait and see! I didn't catch a single fish last month. But this month! This month!
Byleth: Time to give up. 
Alois: That's exactly what Captain Jeralt said!
Byleth: Maybe you're doing something wrong?
Alois: I'm casting my line just as the captain taught me all those years ago...
Alois: You're going with the captain to investigate Remire Village, aren't you? It feels like so long ago that you two came here...

Catherine: Of the four or five years since I started here, this is certainly the busiest.
Shamir: It was four. I've been here five.
Catherine: Oh, what's a year here or there? Don' t be petty now, Shamir.
Shamir: You count your enemies the same way.
Catherine: If I take care of them quickly, what does it matter how many there are? Oh, sorry! We didn't mean to ignore you, Professor.
Shamir: As you were saying, it's been a busy year. There never seem to be enough hands for the work.
Catherine: That reminds me, do you have that thing? If you do, we want it.
Shamir: Want? No. We need it. Give it to me, not her.
Catherine: Hey now, I'm the one who brought it up. We may be friends, but that's just rude.





Gilbert: Professor? Tell me, is this about Remire? There are more villagers acting strangely today than yesterday. Knights have been dispatched, yet... The underlying cause is as yet unclear, and the most anyone can do is stand back and watch. It is most distressing. Professor, what do you think about all this?
Byleth: Some kind of illness.
Gilbert: If it were indeed a disease, why would it only affect the villagers, and not infect the knights stationed there?
Byleth: Some kind of conspiracy.
Gilbert: In that case, we should strengthen the guards. If you visit the village, Professor, please...take care.
Byleth: Punishment from the goddess. 
Gilbert: The goddess?! You have spoken near blasphemy, and I would suggest a hasty apology!



Hanneman: I thought we might make it through last month in peace, but no. Another incident just had to arise, didn't it? If only this debacle had to do with Crests. Why, I'd have gone and dealt with it in an instant.



Manuela: I know you figure medicine and magical healing are two ways to do the same thing, but it's way deeper than that. Medicine is all about preventing infection and suppressing symptoms with, well, medicine... That's probably obvious. But magical healing is focused on closing up wounds faster, raising a body's vital energy, stuff like that.



Cyril: The knights go out from Garreg Mach to take on all kinds of other duties. I'd sure like a job like that one day. Then again, I don't know... Serving Lady Rhea here is pretty good.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Oh, except that Tomas departed the monastery and is yet to return. Consider that reported. He's been gone for periods of time before and has always returned, so I'm not too worried. Still... I wonder what in the world he's doing out there!

@Intro 
Jeralt: We've got to go. Now.
Byleth: What's going on?
Byleth: OK.
Jeralt: The situation in Remire Village has changed drastically. We don't know much more than that. We're hearing reports that the villagers are killing each other. Some say houses are burning. Regardless, we need to move.

Rampaging Villager: Kill! Kill! Ahhhh!
Rampaging Villager: Haha... Hahaha... Hrngyarhh!
Village Child: Help! Somebody, please help!
Jeralt: What's going on here...

^start
Edelgard: This is horrific. It's even more revolting...more terrible than I expected.
Byleth: I'm revolted too. 
Byleth: It really is horrifying.
Hubert: True, but if we are not careful how we proceed, we will only increase the death toll.
Caspar: The villagers are all attacking each other! Let's knock them all out, one by one!
Linhardt:  Always so reckless. You do know that if we mess up, we will either kill or be killed, right?
Ferdinand: Still, we cannot just stand here twiddling our thumbs and doing nothing!
Bernadetta: I'd r-really like to go home now...but there's no time for thoughts like that.
Dorothea: We have to help them!
Petra: I am waiting for your orders with full readiness.
Edelgard: Wait. Those people over there... They seem to be observing the chaos. They must be behind this. Eliminate them and rescue all of the unafflicted villagers.

Dimitri:  Ungh...
Byleth: What's wrong with you?
Byleth: Are you OK? 
Dimitri: I... Don't worry about me. I'm fine.
Dimitri: Don't waste your time on me. Saving the village is far more important. We haven't a moment to lose!
Dedue: What can we do amidst such confusion?
Felix: We'll have to take up arms against the villagers who are rampaging. If we strike carefully, it should be possible to spare their lives.
Mercedes: Oh dear... Isn't there a more peaceful way to deal with this?
Ingrid: No matter how long it takes, we'll need to check and rescue them all, one at a time.
Ashe: Those who have gone made may be victims themselves. Is it possible to save them?
Annette: Well, saving the poor people who aren't crazy is definitely our top priority! Let's get on with it!
Sylvain: Slow down, Annette. It won't do anyone any good if we panic and get injured ourselves.
Dedue: Isn't that... Your Highness. Suspicious figures spotted in the village. They seem to be...watching the chaos.
Dimitri: Are they the ones responsible for this madness? If so...it's clear what must be done. Kill them all. Don't let a single one of them escape. Sever their limbs and crush their wicked skulls!

Claude: This is unbelievable... There's no way to tell who's lost their mind from who's mad with fear...
Hilda: If we don't act quickly, things are just going to keep getting worse!
Byleth: It's horrifying. 
Hilda: I really don't want to get involved here...but we can't leave these people on their own, right?
Byleth: What can we do?
Raphael: How about we hit them hard enough to knock them out, but not hard enough to kill them?
Ignatz: That's too reckless! But... I'll admit, I can't think of a better option.
Marianne: If some must die, just know it was by the will of the goddess...
Leonie: Stop that, Marianne! We have to save all of them. There's no way this madness is by the will of the goddess!
Lorenz: Nobles are responsible for the safety of commoners. By the honor of House Gloucester, I swear that I will save them all.
Lysithea: Claude. There are some strange-looking people here.
Claude: So you noticed too. Look. There's a suspicious group hiding amongst the villagers. Could they be the culprits? If so...
Byleth: They will not be forgiven.
Byleth: I won't let them escape.
Claude: There you have it. Our objective is clear. Take down that suspicious group and rescue the villagers.

@Opening 
A pattern of strange occurrences in Remire Village has suddenly erupted into something far more serious.

@Battle 
Jeralt: There are some suspicious looking ruffians out there, but our top priority is to rescue the villagers! Got it? I'll rein in the villagers who've turned violent. You focus on rescuing the others.

Edelgard: The one giving commands in the back... I'm certain that's Tomas, the librarian.

Dimitri: The one giving orders to the others...isn't that Tomas, the librarian?

Claude: It can't be... The one giving orders to the weird ruffians... Isn't that Tomas?


Edelgard: Tomas, what are you doing here? Dare I even ask?

Dimitri: Tomas. What are you doing here?

Claude: Tomas! What in the world are you doing here?

Tomas: I'm not Tomas. My name is Solon, the savior of all!

Solon: What's the matter? So shocked you can't even speak? You were so easily fooled by my disguise... I was hiding away in Garreg Mach to get the blood of that little girl called Flayn. With her blood, we'll be one step closer to realizing our goal.

Death Knight: I'll have a bit of fun here too...
Jeralt: That's the Death Knight! He must be an ally of Tomas...or Solon, or whoever he is.

Solon: They charge in without any plan whatsoever. Beasts, all of them... The experiment is over. Kill them!


Edelgard: Solon, what have you done?! You will not escape punishment!

Dimitri: ... I will cut you to shreds!

Claude: You monster! We could have saved them!

Rampaging Villager: Kill! Kill!


Villager: Th-thank you!

Jeralt: We've rescued as many as we can. Now it's time to capture Solon.

@Boss 
Solon: Ah, the cursed Fell Star... This will be a fine opportunity to measure your power.

Solon: You are but a savage, insignificant beast... Yet you think you can kill me?

%Edelgard,Solon
Edelgard: Tomas! No... Solon, I will stop you.
Solon: What?! If you insist on turning your blade against me, then expect no mercy.

@Boss
Death Knight: My pleasure... Do your best to kill me with that blade...

Death Knight: You are not the one I crave...

Death Knight: My blade craves their flesh... The weak will eventually die...

%Edelgard,Death Knight
Death Knight: What are you trying to do here?
Edelgard: You're the one who should be answering that question. Stay out of my way!

@Battle 
Edelgard: The Death Knight was just a distraction. Let's concentrate on killing Solon.

Dimitri: We let him get away... That doesn't matter now. Our top priority is to kill Solon!

Claude: What does he want, anyway? In any case, we need to take care of Solon!

@End 
Jeralt: Why have you gone after this village? What are you planning?
Solon: Heh, I could have conducted this experiment on any test subjects. Now that I have what I came for, I must bid you farewell.

Jeralt: Wait! Damn it, he's gone...

Edelgard: We let him get away... I'll survey the village. There may still be enemies in hiding.

Dimitri: I...will survey the village. There may still be some survivors.

Claude: It's over... All we can do now is focus on our next move. I'll have a look around the village. There may still be people who need our help.

Jeralt: It looks like we somehow managed to sort things out. And casualties were...kept to a minimum. They said they weren't picky about who they used as their "test subjects." Because of them, the people of Remire Village...
Flame Emperor: There you are.

Jeralt: That armor. So, you're the Flame Emperor.
Flame Emperor: Yes. I believe you have met my subordinate, the Death Knight.
Jeralt: Oh, we've met him all right. But back to you. You're the one responsible for the destruction of this village.
Flame Emperor: Do not get the wrong idea.
Jeralt: What in blazes does that mean?
Flame Emperor: It is true that I am working with Solon. But that does not mean our objectives are the same. Had I known they planned to do this, I would have stopped it. You have my word.
Jeralt: Your words are meaningless. Now, I'll have to insist you accompany us back to the monastery.
Flame Emperor: I cannot abide that. However, if you wish to join forces, I will hear your plea.
Jeralt: What?!
Flame Emperor: If left to their own devices, they will commit countless more violent acts like this one. Do you not wish to prevent that? With the Sword of the Creator on our side, Solon would not be a threat...
Byleth: I will join your cause.
Flame Emperor: You are lying. I can see that you cannot contain your fury toward me. Pity.
Byleth: I must refuse.
Flame Emperor: Pity. Though not unexpected.
Flame Emperor: Pray that you do not live to regret your choice.

Hubert: Jeralt, Professor! Have you seen Lady Edelgard?!

Dedue: Jeralt. Professor. Have you seen His Highness?

Hilda: Jeralt! Professor! Have you seen Claude?

Jeralt: What's wrong, kid? Huh? Damn it! He's gone...

Jeralt: Hey. I've been meaning to talk to you. Since coming to the monastery...you've changed.
Byleth: Changed?
Byleth: How so?
Jeralt: You've been angry since we first arrived in Remire Village. And you look so happy when you're instructing the brats. Before the monastery, I'd never seen you bear your emotions like that. Not once.
Byleth: You might be right.
Byleth: It's thanks to the students.
Jeralt: Then perhaps it's a good thing we came to the monastery, if only so I could see your face lit up like that. Or maybe there was never any reason for us to leave the monastery in the first place...
Byleth: A reason to leave?
Byleth: Wasn't I born after you left the monastery?
Jeralt: Ah... I've put my foot in my mouth, haven't I? Though I suppose it may be nearly that time... Come to my office when you next have a moment to spare. There's something I need to tell you.

Sothis: Just what was that about? I can't recall a time of old when you were at the monastery... I wonder what is hiding in the mist that is your past...

@End 
^start
Edelgard: Professor, I don't know if this is appropriate to say, but...admirable work out there. I really believe we did all that we could.
Byleth: I wish that were true.
Edelgard: Jeralt said the same thing. We must try to stay positive, even through the horror.
Byleth: I wasn't strong enough.
Edelgard: No mortal is all powerful. We must try to stay positive, even through the horror.
Edelgard: I hear the so-called "Flame Emperor" appeared in Remire Village as well. Hubert told me that you spoke with him.
Byleth: He said he wasn't involved in this incident.
Edelgard: And do you believe him, Professor?
Byleth: I believe him.
Edelgard: Oh? But how can you trust someone without even knowing who they are?
Byleth: I don't believe him.
Edelgard: That makes sense. It's hard to trust someone without knowing who they are or how they're connected to all this.
Edelgard: Even if his words are true, his objectives are still unclear. But if the Flame Emperor should someday reveal his true intentions... Maybe then he will appear before you without his mask, and you can look in his eyes and decide what you believe.
Byleth: He asked me to join forces with him.
Edelgard: Really? Is that what you want, Professor?
Byleth: I do.
Edelgard: Oh? But how can you trust someone without even knowing who they are?
Byleth: I do not.
Edelgard: That makes sense. It's hard to trust someone without knowing who they are or how they're connected to all this.
Edelgard: Even if he wants you as an ally, his objectives are still unclear. If the Flame Emperor truly wishes to make use of your power... Perhaps someday he will appear before you without his mask, and you can look in his eyes and decide what you believe.
Monica: Edel! I need to ask you something! Oh, I'm so sorry. Did I interrupt?
Edelgard: No, not at all. If you'll excuse me, Professor.

Dimitri: Professor... I...I'm sorry you saw that side of me in the village. It must have been quite a shock to you and the others. I'm mortified by my behavior. When I saw the chaos and violence there...my mind just went completely dark.
Byleth: I felt the same. 
Dimitri: I see... So that happens to you as well, then.
Byleth: You weren't yourself.
Dimitri: I see why you would say that. I always strive to keep my emotions at bay, but... Sometimes the darkness takes hold and...it's impossible to suppress. It just shows you how lacking I am... I have much to learn.
Dimitri: I've told you before...that some day we may find ourselves facing something we simply cannot accept. That's what the chaos in Remire Village was to me. Solon and the Flame Emperor are both beasts who must be eliminated. Demons who kill the innocent. They aren't even human at this point.
Byleth: The Flame Emperor said he wasn't involved. 
Dimitri: And you believed him?! He doesn't deserve our forgiveness. He became an accomplice when he refused to turn himself in and return with us to the monastery.
Byleth: Where is this anger coming from?
Dimitri: It must be hard to fathom. It's true that I don't have any strong connection to those villagers. And yet...
Dimitri: You see, Professor... I saw the same flames of torment just four years ago...in Duscur.
@Flashback
Kingdom General: Please! Have mercy!
Kingdom Soldier: Gah, the pain! Make the burning stop! Help me... Somebody...
Lambert: Avenge us! Those who killed us... Tear them apart! Destroy them all!
@End
Dimitri: Ugh... Gah... My father...my stepmother... Four years ago, they lost their lives to those flames. I'll never forget... I still remember their faces. Their screams. The tortured last moments of every person who died that day... But right now...all that matters is that we do whatever we can to help the surviving villagers get back to their normal lives.
Dimitri: Thank you. For everything.  There's a reason that I came to the Officers Academy. Just one reason. I came here for revenge. And one day, I will have it.

Claude: Hey, Teach. That assignment wasn't my favorite, I've got to admit. I suppose pretending to be unaffected doesn't do anyone any good. That was terrible to behold. It's always hard to see innocents die.
Byleth: It is.
Byleth: I wasn't strong enough.
Claude: Hey, all you can do is keep smiling. Keep marching. That's part of a leader's job. You can't give in to despair. Not just for me or for you, but for all of us in the Golden Deer House. We have to keep smiling so the others can move forward too. As long as we don't show that we're disheartened, they'll know they can make it too. That's what matters.
Claude: Sorry for getting ahead of myself, Teach. That's how I feel, but how you handle it is really up to you. By the way... I hear that guy who calls himself the Flame Emperor showed up in Remire Village. I couldn't believe it when Hilda told me the news. What could he be after?
Byleth: The Heroes' Relics.
Claude: Maybe. After all, he was after the Sword of the Creator in the Holy Mausoleum... But then they kidnapped Flayn and used her blood for their recent attack. Based on that, we should probably assume that their true objective is something other than the Relics. Don't you think?
Byleth: You have a point.
Byleth: What do they want with Flayn's blood?
Claude: They called this incident "an experiment." And they said they got what they came for. That means they might take this success and attempt something even bigger next time. Sadly, that's all we can assume. There are far too many things we still don't know.
Byleth: World domination. 
Claude: Ha! I know I just laughed, but that really isn't funny, Teach. World domination... Hm. OK, actually... I wonder. They called this incident "an experiment." And they said they got what they came for. That means they might take this success and attempt something even bigger next time. I hate to even consider it, but if they can replicate the incident at Remire Village on an even larger scale... If we're not careful, we'll have a full-scale war on our hands. Then world domination wouldn't be a joke anymore.
Byleth: I don't know. 
Claude: I was afraid you'd say that. Frankly, there's way too much that we still don't know. They called this incident "an experiment." And they said they got what they came for. That means they might take this success and attempt something even bigger next time. Sadly, that's all we can assume.
Claude: Flayn! Your timing is impeccable. Would you care to join us for a while, fair lady?
Flayn: Wha--? Why?! Oh my!
Claude: Damn. She gave us the slip. In any case, I doubt she knows the full story. It seems more like she has something on her mind that she can't divulge.
Byleth: You're pushing too hard.
Byleth: We can't go easy on her. 
Claude: Whoa, there. Settle yourself, Teach.
Claude: Seems like it would be better to push Seteth for an explanation. Or, best of all, to go above his head and ask Rhea... Now that we know Tomas was an enemy, we can't be sure that exposing the church's secrets would be to our benefit. Where are the answers I seek? Where are they...
^end

@End 
Rhea: You did well handling that awful business in Remire Village. I am certain the goddess shares in our grief at the senselessness of that calamity. More importantly, I was shocked to hear that our own Tomas was actually a dark mage. I must reflect on our blindness.
Sothis: You surely must! You failed to notice that a rat was hiding in your home. Pathetic! Who are these wicked foes? How did Tomas escape your gaze?
Byleth: Who are these villains?
Byleth: Why did Tomas come to the monastery?
Seteth: Tomas came to the monastery 40 years ago, by recommendation of House Ordelia of the Alliance. Around eight years ago he went back to House Ordelia before returning to the monastery once again just last year. After having worked at Garreg Mach for decades, why would he betray us now? Just what did he hope to accomplish? Jeritza became a professor at the Officers Academy because of a recommendation from the Imperial nobility. Supposing that he is the Death Knight, that means that our enemy is an organization that has taken root in at least two territories.
Rhea: In the long history of the Church of Seiros... No, long before even that... There have been an endless number of threats to the peace of FÃ³dlan. Yet, those who oppose us still operate in the shadows, their identities a mystery. I believe that Solon and the Death Knight are merely one part of a much larger whole.
Sothis: A threat to FÃ³dlan's peace? That means we have no choice. We have to stop them all!
Byleth: What now?
Seteth: Without knowing what their objective is, we cannot afford to act recklessly. The knights will investigate. For now, you and your class should focus on your training.
Byleth: They must be stopped. 
Rhea: I have truly come to rely on you. I believe that the monastery will remain safe so long as we have you. We do not yet know the enemy's objective or whereabouts. For now, please devote yourself to preparing for whatever comes next.
Seteth: That is all for today.

Rhea: Professor. Please wait. I know there is much that you still do not understand. However, one thing is clear. You possess great power. I believe that you are destined to be a source of great hope for all. In any case, I expect great things from you. Walk this world proudly, dear Professor. May the goddess Sothis protect you.
Sothis: The goddess Sothis?! Is that what she just said?
Rhea: Is something the matter?
Byleth: It's nothing.
Rhea: I see. In that case, farewell.
Byleth: I had never heard the name of the goddess. 
Rhea: I see. Sothis is the goddess's true name. Please do not use it carelessly. Farewell.
Sothis: Do not say something that we may regret! She... I... What exactly am I? For now, let's leave this place. Please... Go!
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
From on high, flocks of wyverns roar in chorus and soar the pristine skies, heading south for the winter. FÃ³dlan's children lend their hands to winter preparations by gathering firewood and catching fish from the rivers' cool waters. Yet all the while their gazes are turned skyward, drawn to the magnificent sight above.

@Dialogue 
^start
Edelgard: Professor, you already know about the Battle of the Eagle and Lion, correct?
Byleth: Only the name.
Byleth: I can't recall. 
Edelgard: I see. In that case, allow me to fill you in. It's a large-scale mock battle between the rival houses that takes place every year.
Hubert: Its scale is incomparable to the mock battle we fought during the Great Tree Moon. It will take place in the vast Gronder Field. That is in Empire territory to the southeast of Garreg Mach.
Edelgard: Whichever house defeats the most opponents wins. Of course, the professors also fight alongside their respective houses.
Hubert: Well, usually. Professor Manuela is being prudent. She will not be participating this year. Since his long-time rival will be absent, Professor Hanneman has also declined.
Byleth: In that case, I must sit out too. 
Byleth: What should I do?
Manuela: Oh, don't worry about us. You know you wanna see the kids in action.
Hubert: Are you feeling any better, Professor Manuela?
Manuela: Thanks to all of you. But I'd only be a burden out there. My students don't need to see me collapsed. Well, not on the battlefield, anyway.
Hanneman: Correct, we will not be participating. Regardless, do not expect victory to come easily. Or at all.
Manuela: Well put. We've spent the past few months pushing our students to their limits. You can see me in the infirmary after they destroy you.
Byleth: If I'm the only professor present... 
Byleth: This doesn't seem fair... 
Manuela: Oh my, look at you. If you're as confident as all that, my students will walk all over you.
Hanneman: We have taught our students well. There is no need to hold back. Challenge them with everything you have!

Dimitri: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion is finally upon us! This is our chance to show off the results of your expert training, Professor.
Byleth: Battle of the Eagle and Lion?
Dimitri: Have Lady Rhea and Seteth really not filled you in? Well, if that's the case, I'm happy to explain.
Byleth: It slipped my mind. 
Dimitri: Haha, I highly doubt that. If you don't mind, I'd be happy to explain.
Dimitri: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion takes place every year during the Wyvern Moon. It can best be described as a mock battle between the three houses.
Dedue: Much like the one we had during the Great Tree Moon. Do you remember, Professor?
Byleth: Yes, I remember.
Byleth: I remember our celebration most of all. 
Dimitri: It was certainly an unforgettable time. I've never seen anyone put away as much victory food as you did that night, Professor!
Dimitri: This battle will take place in Empire territory, at Gronder Field. In other words, far removed from the monastery. It's a mock battle between the three houses. The house that defeats the most opponents wins.
Dedue: Your Highness, if the rumors are true, I believe Professor Manuela and Professor Hanneman will not be joining us.
Dimitri: Ah, yes, right you are. Given recent events, Professor Manuela has opted to sit this one out. Since she won't be present, Professor Hanneman has decided to skip this year as well.
Byleth: In that case, I must sit out too. 
Byleth: What should I do?
Manuela: Oh, don't worry about us. You know you wanna see the kids in action.
Dimitri: Professor Manuela! Are you feeling better already?
Manuela: Thanks to all of you. But I'd only be a burden out there. My students don't need to see me collapsed. Well, not on the battlefield, anyway.
Dedue: In that case, perhaps it is best that you sit this one out.
Hanneman: Correct, we will not be participating. Regardless, do not expect victory to come easily. Or at all.
Manuela: Well put. We've spent the past few months pushing our students to their limits. You can see me in the infirmary after they destroy you.
Byleth: If I'm the only professor present... 
Byleth: This doesn't seem fair... 
Manuela: Oh my, look at you. If you're as confident as all that, my students will walk all over you.
Hanneman: We have taught our students well. There is no need to hold back. Challenge them with everything you have!

Claude: It's finally time! The Battle of the Eagle and Lion at Gronder Field is this month. Don't tell me you forgot, Teach?
Byleth: It slipped my mind. 
Claude: You're kidding! Come on, Teach, I need you to keep it together for me. Don't lose focus when it counts.
Byleth: I know little about it.
Claude: You're kidding! Didn't Rhea or Seteth fill you in? Guess I have to do everything myself around here.
Claude: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion is one of the academy's annual traditions. It's a huge mock battle between the three rival houses.
Hilda: But you know all about rivalry battles, Professor. There was one right after you got here, remember? I hear the Battle of the Eagle and Lion will be held in Gronder Field, far away from Garreg Mach.
Claude: The house that defeats most opponents wins. It's a three-way battle that relies heavily on strategy. Sounds exciting, doesn't it?
Hilda: Hey Claude, what about Professor Manuela? Do you think she'll be able to join us despite her injuries?
Claude: I'm afraid she's sitting this one out, as is Professor Hanneman.  "As my persistent rival will not be present, it only goes to follow that I must also sit out this year's battle. Now leave me be, Claude!"
Byleth: In that case, I must sit out too. 
Byleth: What should I do?
Manuela: Oh, don't worry about us. You know you wanna see the kids in action.
Claude: If it isn't our own Professor Manuela! All things considered, you're looking well.
Manuela: Thanks to all of you. But I'd only be a burden out there. My students don't need to see me collapsed. Well, not on the battlefield, anyway.
Hilda: Does that mean you really won't be joining us for the battle?
Hanneman: Correct, we will not be participating. Regardless, do not expect victory to come easily. Or at all.
Manuela: Well put. We've spent the past few months pushing our students to their limits. You can see me in the infirmary after they destroy you.
Byleth: If I'm the only professor present... 
Byleth: This doesn't seem fair... 
Manuela: Oh my, look at you. If you're as confident as all that, my students will walk all over you.
Hanneman: We have taught our students well. There is no need to hold back. Challenge them with everything you have!

@Conversation 
Sothis: Hmph. This monastery is more dangerous than I expected. It's likely that our foes have infiltrated the ranks of the teachers... And there may be others of questionable character about as well! If you ask me, there is something amiss about that old man...Tomas.

Monica: What do you say, Edel? Shall we meet up in the library later to... Oh! Hello, Professor!
Edelgard: Do you need something? I'm a little busy at the moment.
Monica: Sorry, Professor! I've got a lot of questions to ask Edel here. Since I couldn't graduate last year, I really want to make sure I can do so this year. Don't worry. I won't participate in any assignments so as not to take any attention away from the younger students. I look forward to learning from you, Professor!

Monica: What do you say, Edel? Shall we meet up in the library later to... Oh! Hello, Professor!
Edelgard: Do you need something? I'm a little busy at the moment.
Monica: Sorry, Professor! I've got a lot of questions to ask Edel here. Since I couldn't graduate last year, I really want to make sure I can do so this year.




Dimitri: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion... Its name comes from the war in which the Kingdom won its independence from the Empire. It's imperative that we fight our best. We must live up to the legacy of the King of Lions.

Dimitri: To hold a fishing tournament at a time like this... Participate if you must, but I urge you not to lose sight of our goal. As for me, I won't be joining in. I'm so focused on the battle ahead, I fear I would snap my poor rod right in half.



Dimitri: Flayn and...Monica, was it? I'm glad they were returned safe and sound.




Claude: Going all the way to the Empire for a mock battle? This is serious business. And there's a reward to be had as well. I'd really like to win this thing. Everyone else seems to be raring to go too. We're all looking to you to guide us, Teach.

Claude: Going all the way to the Empire for a mock battle? This is serious business. And there's a reward to be had as well. I'd really like to win this thing.

Claude: Seteth, that stubborn goat. Holding a fishing tournament now? Just last month he looked like death warmed over.



Hubert: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion is a free-for-all contest among the three classes. If you are victorious, the archbishop will no doubt present you with a reward.
Byleth: Consider me motivated.
Byleth: I'm not interest in rewards. 
Hubert: Just what I thought you'd say.



Ferdinand: You know, the Empire used to control all of FÃ³dlan. But after the civil war, the northern region split off and became the Kingdom. Later, the eastern part of the Kingdom seceded to become the Alliance. There are three powers today, but a thousand years ago, we were all united as one. Even now, among the nobles of the Empire, there are some who dream of reunifying FÃ³dlan...



Linhardt: I'm just absolutely exhausted. I swear to you, Professor, every month we're worked harder than the month before. I had imagined the academy as a chance to possibly relax before our lives began in earnest.
Byleth: You came to the academy to relax?
Linhardt: After graduating, we'll enter into noble society, which mean contending with all the intrigues and dramas that entails. I want to just...postpone life for a bit. Fish... Nap under a tree... Skip out on lectures andâ Well, not on your lectures of course, Professor.
Byleth: It is what it is. 
Linhardt: Agreed. That's the Church of Seiros for you. What is it they say? "Those with power are obliged to use it."



Caspar: Are you gonna participate in the fishing tournament, Professor?

Bernadetta: Hi, Professor. Want to know something? Gronder is in the territory of House Bergliez, in the Empire. That's right next to my home, the region of House Varley! Oh. Oh no. What ifâ What if my parents come to watch?! Aaah!
Byleth: Calm down.
Bernadetta: I'm calm! Of course I'm calm! Why wouldn't I be calm? Ugggh!
Byleth: I don't think nobles are allowed to watch. 
Bernadetta: Really? Are you sure?! You wouldn't say that if you weren't completely sure, right?!



Dorothea: Fishing? No thanks. I tried it once, and...ugh. Gross. I don't even really like to eat fish, let alone catch and gut them. Besides, who can think about fishing right now? The Battle of the Eagle and Lion is coming up soon. Feeling confident?
Byleth: Very. 
Dorothea: That's the spirit!
Byleth: Not really. 
Dorothea: Oh, have a little faith in yourself, Professor. You'll do fine, I'm sure of it.



Petra: I fished with frequency back in Brigid. I will not have losing. Will you be trying to fish too?




Dedue: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion draws near. His Highness insists upon training well into the night. He has said it is nothing to worry about. But how could I not be concerned?

Dedue: Did you want something?

Dedue: Ever since the tournament, the kitchen is completely overtaken with fish. The cooks cannot keep up.




Felix: I'm not interested in glory or prizes. All I want is a formidable enemy to sink my teeth into. As far as I can see, there are only a couple of opponents worth my time.

Felix: Since we were little, Ingrid's always gotten this odd look in her eye when someone brings up food.



Ashe: You know, I'm pretty good at fishing. My older brother used to take me out. Why don't you give it a try too? They say we can eat whatever we catch!



Sylvain: A fishing tournament, huh? Sounds fun, but not as fun as reeling in the ladies. Heh! Just kidding, of course. The most important thing right now is preparing for the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. After all, the ladies love nothing more than a winner. And around here, there's no bigger game.
Byleth: That's the wrong reason to compete.
Sylvain: Everyone has their own reasons to fight. At least I'm honest about mine.
Byleth: I'm sure they do. 
Sylvain: I knew you'd understand, Professor.



Mercedes: Hmm... Ah! I'm so sorry! I was lost in thought.
Byleth: You seem a bit down. 
Mercedes: It's very kind of you to be concerned, but I promise that I'm fine. I was just thinking... The Death Knight's true identity. Could it actually be Professor Jeritza?
Byleth: What were you thinking about?
Mercedes: The Death Knight's true identity. Could it actually be Professor Jeritza?



Annette: Gronder Field is in the Empire, right? I wonder how we'll get there. I thought I heard that there's no path that goes straight from the monastery to the Empire... Oh! Perhaps we'll travel through Alliance territory. Yes, I see, from the east, we would go...hm, there! Ah, yes, that must be it!



Ingrid: Holding such a frivolous and downright ridiculous event so close to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion... It's absolutely absurd. Although...they did say we could eat whatever we catch. I'm a sucker for a good meal...I just couldn't resist.



Lorenz: I received a rare letter from my father recently. He said that he is praying for the Golden Deer House to emerge victorious. Insistently praying. My father attended the Officers Academy, and won a glorious victory in the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. I think he is quite proud of that, even to this day. I suppose that shows how great an honor it truly is.



Raphael: Hey, Professor! Did you hear about the fishing tournament? You get to fish in the pond as much as you want. The more you catch, the more you get to eat!



Ignatz: Sometimes it's nice to dangle a fishing line and let your mind wander. I'd love to spend some time lounging around by a scenic river or lake.



Lysithea: Why would we go all the way to Gronder Field? It's idiocy to travel that far. It may be a tradition, but it takes forever to get there and is exhausting. So pointless. I guess there's nothing to be done about it. Even by you, Professor.



Marianne: Excuse me, Professor. Um, do you think it would reflect poorly on me if I chose not to take part in the Battle of the Eagle and Lion?
Byleth: Yes, it would.
Marianne: Oh, I see...
Byleth: Don't you want to participate? 
Marianne: Well, I don't really want to leave the monastery...
Marianne: I'm not very confident, but I'll try my best.



Hilda: Professor, do you have a second? It's about Monica. Does she seem...off to you? She was imprisoned for a long time, but she seems to have recovered almost instantly, and she's been bizarrely cheerful.
Byleth: Now that you mention it... 
Hilda: You see what I mean? I wonder if she's straining to seem happy, just to make people comfortable.
Byleth: She's moving on. Isn't that a good thing?
Hilda: I guess you're right. It just seems fast, doesn't it?
Hilda: Hmm... And why is she so close to Edelgard anyway?



Leonie: Why are they having a fishing tournament now? Are they just giving up on the battle of the Eagle and Lion?! You're not condoning this, right? Are you?!

Byleth: Yes, I'm taking part.
Leonie: What?! If you've got all this free time, shouldn't you be spending it on your students?
Byleth: No, I'm not taking part. 
Leonie: Good. I'm looking forward to seeing you in action. I hope Captain Jeralt will be watching.



Rhea: The situation last month was dire indeed. The students endured great hardship. I hope you are able to put all of that behind you so that you may focus on this month's assignment.
Byleth: Of course.
Rhea: A most reassuring response. I trust that your class is in good hands.
Byleth: It will be difficult. 
Rhea: That is to be expected. I, too, cannot quite shake that feeling of unease. Even so, we must both strive to put that nasty business behind us.
Rhea: I look forward to seeing your skills on display at the Battle of the Eagle and Lion.




Seteth: I have something to ask of you.
Byleth: What is it?
Byleth: Leave it to me. 
Seteth: I have not even told you what my request is yet! Well, fine.
Seteth: Flayn has been through an awful lot this past month. To make up for that, I have decided to give her whatever she wants. I asked her what she would like, and she expressed a desire for a feast of fish. Since I'm sure the students would be interested, I have decided to hold a fishing tournament here at the monastery. I have left all of the specifics to Shamir. Please, enter and put in your best effort.

Seteth: I hear that you participated in the fishing tournament. I appreciate you taking the time.



Flayn: I told my brother I had a craving for some tasty fish. I did not realize when I did that it would turn into...well, this. My apologies.



Alois: I'm going to catch me some mighty fish, just you wait and see! Er, but they haven't been biting...
Byleth: Your shouting is scaring the fish. 
Alois: What shouting? Everyone told me I was too loud, so I've been using my quiet voice.
Byleth: Maybe the fish are frightened by you. 
Alois: I didn't think of that. Ah, the truth is right in front of me...  Just kidding. As though a fish is smart enough to be afraid of me.



Catherine: Can you believe what Seteth said? "Catch some tasty fish for Flayn." I'm her bodyguard!




Shamir: Welcome to the monastery fishing tournament. You look confused. Didn't Seteth tell you about it? Just catch whatever fish Flayn requests. Show any fish you catch to Flayn.



Shamir: The fishing tournament is over. I heard you did some fishing, and that Flayn is happy.



Gilbert: Professor, has Seteth told you? We're to have a fishing tournament. Given the events of the last month, I believe this is just the sort of distraction we need, staff and student alike.
Byleth: Will you take part?
Gilbert: I'm afraid I am not one for festivities. I do enjoy a spot of fishing, though.
Byleth: Are you good at fishing? 
Gilbert: I do enjoy the sport, yet I wouldn't say I'm particularly good at it.
Gilbert: I believe it best that I stick to quietly fishing by myself.



Jeralt: The recent happenings at the monastery... There is something going on behind the scenes here. I've been commissioned to investigate as well. As I've already mentioned, this month I'm off to the Kingdom. You be on your guard, OK?
Byleth: I'm not worried.
Jeralt: Well, I hope you're right.
Byleth: I'm more worried about you than myself.
Jeralt:  Perhaps I've gotten into your head too much! I won't go dying on you. I've stayed alive this long, after all.

Jeralt: How are preparations for the Battle of the Eagle and Lion going? Hm? Fishing? Taking it easy, are you?



Hanneman: I don' t know if you've heard, but Flayn is very special. Her blood carries a rare Crest... Oh, the lengths to which she could advance my research, if only I was allowed to study her! If only it weren't for Seteth's strict orders! He protects his sister with unusual zeal.
Byleth: You should give up. 
Hanneman: I dislike it, but I agree. The time I would spend begging him and accomplishing nothing would be better spent on other research.
Byleth: Maybe you can convince him.
Hanneman: Have you ever tried convincing Seteth of anything? I'm not sure I could convince the man the sky is blue if he hadn't already looked up for himself.



Manuela: I always thought I was pretty good, you know? Then I go and get stabbed. Ugh... But my opponent was the Death Knight, so I figure I did pretty well to only get stabbed. I wonder if it's true that he is actually Jeritza... Whoever he is...I'm going to make him pay. It turns out that when I get stabbed, I get really mad!
Byleth: He hurt you this time. Next time he may kill you.
Byleth: I'll help you get revenge. 
Manuela: I'm not going to let him get the better of me again!



Tomas: When you feel that first refreshing breeze upon your face, you know it is almost time for the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. Gronder Field is within the Empire, but the path there from the monastery necessitates passing through Alliance territory. FÃ³dlan's biggest river, the Airmid River, flows along the border between the Empire and the Alliance. You will have to cross one of the largest bridges upon that river, the Great Bridge of Myrddin.



Cyril: FÃ³dlan is big. It's not as big as Almyra is, but it's still pretty big.
Byleth: Do you want to travel around FÃ³dlan someday? 
Cyril: Travel? I don't know... Never thought about it, I guess.
Byleth: Do you want to go home to Almyra?
Cyril: Why do you think I would want to do that?



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Young Monica disappeared last year. I thought she had simply run along home. But it turns out she was kidnapped! I can't believe it. How awful it must have been for the poor thing. They say her personality is completely changed, but at least she seems more cheerful than before. Grateful to be alive, perhaps?

Monk: Ah, I see. So you are Jeralt's child. You so resemble your mother.
Byleth: Did you know my mother?
Monk: I did indeed. I was acquainted with your parents. I've been wanting to speak with you for a while now.
Byleth: Who might you be?
Monk: I am nothing more than a common monk. I knew your parents...once upon a time.
Monk: I've been gone from the monastery for some time now because... Well, it matters not. Might I...ask a favor? Do you mind terribly picking up some fresh flowers to place upon your mother's grave? I am certain she'd be deeply moved to receive a gift from you.

@Intro 
^start 
Caspar: Gronder Field is in the Empire. It's actually part of my family's territory - House Bergliez. It is the largest field in all of FÃ³dlan. The grain it produces sustains the whole Empire. Wait... I sure hope we don't destroy all that grain.
Hubert: It is considered the most suitable place for a large-scale battle.
Edelgard: Professor, if it were up to you, how would you approach this battle?
Byleth: I would fight them head-on. 
Byleth: I would surprise them with clever schemes. 
Edelgard: That sounds like a certain someone we both know. But as you wish. We'll use whatever strategy you think is best. If the Black Eagle House bands together, we won't lose.
Hubert: Our strength is superior. So if we do lose, it would be on your shoulders, Professor.
Ferdinand: If you're not confident you can do this, just sit back and leave it to me.
Hubert:  The most you will do is make things worse. You'll just get in Lady Edelgard's way.
Caspar: Are you two about to fight? Haha! Count me in! Wait, no. I think we all need to calm down.
Petra: We have no lack of opponents. I am ready to go hunting for our enemies!
Dorothea: Hunting isn't exactly... Well, I guess they're pretty similar, actually.
Bernadetta: I'm just gonna hide in the fort and cheer everyone on. There, um, is a fort, right?
Linhardt: Sure, but it's deep in enemy territory. How kind of you to offer to cut through for us.
Bernadetta: What?! No! That's not what I meant! Ugh, good work Bernie...
Linhardt: This will be your first battle, won't it, Flayn? You don't seem nervous at all.
Flayn: Haha, I shall give it my all!
Edelgard: Our battle will begin shortly. The flag of the Black Eagles will soon grace Gronder Field!

Dimitri: So, this is to be our battlefield...Gronder Field. Are you feeling confident, Professor?
Byleth: Very. 
Dimitri: Excellent. That's most reassuring.
Byleth: I'm not so sure. 
Dimitri: We've seen your power firsthand, so we know better than anyone what you're capable of. Beyond that, we believe in you. If it's not too big a burden, I ask that you believe in us as well.
Dimitri: We can win. I'm sure of it. After all, it's not as though we've spent the last half-year sitting idle. And I'm feeling stronger this moon. As though I could conquer a thousand opponents all on my own.
Byleth: That's reassuring. 
Dimitri: You can depend on me. I hope you know that.
Byleth: Don't get carried away...
Dimitri: I'm only joking, of course... But perhaps it isn't a laughing matter. I beg your forgiveness. I must practice levity so that I can provide a more enjoyable joke when the opportunity next presents itself. After all, I hear that telling jokes is a good way to calm the nerves before heading into battle. Still...I find it quite difficult.
Dimitri: Well, it's about time for the battle to begin. Everyone, brace yourselves.
Felix: Hmph. All I'm worried about is finding someone worthy to cross swords with.
Mercedes: We've prepared and trained a great deal. We should be fine, right?
Annette: You're always so carefree, Mercie! Don't forget we need to try our hardest out there so we can win!
Ashe: This is our chance to show how hard we've been working! Let's do our best.
Sylvain: If I emerge victorious in the lauded Battle of the Eagle and Lion, the ladies are sure to take notice. I'll have to go into hiding.
Ingrid: Ugh, is that all you think about? Actually, as long as you try your hardest, frame it however you like.
Flayn: Haha, I shall give it my all!
Dedue: No matter the battle, I will never falter.
Dimitri: We're counting on your guidance, Professor. Let's show the world what the Blue Lions are made of!

Claude: So this is Gronder Field... Hey, Teach. Not a bad place to wage war, is it?
Byleth: How so?
Byleth: Absolutely. 
Claude: I knew you'd understand.
Claude: Plenty of places to hide, and our pick of paths to advance through. It's the perfect battlefield for our tactics. I have my eye on that low hill over there. See it? It's the ideal spot to lure our enemies to, and then surround them with fire.
Byleth: It's risky.
Byleth: Fire is unacceptable.
Claude: Gotcha, Teach! I know, I know. We want all students to make it back to the monastery. With you in command, we can't lose. The Imperial princess and the crown prince don't stand a chance.
Hilda: Professor! Claude! What are you two talking about?
Lorenz: What do you expect? It's Claude. I expect he was foisting more of his ill-advised schemes on our poor professor.
Claude: Oh, you have me all figured out, Lorenz. You know me better than I know myself.
Ignatz: Win or lose, it's an honor just to participate in the legendary Battle of the Eagle and Lion!
Leonie: We've got to win so we can show Captain Jeralt what we're made of!
Raphael: Yes! I'm ready! Let's go!
Flayn: Haha, I shall give it my all!
Marianne: I'll just...stay quiet and follow along so I don't get in anyone's way.
Lysithea: That will not be acceptable, Marianne. The whole point of this exercise is for each house to act as one.
Hilda: Do your best! I can't wait to see how well everyone does.
Claude: All right, sounds like Hilda will be taking control of a central hill and watching the battle from there.
Claude: It's almost time. Come on, Teach! The battle starts now!
^end

@Cutscene 
Dimitri: You all should know... I am not about to go easy on you today.

Claude: As long as we can pull off the win, it doesn't matter how.

Edelgard: Our victory must be absolute...no matter what it may take.

Seteth: It is time.

Edelgard: Forward! now!

Dimitri: For honor!

@Opening 
The Battle of the Eagle and Lion, a traditional contest of strength between the three houses, has arrived. It will take place at Gronder Field, which lies in Imperial territory.

@Battle 
Dimitri: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion is set to begin at long last. Everyone, show off the results of your dedicated training!

Claude: Remember, we're not just fighting for honor. There's a prize at stake!

Edelgard: It's almost time to begin. Steel yourselves, everyone.

Claude: The Black Eagles and Blue Lions are fighting... Maybe we can sneak right past them.
Lorenz: A stronghold for me to seize? Splendid!
Claude: There goes Lorenz, acting on his own... Guess we've got no choice but to capture the central hill and cover him!

Dimitri: This could be our chance! Dedue, cut through the Golden Deer!
Dimitri: Ingrid, make use of your mobilityâcircle back behind the Black Eagles!
Dimitri: Mobile force, you move up as well! Circle around to the rear of the Black Eagles!

Edelgard: If you intend to act, do it now. Hubert! Head toward the Golden Deer!
Edelgard: Ferdinand, circle around to the back of the Blue Lions.
Edelgard: Mobile force, you move up as well. Circle around behind the Blue Lions.

Dimitri: The Black Eagles and the Golden Deer are already in battle? We should take this chance to break through the Black Eagle's flank.
Dedue: I will draw the Black Eagles out, Your Highness.
Dimitri: Yes, and while you are doing so, we will take control of the central hill.

@Boss 
%Byleth,Edelgard
Edelgard: If you stand in my way, I will cut you down until you have no blood left to bleed.
Byleth: ...
Edelgard: What? I was just trying to rally your spirits. Now, to victory!

%Claude,Edelgard
Claude: Hey Princess! Heads up! There's a rat right by your Imperial feet...
Edelgard: BAH! IâHuh. How dare you make a fool of me. You will not rile me with such childish tactics.
Claude: Ah, so the sheer terror in your eyes was... something else entirely. My mistake. Anyway, it was only a joke.
Edelgard: You really hope to unsettle me with childish jokes? It won't work. You must stand and fight!

%Dimitri,Edelgard
Dimitri: So, it is time to cross blades... I never imagined such a day would come to pass.
Edelgard: If the Empire and the Kingdom go to war, we'll be able to fight as much as we please.
Dimitri: I am sorry, but that is not something to joke about. The thought of fighting you is troubling at best.
Edelgard: In that case, I wonder when you'll be able to stomach facing me in battle... Do you need a few moments?

%Byleth,Claude 
Claude: This is a great chance for me to find out if the Sword of the Creator really is all it's cracked up to be. On that note, you'd better not surrender too quickly!

%Dimitri,Claude 
Claude: Hey, Your Royalness! If you promise to let me have the prize, I'll let you take the honor of victory. Do we have a deal?
Dimitri: Enough of your foolishness! Iâ Wait a moment. You are trying to anger me, is that it?
Claude: Saw right through me, did you? Well, if there's no deal, I'll just have to win this thing fair and square!
Dimitri: I will happily face you, here and now. Do not hold back, Claude!

%Byleth,Dimitri 
Dimitri: How far can I push myself with you as my foe... This will be a great chance to test our mettle. Do not underestimate me, Professor, or you will fail!

@Character-Falls
Edelgard: I'm sorry, but I must retreat... You should have no trouble winning. Don't give up!

Edelgard: I hate to admit it...but it seems this is as far as the Black Eagle House goes.

Claude: Sorry, but it's about time I make my exit... The rest of you...please, finish the job!

Claude: I hate to say it, but it seems we're at a stalemate. Looks like the Golden Deer won't be winning this round...

Dimitri: I fear I cannot fight any longer. I'm sorry, everyone... Please continue onward to victory!

Dimitri: I suppose my training wasn't enough... The Blue Lions have no choice but to retreat.

@End
Seteth: That is the end of this year's Battle of the Eagle and Lion! And the winners are... The Black Eagles!
Edelgard: Thank you for your hard work, everyone! I daresay that prize is as good as ours.

Seteth: That is the end of this year's Battle of the Eagle and Lion! And the winners are... The Golden Deer!
Claude: A victory worthy of a feast! We did so well, there's no way we didn't secure that prize.

Seteth: That is the end of this year's Battle of the Eagle and Lion! And the winners are... The Blue Lions!
Dimitri: We won! And judging by our performance, I'm certain we have earned the prize as well.

^start 
Dimitri: Edelgard. Professor. That was a spectacular battle. You both fought exceptionally well.
Claude: Complete and utter defeat... I would hate to make an enemy of you two.
Edelgard: No need to get carried away with praise. I know you both feel we won by a paper-thin margin. And I won't deny it. If we were to fight again, there's no telling who would prevail. What do you think, Professor?
Byleth: The Blue Lion House was very strong. 
Dimitri: I am honored to hear you say that. Still, I must continue to train rigorously.
Byleth: The Golden Deer House was very strong. 
Claude: I'm honored! And I'll level with you - I think that margin is at least as wide as two sheets of paper. I mean that.
Byleth: They were nothing. 
Edelgard: Professor?! Well, I suppose it's OK to let victory go to your head just this once.
Claude: In any case, I hope the day never comes when we have to put this experience to use.
Dimitri: Agreed. I would hate to know a future in which I'm forced to cross swords with you.
Edelgard: True. Although the Battle of the Eagle and Lion was originally named after a war between the Empire and the Kingdom. But that's all in the past. I'm sure even the name will one day fade from the pages of history.
Byleth: I hope so.
Byleth: Let's do our best to get along.
Claude: How admirable, Teach! On that note, I have a proposition. When we get back to Garreg Mach, let's have a grand feast to bring down the walls between our respective houses. And by a "grand" feast, I mean a fairly regular feast in the dining hall.
Dimitri: It would be a fine opportunity to know each other better. Count me in.
Edelgard: So be it. Let's plan to meet up on the night we return. Is that OK with you, Professor?
Byleth: I'm looking forward to it.
Byleth: We'll celebrate our victory. 
Edelgard: What's gotten into you today? I'm not used to seeing you this excited.
Edelgard:  Seeing such a big smile on your face is a rare gift... It makes me feel like I can maybe relax a little too.

Claude: Well done, Your Princeliness. I'm certainly not in any hurry to get on your bad side.
Edelgard: I assumed you would attack us head-on. I clearly need to rethink my opinion of you. Well done, Dimitri.
Dimitri: You both deserve equal praise for a battle well fought. All three houses did extremely well. Don't you agree, Professor?
Byleth: The Black Eagle House was very strong. 
Edelgard: Not strong enough, clearly. If there's ever a next time, know that I plan to wipe that smile from your face.
Byleth: The Golden Deer House was very strong. 
Claude: It's an honor to hear that from a fighter such as yourself! But there's no getting around it. The Blue Lions were better prepared.
Byleth: They were nothing. 
Dimitri: It only seemed that way because of the caliber of your command. Even now, we must not allow ourselves to become complacent.
Claude: In any case, I hope the day never comes when we have to put this experience to use.
Edelgard: I wouldn't mind. I'll accept a challenge from either of you at any time. Heh, I'm kidding, of course!
Dimitri: That is nothing to joke about. The true Battle of the Eagle and Lion is best left in the past. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they eventually change the name of this mock battle.
Byleth: I hope so.
Byleth: Let's do our best to get along.
Claude: How admirable, Teach! On that note, I have a proposition. When we get back to Garreg Mach, let's have a grand feast to bring down the walls between our respective houses. And by a "grand" feast, I mean a fairly regular feast in the dining hall.
Edelgard: You really value that kind of thing, don't you? Well, I suppose no harm can come from it. Count me in.
Dimitri: I have no objections either. And you, Professor?
Byleth: I'm looking forward to it.
Byleth: We'll celebrate our victory.
Dimitri: Oh! Well, I'm not sure that's the point... Uh, Professor? Was that...a joke?
Dimitri: You look so...happy. I love seeing you like this. I suppose that look on your face is just another boon from this glorious day. Perhaps the best one of all.

Edelgard: Well done, Claude. I see your schemes are not to be underestimated.
Dimitri: Yes, I must wholeheartedly agree. As ever, I have proven to be no match for you.
Claude: It is the utmost honor to receive praise from your royalâ  I'm kidding, of course. Really, though, I was lucky to have Teach on my side. In all honesty, you two made me work for it. If I had to face you again, there's no telling which way it would go. What do you think, Teach? How did the other houses fare?
Byleth: The Blue Lion House was very strong. 
Dimitri: I appreciate that. Still, it is clear that I must continue to be rigorous in my training.
Byleth: The Black Eagle House was very strong. 
Edelgard: Not strong enough, clearly. If there's ever a next time, know that I plan to wipe that smile from your face.
Byleth: They were nothing. 
Claude: Too true, Teach! That just about sums it up. Oh, I'm sorry. That's probably too hard for the losers to hear, isn't it?
Claude: In any case, I hope the day never comes when we have to put this experience to use.
Dimitri: Agreed. I would hate to know a future in which I'm forced to cross swords with you.
Edelgard: I wouldn't mind. I'll accept a challenge from either of you at any time. Heh, I'm kidding, of course!
Claude: Well, now that the three-way battle has ended in an Alliance victory, I daresay it's time for some post-battle reconciliation. The victor has but one request. Hear me out... When we get back to Garreg Mach, let's have a grand feast to bring down the walls between our respective houses. And by a "grand" feast, I mean a fairly regular feast in the dining hall.
Dimitri: Hmph. I accept your proposition. Please notify me once your preparations are complete.
Edelgard: It seems I have no choice but to drown my sorrow at losing in overindulgence. I'll help you with the preparations.
Claude: It's not a feast if you don't eat too much! Leave it to the Imperial princess to say such wonderful things.
Edelgard: That's not exactly what I said, but... Ugh, forget it. Laugh all you want.
Claude: Oh, if you insist! Hahahaha! Hey, Teach. Looks like you're having a good time too. Seeing you smile like that means we've got no choice but to have a great time tonight. Let's get going!

Bernadetta: It's finally over... There were way too many strangers at that feast.
Petra: Put your chin high, Bernie. It was a chance for you to have growth.
Bernadetta: But... but everyone was acting so friendly! It was overwhelming...
Caspar: Linhardt, I wasn't done talking to you! If those Alliance guys came at it from here and those Kingdom guys came from there-
Linhardt: I know, I know. We'd have been able to take them all out at once. I heard you. I'm going to bed now.
Dorothea: Did anyone get the feeling that there were already couples forming? That's not really fair, is it? I wanted to sneak off with someone too...
Ferdinand: I was hoping for some tea after our meal anyway. Would you care to join me?
Dorothea: I suppose I can settle for you just this once, Ferdie.
Edelgard: Until today, I thought it would fall to me to command and guide our ranks all by myself. But with you leading us, I've gotten to experience what it's like to fight alongside everyone... And I've realized... how happy it makes me, fighting under your command. The emperor doesn't take orders from anyone. It's their duty to stand alone and lead the entire Empire. But maybe it's better to have someone to rely on... so that you can support and guide each other through the darkness.
Byleth: Am I that someone? 
Byleth: I am unfit to guide an emperor. 
Edelgard: I may be heir to the Imperial throne, but first and foremost, I'm your grateful student. That will never change, even when I fulfill my destiny and become the emperor. I told you long ago that I wished to enlist you in the service of the Empire. Well, I take it back. Now I wish only for your continued guidance during my eventual reign.
Linhardt: Don't just hide away in the corner, Professor. You're the reason we're celebrating.
Bernadetta: It's because of you that I've had the courage to leave my room for a bit each day.  I'm...I'm so grateful, Professor!
Ferdinand: We were all just discussing how well you led us. Remarkable!
Petra:  Your guidance is without parallel, Professor.  I have had practicing of that phrase.
Caspar: Your training's been top notch. Really!
Dorothea: Whatever would we do without you?
Flayn: I have had the opportunity to experience much. Please allow me to offer you my gratitude once more, Professor.
Edelgard: I feel the same... You are something special, my teacher.

Dimitri: I had a wonderful time today, Professor. As usual, I was astonished by how much you ate in the name of celebration! Really, though, I must thank you again. Our victory in the Battle of the Eagle and Lion was thanks, in no small part, to you.
Byleth: We all did our part. 
Dimitri: Yes, that is true, but it was your instruction that allowed us to reach our full potential.
Byleth: I agree.
Dimitri: That's the spirit! There's nothing wrong with acknowledging your own strengths every now and then.
Dimitri: I feel silly admitting this now, but when you first came to lead our class...you unnerved me. You never smiled, and you never showed anger either. And yet, you didn't appear to be suppressing your emotions. They just...weren't there. At first I thought perhaps you just didn't care for us, but I soon concluded that wasn't the case at all. For the longest time I just couldn't tell what you were thinking. It was as though you had no humanity whatsoever...
Byleth: That stings.
Byleth: And now?
Dimitri: You're different now. In the half-year we've spent together, I've seen the glow of humanity in your eyes and in your actions countless times. I am truly grateful to have had the chance to spend this time with you, Professor.
Sylvain: What are you two talking about? How dare you get chummy without us!
Sylvain: Getting cozy, are we? Mind if I cut in?
Dedue: That's enough, Sylvain.
Mercedes: Oh please, I would love to join you as well! I have so many things I wish to talk to you about, Professor.
Annette: Oh, me too! I have so much to tell you! And I want to thank you too.
Ashe: Honestly Professor? I was only able to achieve so much because you were with us.
Ingrid: Ashe is right. You're irreplaceable to us, Professor.
Annette: Yes, that! Without you, the Blue Lions... Well, we wouldn't even be the Blue Lions at all! Except for the blue part. Because we'd be sad.
Felix: I suppose...there are worse things than fighting at your side.
Flayn: I have had the opportunity to experience much. Please allow me to offer you my gratitude once more, Professor.
Dimitri: Haha, as you can see, you have our trust, as well as our admiration. I look forward to spending the rest of the year with you.
Byleth: As do I.
Dimitri: Good. Then let's give it our all this year! Anyhow... It's getting late. We had better return to our quarters and get some rest.

Hilda: Ugh, I can't believe our house leader ate so much he passed out. I guess he should just...sleep it off? Oh, Professor! Great work today!
Ignatz: As long as we have you and Claude, the Golden Deer House is unstoppable!
Lorenz: I am sure we did not require Claude for our victory, but it certainly would not have been possible without our professor.
Lysithea: Haha! I'm so please to be in your class, Professor. You truly bring out the best in us.
Raphael: Let's keep fighting! And winning!
Leonie: I knew the tactics you learned from the captain would be something else. I better work harder to catch up!
Flayn: I have had the opportunity to experience much. Please allow me to offer you my gratitude once more, Professor.
Marianne: Because of you, I managed to get through the fight without feeling like a burden. Thank you, Professor.
Hilda: I hear Lady Rhea and Seteth are singing your praises too!
Byleth: You all worked hard. 
Hilda: You're always so modest!
Byleth: Our opponents were strong too.
Hilda: Well, I certainly can't deny that.
Byleth: Just wait until you see my true power. 
Hilda: Oh, wow! I don't doubt it.
Claude: You really showed them, Teach! I would really hate to be on your bad side.
Hilda: Oh, look. Claude has been revived.
Claude: Your tactics were ingenious, and you've somehow mastered the power of the King of Liberation's Relic. You really are incredible. Though you can be a bit absentminded at times. Your mind is like a giant bowl with a tiny crack in it...
Hilda: Claude, saying that only makes your own mind bowl seem tiny.
Claude: How dare you! My bowl is much bigger than Teach's! Unfortunately, it doesn't just have a crack. The whole bottom of my bowl is missing.
Lysithea: In other words, you are the absentminded one, not our professor.
Ignatz: That's true. He just admitted it.
Marianne: Hehe!
Leonie: It's unusual to hear you laughing, Marianne. Your smile is really cute.
Lorenz: I agree. You really don't know how beauti-- Eh... Never mind.
Hilda: It feels so great to laugh and joke around like this, doesn't it?  Hm? Well, look at that. Someone's having a secret rendezvous in the courtyard...
Claude: All joking aside, I'm having trouble sizing you up, Teach. The honest truth is that I'd hate to have you as an enemy. If possible, I wish for you to fight by my side. If I could use the Sword of the Creator, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. I bet if I could use it, you would trust me to... Right? That selflessness may be what I like best about you.
^end

Rhea: You fought bravely during the Battle of the Eagle and Lion.
Seteth: Comparing against their performance in the mock battle of the Great Tree Moon, the students have grown significantly. I suppose I should praise your efforts.
Rhea: I can only call your deeds during the Battle of the Eagle and Lion...quite versatile.
Seteth: Comparing against their performance in the mock battle of the Great Tree Moon, the students have grown significantly. It is clear that this is a result of your guidance.
Rhea: In appreciation of your efforts, and to show our high hopes for the future of your students, I award you with this.
Rhea: Please continue to instruct your students as a model teacher.
Sothis: So! You've made good use of all my power after all. I would have been upset if you had failed at such an easy task!
Seteth: It pains me to assign such a disturbing mission to you during such a blessed moment in time... However, next month your assignment will be to journey to Remire Village to investigate an abnormal occurrence there.
Sothis: Remire Village... If I recall, you've been there with your father many times.
Byleth: An abnormal occurrence?
Seteth: I have yet to ascertain the details, but it would seem the villages have been acting strangely. I have already dispatched the knights to verify the authenticity of this information. They should be back shortly. I suggest you begin by finding out what they have discovered.

Rhea: I pray this is not a bad omen... May the goddess protect you all.

@Opening 
When the warm winds blow from the sea to the south of Adrestia, residents of FÃ³dlan know that the rainy season is upon them. Before the heavy rains take their toll, young women hurry to pick the last of the white roses. The ivory buds are woven into garlands and given as gifts to close friends or potential lovers.

@Intro 
Rhea: Professor, I have a new mission for your students.
Seteth: We have received reports that Lord Lonato has rallied troops against the Holy Church of Seiros.
Byleth: Who is Lord Lonato?
Byleth: Why would he do that?
Rhea: Lord Lonato is a minor lord of the Kingdom. He has been showing hostility towards the church for some time now.
Seteth: A vanguard unit from the Knights of Seiros is already on its way to his stronghold, Castle Gaspard. Lord Lonato's army is nothing compared to the knights. It's quite possible the rebellion has already been suppressed.
Rhea: Even so, I would like for your class to travel with the knights' rear guard to deal with the aftermath.
Seteth: War zones are unpredictable. We do not expect you will have cause to battle, but be prepared for the worst.

Catherine: Excuse me. You sent for me, Lady Rhea?
Rhea: This is Catherine. She will be leading the knights whom you will be accompanying.
Catherine: Nice to meet you. We've heard a lot about you. If you need anything, just ask.
Rhea: She is one of our bravest knights, and that is no small feat. Only an exceptional few have what it takes to join the Knights of Seiros. This mission should prove useful in demonstrating to the students how foolish it would be to ever turn their blades on the Church...

@Conversation 
Sothis: You have spent quite some time in here, engaging in such idle chatter. Do you not know that we do not have a moment left to waste?
Byleth: I had forgotten.
Sothis: Forgotten? I don't believe that is the truth. No, it is more likely you were dreaming the whole day away. You must try harder from now on.
Byleth: I should have listened more intently. 
Sothis: You must try harder from now on.




Edelgard: Even within the Knights of Seiros, Catherine is the strongest. By a large margin from what I've gathered. Why not seek her out as a sparring partner, professor?



Edelgard: Lord Lonato must know that his efforts are futile...yet he can't help but fight. If I were in that situation, I would do whatever it took to ensure victory. You can count on that.




Dimitri: Doubtless, there are times when one must take up their blade, even if there's no chance of winning. But this... It's downright senseless. Lord Lonato knows better. If he had enough allies to back his rebellion, it would be a different matter...
Byleth: Allies?
Byleth: How so?
Dimitri: Ah, my apologies. I was just thinking aloud. This whole situation is a bit too strange for my liking. Even with the necessary preparations in place, there is always a chance that something unexpected will occur. Please be ready for anything, Professor.



Dimitri: After Faerghus lost its king, there were many rebellions. It is likely Lord Lonato's provocations are related. How frustrating that I am too young to take the throne. Rendered powerless by age... If the throne is vacant much longer, the Kingdom will fall to ruin!




Claude: First that bandit business, and now a noble rebellion? Are we ever gonna do anything but find and subdue people? Well, if we're just going to tie up loose ends, at least it'll be pretty safe. I don't mind stretching my legs for this one. And if Catherine's going, too, there's a good chance we'll get a look at her Relic in action.



Claude: Hey, Teach. There's some minor noble rebelling in Faerghus, right? He has no chance of winning. I wonder what he hopes to achieve... Huh? Are you going along to help? Sounds like an easy victory, but good luck out there.



Hubert: Something about this situation doesn't feel right. Why would a minor lord raise an army against a foe he cannot possibly hope to defeat?




Ferdinand: My central duty as a noble is to protect the commonfolk. I abhor those like Lord Lonato, who deliberately shatter the peace. Utterly disgraceful.
Byleth: He must have his reasons.
Byleth: I hope no one is hurt. 
Ferdinand: You have a kind soul, Professor. Now I feel a little sheepish for showing anger and not empathy. I apologize for my impetuousness.



Ferdinand: I heard about your class's assignment, by the way. Good luck subduing those treasonous nobles!



Linhardt: Professor, I feel I must speak to you about Caspar's eating habits. I've never seen the likes of it. He inhales entire plates of food in mere seconds.
Byleth: Sounds unhealthy. 
Linhardt: Hence my mentioning it to you. Good luck with him.
Byleth: He must have a healthy appetite.
Linhardt: If that is a polite way of calling him a goat, I'm inclined to agree.



Caspar: Today's meal was delicious! Linhardt keeps bothering me about eating too fast. Says I'm gonna choke or something.
Byleth: It's not safe to each so quickly.
Caspar: You're really gonna agree with that guy? Why is no one here on my side?
Byleth: When you're busy there's no alternative. 
Caspar: Absolutely! I knew you'd see things my way.

Bernadetta: âªHm hm-hm hm-hm... âª H-huh?! Um, is someone there? What do you want?




Dorothea: Professor, about this month's assignment... Raising an army against the church? Really? Though it looks like we won't be fighting, it's still quite unsettling. My understanding is that it will all be subdued rather quickly.



Dorothea: Are you going to fight alongside the Knights of Seiros? Hmm... Let me know if you meet anyone I might be interested in, OK?




Petra: The plants of FÃ³dlan are different ones than in Brigid. And people here are unknowing of the spirits who watch over the earth and bless it. Only the goddess is known. Is that factual?



Petra: This flower is one that is eating insects. Is that factual too? I am wondering who watches over the plants in FÃ³dlan...




Dedue: His Highness is strong. But on the front lines, anything can happen. Losing him would be devastating for Faerghus. I hope the church understands that.



Dedue: Best be on your guard.



Felix: Catherine, hm? Her skill is impressive, I'll admit. So is her sword. But I think she's hiding something. Nobody knows anything about her past. You should spar with her. She's strong. Stronger than you are, I'd bet.




Ashe: Ngh... Please, Professor, there must be some mistake. Lonato would never raise arms against the church. At least, he never said anything to me about it.



Ashe: What's going to happen to Lonato? If he's killed, I... I don't know how I'll live with that.




Sylvain: Professor, have you seen Felix around? I swear, as soon as you take your eyes off himâpoofâhe's gone.
Byleth: I saw him at the training ground. 
Sylvain: Ah, of course he's there. Sorry for bothering you, Professor. Thanks!
Byleth: I saw him at the dining hall.
Sylvain: Ah, right, it is meal time. Sorry for bothering you, Professor. Thanks!

Sylvain: Don't you love looking after horses? I do. They repay your absolute love and trust with the same. I wish girls were so easy to deal with...



Mercedes: I've heard whispers about Lord Lonato. They say he is a very kind and gentle lord. Why would such a kind man suddenly raise an army? Oh, Professor. You were working late last night, weren't you? You shouldn't overdo it. A ghost might rise up from the well to get you if you stay you too late! Or so I'm told.




Annette: We're going on a mission with the knights, right? I wonder if... Oh... Sorry! It's nothing. I was just wondering if someone I've been searching for might be among them.
Byleth: You're looking for a knight?
Annette: Yes. Well...maybe? If he's here, he's probably a knight. Though it's also possible he became a monk...
Byleth: I hope you find whomever you're looking for. 
Annette: Thank you. I'm definitely going to find him one of these days!

Annette: To be honest, I've felt a bit lost here at the monastery. At a loss for what to do. Thankfully, a sweet young girl reached out and offered help. I believe she's Seteth's little sister.




Ingrid: Why does His Highness take the side of the people of Duscur? I just don't understand it. Only four years ago, they murdered our king and slaughtered the soldiers and knights who were with him, all of whom were innocent. Even if he can forgive them, I can'tânot ever. What they've done is against all codes of honor and ethics.



Ingrid: We are truly blessed with how fertile the monastery grounds are. Every day, there's something new to harvest!



Lorenz: It's a noble's duty to protect the commonfolk, not to endanger them by rallying armies in such a feckless and improper manner. Abuse of that kind is no better than slavery. A proper noble must guard the people from such a fate, wouldn't you say?
Byleth: I agree. 
Lorenz: Precisely why true nobility is well respected.
Byleth: We don't know all the details yet.
Lorenz: There can be no legitimate cause for a noble to abandon that basic obligation. Let us put an end to this quickly.



Raphael: Hey, Professor! Do you happen to have any food on you? I'm starving! No matter how much I eat before I train, I'm always so hungry after. My muscles must be going through a growth spurt!



Ignatz: This place has so many breathtaking works of art. I feel like I'm living in a museum. Each piece can teach us about styles and techniques from a thousand years ago!
Byleth: Do you know a lot about art?
Ignatz: I'm from a family of merchants, so I've been able to see a lot of art, but I won't pretend to be an expert.
Byleth: Do you like art? 
Ignatz: Oh yes, very much. I'm from a family of merchants, so I've been able to see a lot of art.




Lysithea: Ah, Professor. It would seem that a minor lord in Faerghus is raising an army... This poses a threat, obviously. But not one for the Kingdomâfor the church. I mean, Faerghus doesnât even have a king at present. Thereâs something...unsettling about this army. You had better ensure weâre fully prepared.

Lysithea: The monastery grounds are far too spread out. Feels like it takes hours to get from one area to another. And, no, that's not because I'm getting lost. I'm a fully capable, mature person! Who never gets lost.



Marianne: Oh. Hello, Professor... Um. Was there something you needed?
Byleth: I came to see the horses. 
Marianne: Oh! You like horses? I like them too. They're such kind creatures.
Byleth: I'm just looking around.
Marianne: I see. I won't bother you, then...




Hilda: Professor, your clothes are a bit dirty. If you don't pay attention to your hygiene, the girls won't like you! I hate when my clothes get dirty. That's one of the many reasons I find it best to train as little as possible.

Hilda: Professor, your clothes are a bit dirty. I'd have expected you to be more careful, seeing as how you're a professor and all. I hate when my clothes get dirty. That's one of the many reasons I find it best to train as little as possible.



Leonie: I'm studying here so I can be the best there is, just like Captain Jeralt. Do you think I've got it in me to be a top tier mercenary, Professor?
Byleth: That depends on how hard you work.
Leonie: I'm going to work a lot harder than all the fancy nobles around here, I can tell you that.
Byleth: You really want to bring the money in, huh? 
Leonie: I do! Though, it's about so much more than being rich. It's about honor.



Rhea: Pointing a sword at the Holy Church of Seiros is akin to pointing a sword at the goddess herself. Meting out appropriate punishments to the sinful... It is a sacred duty with which we have been entrusted. As a member of the church yourself, I hope that you will take that to heart.

Seteth: If you have a moment, I would like to have a word. It has been brought to my attention that certain individuals have been making advances towards Flayn. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
Byleth: Not at all. 
Byleth: Actually...
Seteth: If you do see anyone getting too close with Flayn, please, inform me of it at once.

Flayn: If the flowers within the greenhouse are removed, they will soon wilt and whither... Is that not so, Professor? I feel I can empathize with them... The flowers. Flowers that thriveâdespite their environmentâare truly inspiring, are they not?



Alois: Past here is the Holy Mausoleum, where the saints of the Church of Seiros slumber. Sorry, but only a select few members of the church are allowed entry. It's open to the public on only one day of the year, for the Goddess's Rite of Rebirth.



Catherine: Here to train? You really are as hardworking as they say.
Byleth: That's an overstatement. I'm just me.
Catherine: Spoken like a true hard worker.
Byleth: That's right. I'm a force of nature.
Catherine: Huh. Maybe the gossip's wrong. Hardworking people usually don't like to make a big fuss about it.



Jeritza: What? I desired fresh air.
Byleth: That's not like you.
Jeritza: True...
Byleth: The wind feels nice.
Jeritza: Hmph.



Jeralt: Castle Gaspard, eh? I've been there once before. Many years ago... It was by request of the son of that family... Christophe, I think it was.



Hanneman: I'm sorry, but I must vent to someone, Professor. You're familiar with Manuela's slovenly behavior, yes? That woman! She borrowed a book last week and returned it with stains of unknown origin on the cover, and several pages either folded or torn. Just now, she dropped a sandwich on the floor, picked it up and kept eating. When she saw my shock, she said simply, "Three second rule." Ugh!



Manuela: Did you hear? There's news of someone in the Kingdom raising an army. The Kingdom, the Empire, the Alliance... They do love a good war, don't they? Spilling the blood of young men and women...and for what? Just to enjoy the horror of it?



Tomas: Professor, I heard that you may battle alongside Catherine. Even among the knights, she is something specialâ âa holy knight who is able to wield a Hero's Relic. Still...she can be a mite difficult.



Anna: Hey, Professor. How's it going? Making lots of coin? I'd love to catch up, but I'm super busy right now. Working. For money. You understand.

Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Have you talked with Catherine yet? If the knights are the cream of the crop, she's the cream of the cream. Oh, and that Relic of hers! I hear it's nothing short of amazing.



Knight of Seiros: Since we're heading to Castle Gaspard, that means we'll be passing through Magdred Way. The road is well known for its beautiful surroundings. Depending on the time of year, it can be incredibly foggy, though. When it's like that you can't enjoy the lovely scenery... Lucky for us, it shouldn't be too foggy while we're there. Not that we'll have time for sightseeing anyway.



Knight of Seiros: I hear that Lord Lonato served the king of Faerghus's older brother when he was younger. Or something like that. He already had status and prestige, so why raise a rebellion? Eh, I guess it's none of my business.



Knight of Seiros: Catherine has invited me to train with her. How much do you think I should train before I'm ready to train with someone that strong?



Monk: Lord Lonato... He used to stay at the monastery rather frequently. He was such as pious man. A true believer... Such a terrible shame. I wonder what changed him...



Monk: Next month is when a very important ceremony will be taking place at the monastery. Pilgrims from all corners of FÃ³dlan have already started to gather in anticipation. I pray that you are able to nip this trouble in the bud as soon as possible.



Shifty Merchant: Things we can't obtain here are likely obtainable by way of the underground. Are you unfamiliar with Garreg Mach's underground? The place is an absolute paradise for those who can't stay above ground.



Monk: Those Abyssian idiots. All they ever do is cause trouble. We'd best purge the entire underbelly of Garreg Mach.

@Intro 
^start 
Hubert: No matter how powerful our enemies may be, there is no need to worry so long as we're with Catherine, the mighty wielder of Thunderbrand.
Byleth: Thunderbrand?
Byleth: What are you talking about?
Catherine: You mean you don't know? My weapon is called Thunderbrand. It's one of the Hero's Relics. A long, long time ago, the goddess bestowed divine weapons upon 10 heroes, which were passed down to their descendants. It's an honor to wield, but I'm afraid there won't be any chance for that today. Our mission is to help clean up the aftermath, not to fight.
Hubert: One must wonder why Lord Lonato would incite such a reckless rebellion.
Catherine: It all goes back to the Tragedy of Duscur...
Byleth: I've heard of it.
Edelgard: I remember that day well. No one saw it coming.
Byleth: I don't know much about it.
Edelgard: Roughly four years ago, the king of Faerghus was murdered by the people of Duscur. I believe that about sums it up, correct?
Catherine: To put it simply, yes. But there's more to that story. They had accomplices within the Kingdom as well. Lord Lonato's son, Christophe, was one of them, and so he was handed over to the church for execution.
Byleth: The church executes criminals?
Catherine: Speaking from the church's perspective, we simply passed judgement according to our doctrine in place of the Kingdom, which was in complete chaos.
Byleth: Why was the king targeted?
Catherine: King Lambert was attempting a major political reform. Needless to say, he had many enemies.

Dimitri: I have to say... It's a real honor to accompany such a brave and distinguished knight. None other than Catherine, wielder of Thunderbrand!
Byleth: Thunderbrand?
Catherine: You mean you don't know? My weapon is called Thunderbrand. It's one of the Hero's Relics. A long, long time ago, the goddess bestowed divine weapons upon 10 heroes, which were passed down to their descendants. It's an honor to wield, but I'm afraid there won't be any chance for that today. Our mission is to help clean up the aftermath, not to fight.
Ashe: Why would Lonato incite such a reckless rebellion?
Catherine: You should know more about that than any of us, Ashe.
Ashe: Well, I don't. Lonato never mentioned anything of the like to me.
Dimitri: He probably didn't want you getting caught up in his own personal vendetta.
Byleth: Is Ashe related to Lord Lonato?
Ashe: I'm Lonato's adopted son. He raised me as though I were his own blood. He was always so kind. I don't understand... I guess it has to do with Christophe.
Byleth: What vendetta?
Catherine: How much do you know about the Tragedy of Duscur, Professor?
Byleth: I've heard of it.
Byleth: I don't know much about it.
Catherine: It's when the king of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus was...was murdered by the people of Duscur. It happened about four years ago... 
Dimitri: It's OK, Catherine. Please, go on.
Catherine: Right. Well, Lord Lonato's son, Christophe, was accused of being involved in that whole awful affair. He was executed by the church.
Byleth: The church executes prisoners?
Catherine: Speaking from the church's perspective, we simply passed judgement according to our doctrine in place of the Kingdom, which was in complete chaos.
Byleth: Why was the king targeted?
Dimitri: ...
Catherine: King Lambert was attempting a major political reform. Needless to say, he had many enemies.

Claude: It really is an honor to accompany Catherine, wielder of Thunderbrand. I hear you're intimidating enough to silence the howling winds!
Byleth: Thunderbrand?
Catherine: You mean you don't know? My weapon is called Thunderbrand. It's one of the Hero's Relics. A long, long time ago, the goddess bestowed divine weapons upon 10 heroes, which were passed down to their descendants. It's an honor to wield, but I'm afraid there won't be any chance for that today. Our mission is to help clean up the aftermath, not to fight.
Claude: Why would Lonato incite such a reckless rebellion? He had to have known he had no chance of winning.
Catherine: It all goes back to the Tragedy of Duscur...
Byleth: I've heard of it. 
Byleth: I don't know much about it.
Claude: You must be joking. Where have you been traveling that news of it didn't reach you?
Claude: It happened about four years ago. The king of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus was murdered by the people of Duscur. That about covers it, right?
Catherine: To put it simply, yes. But there's more to that story. They had accomplices within the Kingdom as well. Lord Lonato's son, Christophe, was one of them, and so he was handed over to the church for execution.
Byleth: The church executes criminals?
Catherine: Speaking from the church's perspective, we simply passed judgement according to our doctrine in place of the Kingdom, which was in complete chaos.
Byleth: Why was the king targeted?
Catherine: King Lambert was attempting a major political reform. Needless to say, he had many enemies.
^end
Catherine: Whatever the truth behind that incident may be, Lord Lonato has harbored resentment to the church ever since. Well... To be more specific, his grudge isn't only against the church. It's also against the one who turned Christophe over to them...
Church Soldier: Report! The enemy is approaching! They can't be avoided. Their numbers are far greatly than we predicted. They used the fog to slip past the knights' perimeter!
Catherine: It looks like our mission just changed, Professor. Everyone, prepare for battle!

@Opening 
Your house must help the Knights of Seiros suppress Lord Lonato's rebellion at Castle Gaspard. Though you are told not to expect combat, the deep fog at Magdred Way sets you ill at ease...

@Battle 
Catherine: With this fog, it's impossible to tell where the enemy might be...or how many of them there are. The enemy could be trying to surround us, but they shouldn't have enough soldiers to form a tight circle. Take down anyone who breaks through the fog, and let's push through!
^start
Edelgard: That smell... It's fresh blood. It seems the battle has already started within the fog.

Dimitri: Shouting from within the fog... It seems the knights are already battling.

Claude: The conditions are the same for both sides... But we're at a disadvantage for not knowing the terrain.
^end
Catherine: Proceed with caution! Wait for them to enter your field of view.

Narration: You can earn a reward if your allies do not suffer heavy losses. Be careful not to let your allies flee!

Militia:  Lord Lonato doesn't deserve such sadness and anger... Now it's your turn to suffer!
Ashe:   Why, Lonato? Why did you drag so many others into this?

Militia: You would think we're just gonna do nothing while you try to kill our lord?!

Narration: The fog is lifting as a result of the Dark Mage being defeated! It seems the fog was being caused by magic.

@Boss
Gaspard Commander: I won't let you anywhere near Lord Lonato!

@Cutscene 
Lonato:  It's you. Thunderstrike Cassandra! It was your wretched zealotry that killed my son!
Catherine:  The only name I answer to is "Catherine". Prepare to taste the blade of one who serves the goddess. Now you face a Knight of Seiros!

@Battle 
Lonato:  The fog has cleared. There's nothing left to hide you or the filthy Central Church from the judgement of the goddess!

Militia: Lord Lonato... Please, don't die...

Edelgard: I'm sorry, but I don't believe Lord Lonato has the strength to carry on.

Dimitri: I am sorry... But did you really think you would get away with this?

Claude:  The nobles start the war, but it's the commoners who spill their blood first...

@Boss 
Lonato:  You have been deceived by that witch... I will show you the truth!

%Catherine,Lonato
Lonato:  You! I will be the one to kill you, no other!
Catherine:  You have lost all sense of justice.  You want to fight me? So be it. I'll send you to meet your goddess.

%Ashe,Lonato
Lonato:  Stand down, Ashe. I must destroy these evil-doers by any means necessary!
Ashe:  Please surrender, Lonato! Whatever your reason for doing this, we can still talk it out!
Lonato:  Rhea is an infidel who has deceived the people and desecrated the goddess! We have virtue and the goddess herself on our side!
Ashe:  Even if all that's true, dragging the townsfolk into it like this isn't right!
Lonato:  Enough. If that is how you feel, prepare yourself! I'm putting an end to this!

%Dimitri,Lonato
Lonato: I apologize, Your Highness. It is regrettable that we should cross swords like this.
Dimitri: Lonato, I sympathize with your position. I really do. I have no wish to kill you, but I am afraid you have left me no choice. Please...forgive me.
Lonato: Your Highness... I cannot stop here. For my child, and for the people of FÃ³dlan. If you will not stand aside, then I have no choice but to cut you down.

@End 
Lonato:   That vile woman... Christophe... Forgive me...
Ashe:   Lonato, I...
Catherine:  I never thought I'd see Lonato meet this fate.  Well done, everyone. Let's gather our troops and go.

^start 
Caspar: Damn it! It was all so pointless. I've never seen so many people utterly heartbroken...
Ferdinand: Forcing innocent citizens to risk their lives... That man was not a noble, but a monster.
Hubert: What could have pushed Lord Lonato to this point?
Edelgard: Everyone was a bit shaken by the militia fighting alongside our enemies.
Byleth: No use dwelling on it.
Byleth: That is the reality of battle.
Edelgard: If only everyone could face reality so unflinchingly. The commoners who allied themselves with Lord Lonato believed they were fighting for a just cause. It would be disrespectful to consider them simply victims when they died for what they believed in. Still, we have no choice but to eliminate those who cling to unreasonable ideas of justice. Even if our enemies are the gods themselves...we must never lose sight of our goal.
Byleth: That's taking it a bit far.
Edelgard: Is it? Such a day may come, whether you expect it or not. You should be ready.
Byleth: Agreed. 
Edelgard: I'm surprised to hear you say that.
Edelgard: Really, I'm just like Lonato. I, too, will be the sort of ruler who's willing to risk the lives of my citizens in service of a higher cause. It's not possible to change the world without sacrifice. Dying for the greater good is not a death in vain.
Catherine: Professor... I'm afraid this incident is far more serious than anticipated.

Ashe: Why... Why did this happen? Lonato was always such a kind man... Everyone in the village was...was so nice to me. And I...I killed them. I killed them all! I had to, I know I had to... I know that! But still... What does that make me?
Dimitri: Please, don't beat yourself up, Ashe. We did what had to be done.
Ashe: I'm...I'm sorry. I shouldn't be bothering you. I'm...I'm going to check on the town. I hope my brother and sister are OK. 
Dimitri: That...that was my first time killing civilians too... Those who I'm sworn to protect.
Byleth: It was a necessary sacrifice.
Byleth: That is the reality of war.
Dimitri: Are you insane?! Those weren't knights or soldiers, but fathers and sons! We...we shouldn't have killed them. We should have found another way... I...I'm sorry. It's not fair for me to blame you for the circumstance. I know that if we hadn't...done what we did, even more civilian lives would have been lost. At least, my mind understands that. But...my heart... Professor... Those in power, no matter the era, always claim they fight for a just cause. That they take life to protect it. But... Is it truly OK to take any life you please, all in service of some implacable "just cause"? Lord Lonato didn't take up arms out of a lust for power. He simply believed his cause to be just. Who's to say it wasn't? Maybe we didn't have to cut him down like that. Maybe we could have reached a mutual understanding...found a path of peace. I...I have to believe that. Perhaps the notion sounds laughable to you. Mere lip service to naive ideals. But I can't believe otherwise.
Catherine: Sorry to intrude, but this incident may be more serious than anticipated.

Claude: Nice work, Teach. Still...that fight left a foul taste in my mouth. That aside, did you see how Catherine fought?
Byleth: She's incredible.
Claude: Agreed. I thought the power of the Heroes' Relics must be exaggerated, but I was clearly wrong.
Byleth: I'm stronger.
Claude: Ha! I love the confidence, Teach. But you're no match for the Heroes' Relics. They're on a whole different level.
Claude: Makes you wonder about that legend...
Byleth: What legend?
Claude: Oh, it's nothing. Just the usual fanciful nonsense. An ancient Relic that once cut a mountain in half with a single swing. That's what they say, anyway. But as amazing as Thunderbrand is, I don't think it fits that description. Apparently, Relics can harness tremendous power for those with a compatible Crest. Though you can technically use one so long as you have any Crest at all. I dunno. Long story short, I'd like to try cutting a mountain in half someday.
Hilda: Ooh! Are you talking about Relics? You'll be able to wield one soon, Claude! I just know it! After all, you've already been selected as the next head of House Riegan!
Claude: Easy there, Hilda. I don't know how apt "soon" is. My grandfather is still unbearably healthy. Oh? Is this news to you, Teach? Yours truly was recently recognized as a legitimate child of House Riegan. They possess one of the Heroes' Relics too, though I've yet to see it.
Byleth: Just recently?
Claude: I officially joined House Riegan only last year. Before then, I lived with my father.
Byleth: You haven't seen it?
Claude: I was raised by my father. House Riegan is on my mother's side of the family.
Claude: When I learned that my mother was the daughter of an Alliance noble, I was so surprised I thought the whole world was pulling a fast one on me for a week.
Hilda: So that means your mother is Duke Riegan's daughter, right? Where is she now?
Claude: I can't say. My mother's currently living in a different world than the one she grew up in and has no desire to return home.
Hilda: Um, OK. You sure have a lot of secrets, don't you?
Claude: I'm just keeping a promise to my parents. Make of that whatever you will. In exchange for my so-called secrecy, I'm free to do as I please, which is why I decided to see what the other side of my family was like. That's how I found out about this strange Crest I bear...
Leonie: Professor, Claude. It sounds like the troops will be withdrawing soon. We should return as well.
Ignatz: We won. We should be celebrating. Instead, we're heading back with heavy hearts...
Claude: Whoa there! What's the matter? You look as sad as a kitten without any yarn. If we hadn't done what we did, the rebel army would have followed this road all the way to the monastery. And they would have crushed all the little villages along the way. We stopped that from happening. You should be proud.
Catherine: Sorry to intrude, but this incident may be more serious than anticipated.
^end
Catherine: I found this on Lord Lonato. It's a note that mentions a plan to assassinate Lady Rhea. We can't tell who sent it, so the source is suspect, but the content is too disturbing to ignore. We must report this to Lady Rhea right away. I hope that it's nothing...

Rhea: I am glad to see that you have returned safely. The goddess is gracious with her divine protection. But it was not only her divine protection that shielded you, was it? You are just as skilled as I had hoped.
Byleth: My students deserve the praise.
Rhea: I am not so sure.
Byleth: I still have much to learn.
Rhea: There is no need for modesty.
Rhea: I heard some of the students were...hesitant about fighting militia. However, we must punish any sinner who may inflict harm upon believers, even if those sinners are civilians. I pray the students learned a valuable lesson about the fate that awaits all who are foolish enough to point their blades towards the heavens.
Seteth: Our real concern is what Catherine reported. The secret message that was in Lord Lonato's possession. It contained a deplorable plot to target the archbishop on the day of the Goddess's Rite of Rebirth. The plan seems unrealistic at best, but a threat is a threat. We must maintain constant vigilance. To that end, I would like for you and your students to help with security on the day of the ritual.
Byleth: You can count on us.
Rhea: That is most reassuring. You have my gratitude.
Byleth: We won't let her down. 
Rhea: That is most reassuring. You have my gratitude.
Byleth: Won't that endanger the students?
Rhea: Even if they encounter an enemy whom they cannot best, they should be fine so long as they have you on their side.
Seteth: The Rite of Rebirth is of paramount importance. It is when the Church of Seiros and its believers unite to pray for the return of the goddess. The archbishop and I will be confined to the Goddess Tower once the ritual begins. Of course, the knights will be on high alert as well, but there aren't enough of them to keep watch on every corner of the monastery. It is far from ideal to be forced to mobilize students, but the gravity of this situation requires that we all bend to avoid breaking.
Rhea: While there is no need to fear for my safety, we cannot turn a blind eye to those who would blaspheme so heinously.
Seteth: With any luck, this will all be for naught. Still, be on your guard.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Long ago, the guardian Seiros made an appearance during this moon. She had been summoned by the goddess, whose soul was suffering as the flames of war raged across FÃ³dlan. Some believe that high in the sky above Seiros, the Immaculate One's mighty wings are what powered the strong winds carrying the guardian and her forces into battle.

@Dialogue 
Edelgard: You're here again... Professor... You've been crying. So even you cry sometimes. Oh... I suppose that was thoughtless of me to say.
Byleth: Yes, it was.
Edelgard: Long ago, someone said the same to me.
Byleth: It's fine. 
Edelgard: My teacher. You're so blinded by grief that you can't see what's going on right in front of you.
Edelgard: Are you waiting for time to heal your wounds? Or have you curled up in a corner and lost the will to carry on?
Byleth: Does it matter?
Edelgard: It does. You've lost yourself.
Byleth: How could you ask me something like that?
Edelgard: It's not like you to speak to me like that. You know I'd never ask you a question without purpose.
Edelgard: Only you can truly understand your own sadness. Others can sympathize or even empathize, but all anyone else can offer are the tears of an outsider looking in. So I have no intention of crying for you, or of standing still with you. All I can do is promise to reach out my hand when the time comes for me to move forward.
Byleth: What do you mean?
Edelgard: The mysterious organization that was carrying out experiments in Remire Village and the chapel... They're up to something near Garreg Mach. The archbishop has sent the knights to undertake a large-scale investigation. No information has surfaced yet, but our enemies will soon be discovered. When they are, will you lead us into battle? Or will you just sit here with no thought for the future that is fast approaching? My teacher... There is a choice to be made. I hope you make the right one.

Sothis: My, my. She really is quite arrogant. She spoke her mind without an ounce of reservation! But she is right. The time has come to stand again. You already know what your answer is.

Monica: Oh, thank you. You saved me!
Thales: If you were to die, then the mystery of our bodies would be revealed. Preventing that was my only aim. I'm afraid you must remain, Kronya. There is something I need you to do.
Monica: Oh, of course. I am always happy to cooperate with Solon. Leave it to me.
Flame Emperor: How annoying.
Thales: Flame Emperor... Is she offending you? Unfortunately, we cannot take our eyes off her, so there is nothing to be done. You are our greatest creation. We used the defiled beast's blood as the fuel to your flame, that you may burn even the gods. Now is the time to cleanse FÃ³dlan of that power, and bring forth our salvation.
Flame Emperor: There will be no salvation for you and your kind. Those responsible for such gruesome deeds in Duscur and Enbarr.
Thales: All so that you may acquire the strength you need. All for a purpose...

Sothis: What are you going at this hour? Ooh, I know... You are eavesdropping! I must admit that I approve.

Dimitri: Professor? We must remain quiet...
Sothis: I see... The Flame Emperor and Monica...and the mage who rescued Monica.
Byleth: It's time for revenge. 
Dimitri: Not yet, Professor.
Byleth: What is that guy's name?
Dimitri: I don't know, but if we keep listening, we might be able to find out.
Sothis: An unexpected change to hear their plans! Patience, patience!

Monica: Oh, thank you. You saved me!
Thales: If you were to die, then the mystery of our bodies would be revealed. Preventing that was my only aim. I'm afraid you must remain, Kronya. There is something I need you to do.
Monica: Oh, of course. I am always happy to cooperate with Solon. Leave it to me.
Flame Emperor: How annoying.
Thales: Flame Emperor... Is she offending you? Unfortunately, we cannot take our eyes off her, so there is nothing to be done. You are our greatest creation. We used the defiled beast's blood as the fuel to your flame, that you may burn even the gods. Now is the time to cleanse FÃ³dlan of that power, and bring forth our salvation.
Flame Emperor: There will be no salvation for you and your kind. Those responsible for such gruesome deeds in Duscur and Enbarr.
Thales: All so that you may acquire the strength you need. All for a purpose...
Dimitri: I've got you... Finally...
Byleth: Wait.
Byleth: Don't go out there.
Byleth: Let's keep listening.
Dimitri: If we don't act now, we'll miss our chance!
Flame Emperor:  Hmm...
Thales: Hmph. Even if someone has overhead us, there is nothing they can do. There have always been rats in the walls, and there always will be.
Flame Emperor: ...

Dimitri: No... The dagger...
Byleth: What's wrong?
Byleth: What about the dagger?
Dimitri: It...no. Never mind. It couldn't possibly be so. Professor, those are the ones we must destroy. They're the bastards who killed my family and Jeralt. For now, let's return to the monastery and regroup. As for the Flame Emperor's dagger...I'll hold on to it for the time being.

Sothis: Day 5 of the Garland Moon. I picked some flowers for her and returned home. The look of joy on her face at the sight of these flowers will be even more beautiful than the flowers themselves... Yeesh! That is enough. His entries from before your birth are full of such romantic blatherings as that. Oh... It must be deeply moving you to hear such things, but now is not the time for whimsy. Someone is here. You do not wish for them to see you in this state. So pull yourself together!

Claude: I thought I might find you here, Teach. Not the type to wallow in solitude, eh? That's a relief, let me tell you. So... What were you reading? Is that Jeralt's...
Byleth: Diary.
Claude: So it is.
Byleth: Love letter.
Claude: The contents are certainly bittersweet... But I think it's Jeralt's diary.
Claude: Hey, maybe this has some entries from when Jeralt left the monastery.
Claude: Is that so... He was the captain of the knights, but something made him leave the monastery in a hurry. If it has something to do with your birth, knowing what happened may get us closer to knowing what secrets the church is hiding... Teach... Would you mind letting me read that diary? I know how important it is to you, but I'm not asking lightly. Please, allow me to borrow it.
Byleth: You may borrow it.
Claude: I'm forever in your debt, Teach. If you'd refused, I would've had to sneak in here in the dead of night. I wasn't looking forward to that prospect. Anyway, let me fill you in on what's been going on lately, and not just as thanks for pointing me to that diary.
Byleth: I can't allow it.
Claude: Wait, are you really saying I'm going to have to sneak in here in the dead of night to read it? I know how important it is to you, but I'm not asking lightly. Please, allow me to borrow it. 
Claude: Rhea dispatched the knights to various locations in a frantic search for the enemy. There's a rumor that she's already secured some information. Something big is gonna happen soon. That has me wondering... If you find out where the enemy is, what will you do about it? If you ask, I... No, scratch that. All of us students would gladly lend a hand. Even if it means going against Rhea's wishes. Don't forget it. Now go. Everyone's worried about you. You'd better show them you're in good spirits.

@Conversation 
Sothis: If you must weep, then weep. I shall be here for you.
Byleth: Thank you.
Sothis: Well, it would be ridiculous not to feel anything after something like that. Go on and let it out. I am here. 
Byleth: That won't be necessary.
Sothis: Are you already past it? You are unflappable. I will give you that much. In that case, I will remain silently supportive. You are right that we must keep moving ever onward.

Edelgard: Professor, I'm so happy to see you. You're finally returning to your old self. To see the light in your eyes again is a gift. It inspires me to carry on as well. As you know, the knights are searching furiously for any trace of the enemies who escaped. I'll inform you immediately if I learn anything relevant.



Edelgard: What happened to Jeralt... It's terrible. If there's anything I can do, simply ask. Even if what you desire is revenge...I'll gladly lend you my power. We can't let them get away with this.




Dimitri: Professor! Welcome back... I was... We all were...  You've been on our minds. Know that your enemies are my enemies. I will do all I can to help you find justice. There is no one else I can... My strength is yours alone. I will fight as you command... I will kill anyone should you ask it of me.



Dimitri: I'm so sorry about what happened to Jeralt... No...of course my sorrow is nothing compared to yours. The knights are even now searching for our enemies' whereabouts. They are to report back the moment they find something. If you desire revenge, Professor...you can count me in.




Claude: Hi, Teach. I see the storm in your eyes has passed... You're looking much better. I've been reading Jeralt's diary. The baby he mentions... That's you, isn't it? I can't understand about half of what's written on here... But Jeralt really cherished you. That much is clear.



Claude: I haven't lost a parent yet, so I can't even begin to understand how you must be feeling... But even while you're standing still, the world keeps on moving. I always find that oddly comforting.




Hubert: I've never been much for condolences. How about a little logic, instead? The knights have spread out around Garreg Mach in search of Jeralt's murderers. Thus, the monastery's fighting strength is, for the moment at least, depleted. Perhaps that was the enemy's real objective. We should be prepared for further confrontation.

Hubert: I've never been much for condolences.

Petra: Professor, please lend us your ears. Ferdinand is saying impossible things.
Ferdinand: I do not see what is impossible about it. All I said was that if you want to go back to Brigid, you probably can. You are...the Empire's guest, so to speak. They cannot afford for something bad to happen to you. There would be a diplomatic incident. Someone close to us has turned up dead, so one could argue that you're not safe here anymore.
Petra: You were already told! I am learning here, from the academy. What are you thinking, Professor?
Byleth: You do not have to leave if you do not wish it. 
Byleth: You may return home if you please. 
Petra: I am not returning to home until I have grabbed my goal! I will not be listening to the words of Ferdinand.
Ferdinand: No, look, I did not mean to pressure you. Apologies for the misunderstanding.



Linhardt: I slipped quietly into the vault and rummaged about, looking for anything we might find useful. There is a group of people who want to kill us, after all. What? This is no time for asking permission. I learned long ago that one can ask permission or forgiveness. It is rarely useful to request the former. Still, it appears that the knights have already taken everything useful. There were Crest-related objects I thought might be worth studying, soâ There you go again with that stern look. Of course I'll put them back when I'm done. Assuming they bear no additional use.



Caspar: I'm not even close to being strong enough. I mean, Jeralt was so much stronger than me, but even he... That's enough. I can't dwell on the past. There's no way to know what my future holds but I do know one thing. Whatever happens, I have to make my own way in this world. I have to keep pushing so I can grow even stronger!



Bernadetta: Professor? I, um, I brought some flowers for Jeralt.
Byleth: Thank you. 
Bernadetta: It's the least I can do. Sometimes I feel like all I do is run away...
Byleth: You're out of your room...
Bernadetta: Hey! Sometimes I go out for, uh...walks...
Bernadetta: Anyway, I'll go lay them out.



Dorothea: I've sung lyrics lamenting death many times on stage... But when something like this happens in real life... I'm lost. I don't know what to say. But I do know this much... Sir Jeralt must have been very proud to have you as his child.



Dedue: It is a shame what happened to Jeralt. I am sorry. There are no words. Leave some flowers on his grave for me.

Sylvain: Dark expressions don't suit you, Professor. But I'm... Well, I'm glad to see you out in the world again. It seems this month will be a quiet one around here. There aren't many knights around to liven things up.
Felix: Most of the knights are gone, seeking out the enemy.
Sylvain: Isn't that a bit much? I agree it's important, but is it a good idea to neglect the safety of the monastery?
Felix: What do you think, Professor?
Byleth: It would be a shame if we were invaded. 
Felix: I agree. We can send some knights after our enemies, but so many? It makes the church seem reckless.
Byleth: You're worrying too much.
Sylvain: Hopefully the knights finish their business and hurry back. I wouldn't mind having a few extra lances around.



Ashe: Not just Tomas, but Monica too. We can't be sure who to trust anymore, can we? Who are these people, really? What do they want?

Mercedes: I'm so glad you're OK, Professor. I was so worried!
Annette: Oh, Professor! You must be starving. Mercie and I made some sweets for you. We were thinking that if you were to eat something sweet, it might help you feel better.
Byleth: Thank you for the thought. 
Mercedes: Baking sweets is my specialty. I'm sure they'll do the trick.
Byleth: I'm fine. 
Annette: Well, of course you are! And if you have sweets you'll be even more fine.



Ingrid: I'm so sorry... I never quite know what to say at times like these... Just...don't push yourself too hard too soon. It's OK to allow yourself to be sad right now. Losing someone dear to you... Well, each loss is unique, but it's a feeling I know very well. That said... Professor, I...



Lorenz: There is no one here who has not heard tales of Jeralt's valor. We have suffered a most dear loss. I do not know what the enemy's aim was, but I do know thisâafter what they have done, we cannot suffer them to live. If there is anything I can do to ensure that justice is brought swiftly, you need only give the word.



Raphael: You've gotta keep yourself active during tough times, Professor. Even if it seems impossible. That's how I got through when I lost my parents. If you need help with anything, just come and see me. Eating and training are my specialties.



Ignatz: I'm scared. I feel that I don't understand the world. How could something like that happen to Jeralt? He was so strong.
Byleth: Even though you're scared, push through. 
Ignatz: You're inspiring, Professor. Ill do my best.
Byleth: What happens, happens.
Ignatz: I suppose, but... Please, take care, Professor! We can't afford to lose you too.



Lysithea: I'm sure you will pull through this because you're so strong, Professor. Best to stay calm during such tumultuous and upsetting times. We don't know the nature of our enemies. If we underestimate them, anything could happen.
Byleth: But if we don't defeat them...
Lysithea: I agree they must be defeated, but I also feel we must approach this with prudence.
Byleth: We should be careful. 
Lysithea: Yes, I agree. I...don't want to lose you too, Professor.

Hilda: Professor! People are saying horrible things about Marianne. They're saying she's friends with the bad guys. If I hear someone say that, I'll...
Marianne: Leave it alone, Hilda. It doesn't matter.
Byleth: Just ignore it. 
Marianne: Of course. Thank you, Professor.
Byleth: We'll defeat the bad guys. We'll show them. 
Hilda: That would be the quickest way to resolve this. Come on Marianne, let's give it our all.




Marianne: I'll say a prayer for Jeralt's soul. There's not much else I can do...




Hilda: Professor, it seems like you're holding up OK, but... I'm worried about Leonie. She really loved Jeralt. I hope she can bounce back...



Leonie: Captain Jeralt's gone. He's gone. And we'd only just reunited... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sure this is even harder on you. But I just can'tâ I can't believe...



Rhea: Professor... How are you holding up? I know how heavily grief weighs upon one's heart... I lost my mother some time ago. It was... Forgive me my moment of weakness. Even all these years later, I cannot recall that time without feeling the pain as if it were brand new. Just know that I am praying for your mind and your heart to find peace.



Seteth: First Tomas, and now Monica. I do have a theory, though I admit it is nothing more than speculation. Both Tomas and Monica have each gone missing at one time or another. It was reported that when Monica returned from her disappearance, she began to act like a completely different person. As if, perhaps, the real Monica had been killed and replaced by an impostor. Thinking of it like that, it is possible that this Solon had been impersonating Tomas for some time. How they managed such a convincing change of appearance, though, I still do not understand.



Flayn: You have lost your father... Now more than ever do I understand how very lucky I am that you were able to save me. Professor, I deeply appreciate what you have done. Thank you. If there is anything at all I can do in return, please tell me, OK?



Hanneman: You've lost someone very dear to you... I'm so... You have my sympathy. Manuela and I can take on some of your workload this month. We can't do all the teaching, but at least we can lighten the load for you. I've always seen strength in your eyes. I know you'll recover. You're a very strong person.



Manuela: I have something rather uncomfortable to discuss. It's about the weapon that killed Jeralt. Will you listen?
Byleth: I'll listen. 
Manuela: It was a dagger, but I know enough to know it wasn't an ordinary dagger. It wasn't made of iron or steel because... Well, because whatever it was, the wound it left wasn't normal. Who could make a blade like that, do you figure?
Byleth: I won't listen.
Manuela: I see... That's probably for the best.


Manuela: I wonder who they were...



Cyril: Oh Goddess, hear my prayer. Please receive this beloved person. When the cold rain washes the body, when the bird and wolf announce the dawn... Receive them into your blue blood. Receive them into a twinkling star. That's a mourning scripture from the Church of Seiros. Lady Rhea taught it to me. I pray that Jeralt is happy in the next world.



Anna: I heard Jeralt passed away... My deepest condolences. I knew him long before I ever even met you... He was always so much fun to be around... It's such a loss...

Gatekeeper: Professor... Thank you for all you have done for us. Nothing to report today. *sobs*

@Intro 
^start
Edelgard: Professor! I know where the enemy is... Where Solon is. They're in a place called the Sealed Forest, close to the monastery. The archbishop is gathering the knights to begin a search. She's doing so in secret, behind our backs.
Byleth: Why in secret?
Edelgard: She must be afraid that a thirst for revenge will compel you to seek them out. Now that you know, will you give us the order?
Rhea: No. I will not allow it.
Seteth: This discovery comes just when the knights are at their busiest. It is all too likely that our foes revealed themselves to lure you out there. They are the ones who took Jeralt from you... I know how you must despise them, but I must ask you to rein in your personal feelings for now.
Byleth: You can't stop me.
Rhea: Please, Professor. Do not act carelessly. I ask that you leave this to us. Losing you so soon after losing Jeralt would be unbearable.
Edelgard: Lady Rhea, our professor is not acting out of revenge. Sending us out there is the most strategic move we can make. You can't deny it. Most of the knights are still far away. Not only does our professor wield a Hero's Relic, but there is no one here who is more powerful. Seteth and the few remaining knights can't leave the monastery unattended. We have fought under our teacher's command countless times. We are the most effective army here, and we are already prepared for battle. We have no idea what the enemy is plotting. We must act now!
Rhea: Professor... Do you agree with this strategy?
Rhea: Understood. I will give you the order. Destroy the enemy that is hiding in the Sealed Forest... You have the protection of the goddess on your side. Whatever happens, you shall overcome.
Edelgard: Let's go, my teacher. Whatever happens, do not lose your conviction out there.

Dimitri: Professor, have you heard? They say we've finally located the enemy. It seems they're hiding in the sealed forest, right near the monastery. Lady Rhea has summoned all of the knights to return and take them down. And all of this is being done in secret. Why? To keep us...no, to keep you in the dark.
Byleth: Why the secrecy?
Dimitri: Lady Rhea likely assumed you wouldn't be able to stop yourself from confronting the enemy if you knew their location. But that is not how this story ends, is it? Professor... We're at the ready. Order us to depart, and we'll fight at your side.
Rhea: No. I will not allow it.
Seteth: This discovery comes just when the knights are at their busiest. It is all too likely that our foes revealed themselves to lure you out there. They are the ones who took Jeralt from you... I know how you must despise them, but I must ask you to rein in your personal feelings for now.
Byleth: You can't stop me.
Rhea: Please, Professor. Do not act carelessly. I ask that you leave this to us. Losing you so soon after losing Jeralt would be unbearable.
Dimitri: Lady Rhea, Seteth. Please, try to understand our reasoning before you refuse. With most of the knights still far away, we cannot afford for you two to leave the monastery undefended. The enemy's strength is yet unknown. The only warriors who likely stand a chance are those who wield Relics. With all that in mind, it's obvious who should be dispatched, is it not? If the professor leaves, we will go as well. We've already made preparations and are ready to depart at a moment's notice. Surely you must see that we cannot wait any longer for the knights to gather. Please... Do what must be done and give us the order.
Rhea: Professor... Do you agree with this strategy?
Rhea: Understood. I will give you the order. Destroy the enemy that is hiding in the Sealed Forest... You have the protection of the goddess on your side. Whatever happens, you shall overcome.
Dimitri: No matter what enemy we face, we will not fail. I promise you that.

Claude: Teach! Tomas... I mean...Solon and his lackeys. Their whereabouts have been discovered. Apparently they're lurking in the Sealed Forest, not too far from the monastery. Rhea has called back all of the knights who were out searching to round them up. Seems like it could take some time for them to make it back here...but she didn't ask for our help.
Byleth: Why keep it a secret?
Claude: Perhaps to prevent you from running headfirst toward revenge? It's only natural that you would leap at the chance for it. Anyone would.
Rhea: No. I will not allow it.
Seteth: This discovery comes just when the knights are at their busiest. It is all too likely that our foes revealed themselves to lure you out there. They are the ones who took Jeralt from you... I know how you must despise them, but I must ask you to rein in your personal feelings for now.
Byleth: You can't stop me.
Rhea: Please, Professor. Do not act carelessly. I ask that you leave this to us. Losing you so soon after losing Jeralt would be unbearable.
Claude: Listen, Rhea. Erm, Lady Rhea. This move is the most strategic. The military strategy I'm devising will soon echo across FÃ³dlan's history. I'm sure of it. Just think about it. Most of the knights are still far away, and we can't afford to have Seteth and friends abandon the monastery. So the only person who can take action now also happens to be our best commander. It's Teach, and wherever Teach leads, we'll follow. And since you've taught us that this sort of thing is always a possibility, we're already prepared for battle. We can buy the knights more time. Not for revenge, but for a defensive attack on behalf of the monastery.
Rhea: Professor... Do you agree with this strategy?
Rhea: Understood. I will give you the order. Destroy the enemy that is hiding in the Sealed Forest... You have the protection of the goddess on your side. Whatever happens, you shall overcome.
Claude: We have our orders, Teach. Now all that's left is to pull out a miracle.

@Intro 
^start 
Hubert: We are now within the Sealed Forest. We must not let our guard down.
Bernadetta: Professor... We'll avenge Jeralt for you, no matter what!
Ferdinand: Remember--it is a bad idea to get distracted by revenge.
Petra: I have readiness. Our enemies will be taking...we will take our enemies down!
Linhardt: Well, it's not like we have any other missions this month. I suppose this is as good a way as any to spend our energy.
Caspar: Linhardt spending energy? We had better finish this fast before the pigs start flying everywhere.
Dorothea: Lower your voice. The enemy could be close!
Flayn: It is time to repay the kindness of the professor who saved my life!
Edelgard: Professor, I know I'm the one who insisted we come here, but don't doubt for a moment that the enemy is waiting for you.
Hubert: Lady Edelgard! What are you saying?
Edelgard: What other objective could they possibly have? We have no clue what kind of trap is waiting for us. Please be careful, my teacher. We can't afford to lose you...
Hubert: The enemy is strong, but you will prevail. You must.

Dedue: The Sealed Forest is up ahead. Stay alert.
Ingrid: This is for Captain Jeralt. I will not falter.
Flayn: It is time to repay the kindness of the professor who saved my life!
Ashe: Leave it to us, Professor. I'll give it my all.
Sylvain: Fighting Tomas... It will be difficult, that's for certain.
Mercedes: I don't really love the idea of fighting people I know...
Annette: We don't have a choice. Even if it's difficult, an enemy is an enemy. We've just got to get it over with!
Felix: Just kill them from behind. As long as you don't see their faces, you won't know if you know them.
Dimitri: We won't know unless we see their face... Yes, I suppose that is true. Professor... I hope you know I meant what I told you before. Your enemy is my enemy. And I will follow you until the end, whatever that end may be.
Byleth: That's reassuring.
Byleth: Let's do our best.
Dimitri: Yes...right. We'll fulfill our duty together. We've come this far. We can't stop now. I hope you know that you can rely on us. No matter who the enemy is, we are prepared to cut them down.
Dimitri: Yes... No matter who they may be...

Claude: The Sealed Forest is up ahead. Visibility is awful there, so everyone needs to be extra cautious.
Hilda: You seem to know a lot about it. It is just a forest, isn't it?
Claude: Have you been there too? Oh... Never mind. Listen, just like I told the archbishop, this is not a war of vengeance. It's a riddle, so to speak. Those guys are undoubtedly planning something terrible. We need some kind of clue as to what. The attack on the Holy Mausoleum. That foul business in Remire. The Demonic Beasts at the chapel... It can't go on. We need to figure out their objective and stop them from achieving it. That's our mission.
Lorenz: So, we have our mission now. We had better not fail.
Lysithea: It is a difficult task, but we will succeed.
Flayn: It is time to repay the kindness of the professor who saved my life!
Ignatz: An enemy whose objective you don't understand is a frightening prospect.
Raphael: We're gonna destroy 'em! It's our mission!
Leonie: I will have my revenge, whatever it takes. On that, I will never budge.
Marianne: Leonie... You will have what you seek.
Claude: I'll admit, vengeance sounds pretty nice. But don't forget that we're here for information. Luckily, we can easily find what we're looking for while getting revenge for Jeralt. Right, Teach?
^end

@Opening 
In the pursuit of justice for Jeralt, you and your students find yourselves deep in the Sealed Forest.

@Battle
Edelgard: Look there! Demonic Beasts! I suppose they aren't holding back.

Dimitri: Demonic Beasts! The enemy was always intending to lure us here...

Claude: How kind of them to welcome us with Demonic Beasts. They're not playing around.

Monica: Hello! You're here! Welcome to the forest of death! My name is Kronya. This weakling girl was just a borrowed look for me.

Kronya: This is what I really look like! Now, you vermin... I'll take down every last one of you!


Kronya: If this takes too long, I might be forced to escape. Oh, or do you simply intend to let me go? How accommodating of you! As for me, I intend to kill you all. 

@Boss 
Kronya: How cute, you're trying so hard! But now it's time to die!

%Byleth,Kronya
Kronya: You're a fool to be so brazen. You'll never avenge your father at this rate. I'll have to kill you too! With my own hands!

%Edelgard,Kronya
Kronya: Huh? What are you-- Are you here to kill me?
Edelgard: I am. Prepare yourself for death while you still can.

%Leonie,Kronya
Leonie: Monica. You'll pay for what you've done.
Kronya: I told you! I am not Monica, I am Kronya! Do not call me by that fake name!
Leonie: I don't care what you're called. I don't care if it takes my last breath. I'll kill you.
Kronya: Please! My powers are beyond your comprehension. You're just a filthy worm!

@Cutscene 
Kronya: But how? How could I really lose...to a lowly creature like you?
Solon: Well.
Kronya: Solon! Don't just stand there and stare! I need your help!
Solon: Yes. You most certainly do.
Kronya: Huh?
Solon: Have no fear, Kronya. Your sacrifice will help to rid of this world of the filthy vermin that have long infested it.
Kronya: Solon... Stop this!
Solon: The time has finally come...to unleash the Forbidden Spell of Zahras upon our enemies!
Kronya: Please...help me...
Solon: Begone with you...Fell Star.

@Battle
^start
Edelgard: That could only have been magic! What happened to our professor?
Solon: They were swallowed by the mystical darkness of the forbidden spell. An eternity wandering in a void of darkness, never to return to this world... To think we almost had the Sword of the Creator...
Caspar: You're lying! Our professor is alive, I know it!
Flayn: That's right! Our professor is no ordinary human!
Hubert: It is hard to fathom that our professor would die in a place like this.
Solon: It is possible that death has yet to find your friend. But there are worse things than death. Drifting through the darkness with no chance to escape... Overwhelmed with hopelessness... It must be torturous.
Edelgard: You're already boasting a victory, but know this--if you did use such devious tricks to stop our professor... I swear that you will regret it.
Ferdinand: I cannot help but agree with her this once. Even if our professor is trapped in darkness, that is not the end of their story.
Solon: I will not forgive such arrogance. If you prefer it so, you shall also be added to the ranks of the dead!

Dimitri: What was that sorcery? What happened to our professor?!
Solon: They were swallowed by the mystical darkness of the forbidden spell. An eternity wandering in a void of darkness, never to return to this world... To think we almost had the Sword of the Creator...
Annette: That's a lie! There's no way the professor is really dead!
Flayn: That's right! Our professor is no ordinary human!
Dedue: I do not believe our professor has fallen.
Solon: It is possible that death has yet to find your friend. But there are worse things than death. Drifting through the darkness with no chance to escape...Overwhelmed with hopelessness... It must be torturous.
Dedue: We cannot abandon hope, Your Highness. Our professor lives. I know it.
Dimitri: You're right. We will save the professor. But first, let's destroy this fiend! I'll slice you into a thousand pieces as we watch with horror... You will know true pain before I finally allow you to die!
Solon: How trite. But if you wish for pain, I shall oblige. If you prefer it so, you shall also be added to the ranks of the dead!

Hilda: Wh-what was that? Where did you go, Professor?!
Solon: They were swallowed by the mystical darkness of the forbidden spell. An eternity wandering in a void of darkness, never to return to this world... To think we almost had the Sword of the Creator...
Lysithea: I don't believe anything you say! Our professor is still alive!
Flayn: That's right! Our professor is no ordinary human!
Claude: I refuse to believe that Teach would die in a place like this!
Solon: It is possible that death has yet to find your friend. But there are worse things than death. Drifting through the darkness with no chance to escape...Overwhelmed with hopelessness... It must be torturous.
Claude: Hey, all I hear is good news. Teach is still alive. And if that's true, then there's only one thing to do. Defeat you while we wait for Teach's triumphant return!
Leonie: Prepare yourself. We will avenge our leader here and now!
Solon: How trite. But if you wish for pain, I shall oblige. If you prefer it so, you shall also be added to the ranks of the dead!

@Battle 
Byleth: ...
Sothis: You fool!
Sothis: What were you thinking, charging right into an enemy's trap? Are you just a boulder that rolls down whatever hill it's on? No, even a boulder has more sense!
Byleth: I'm sorry.
Sothis: Apologizing won't make things right! This darkness is terrifying!
Byleth: I can explain...
Sothis: Excuses won't help us! This darkness is terrifying!
Sothis: As you and I are one... I, too, am trapped within this void. But please consider this... This realm of darkness we are in is seperate from the world from which you came. I mean that it would take a god to leave this place. In time, our hearts and minds will cease to be. Are you prepared to die?
Byleth: I am.
Sothis: How very brave of you, to joke at times like these...
Byleth: I am not.
Sothis: I thought as much. I also do not wish to die. And yet...
Sothis: There is no other choice...
Byleth: What choice?
Sothis: Do you recall your father's diary? He said you were a child who never cried nor laughed. I think I am the one to blame. I must have been asleep, but even then, I feel I was a part of you. I do not know how Rhea managed it, but she allowed me to exist inside of you. The truth is I have always been with you. It is within you that I found my power yet again. The power of a goddess. The power of the progenitor god.
Byleth: ...
Sothis: My name is Sothis. By now you must be well aware of what that means. I am the one who watches over FÃ³dlan and the creatures dwelling there. I am Sothis, she who died then returned.
Byleth: I can't believe it.
Byleth: Somehow, I know it to be true.
Sothis: There is only one thing left to do to save us from this darkness of eternity. I must now use the power of a god. However, I lack a body of my own. And so, I must relinquish all the power that I have...to you. The time has come for you and I to join as one. And when that comes to pass...then I shall disappear.
Byleth: Disappear?!
Byleth: I won't allow it.
Sothis: When I say disappear, I do not mean that all I am will be no more. My soul will join with yours, and you and I will never be apart. But...I will no longer have a chance to speak with you. I shall miss it. So long have I been on this path with you. Through you, I got to see and hear this world. I even got to chastise you from time to time. I may not have acted like a goddess, but...it was certainly fun. For all that you have done... Thank you. I'm glad that it was you to whom my fate was bound.
Byleth: Thank you...for everything.
Sothis: Now... We must pray. For if we share this wish, our spirits two will join as one... Your wish...is to return to the forest, stop the enemy, and rescue the little ones. No need for words. I know your heart as though it were my own...

@Cutscene 
Sothis: Your will and mine are now as one. Both sides of time are revealed to you, and you alone.

Sothis: You know I am the beginning. What shall you do?

Solon: So the Fell Star consumes even the darkness itself...

@Battle 
Edelgard: Professor... It is you, right? I knew that you would always come back to us. I'd like to ask about your appearance, but for now, let's dispose of our enemies.
Solon: What did you see in the darkness of Zahras? This should be impossible. The only being that can withstand that darkness is... Unless I dispose of you myself, I may never have the chance to send you back there!

Solon: But this is not the end... Thales will carry out our mission, somehow...
Edelgard: It's over. Now, Professor. About your appearance...

Dimitri: Professor... That is you, isn't it? I am glad you are safe. I was sure that you would return. Please tell me all that happened to you later. For now, it's imperative that we kill the demon!
Solon: What did you see in the darkness of Zahras? This should be impossible. The only being that can withstand that darkness is... Unless I dispose of you myself, I may never have the chance to send you back there!

Solon: But this is not the end... Thales will carry out our mission, somehow...
Dimitri: Thales... Does he also serve the Flame Emperor? It can't be...

Claude: Teach... You are Teach, right? I always believed in you... I knew you could cut your way out of anything.
Solon: What did you see in the darkness of Zahras? This should be impossible. The only being that can withstand that darkness is... Unless I dispose of you myself, I may never have the chance to send you back there!

Solon: But this is not the end... Thales will carry out our mission, somehow...
Claude: I guess this is still far from over...

@Boss 
Solon: I have no time to waste on the likes of you...

Solon: To think...that I would lose to mere beasts.

%Byleth,Solon
Solon: I am terrified by you... Even though an emotion like fear has no place inside me. That means you must be eliminated.

%Edelgard,Solon
Solon: So this is how it is... I cannot let you live!
Edelgard: You stole the words from my mouth. You lost the moment you failed to kill the professor.

@End 
^start
Edelgard: That hair...and those eyes... You remind me of someone. What happened to you?
Byleth: The goddess gifted me her power.
Edelgard: The goddess? I see... Well, I'm happy for you. Your weapon is called the Sword of the Creator, after all. It's no wonder she looks favorably upon you. Just as it was with saint Seiros, no doubt... And just how will you use this new power, Professor?
Byleth: For the people of the world.
Edelgard: Heh, that is so like you to say that.
Byleth: For my students.
Edelgard: For us? I see...
Byleth: For myself.
Edelgard: That is no answer. You must use your power for something greater than yourself.
Edelgard: Tell me... If the world, and your students included, were to divide and go to war with each other, what would you do? In that scenario, each side would represent both the world and your students. Who would you--
Edelgard: Professor? Have you...fallen asleep?! This must be a side effect of your recent...changes. I can't just leave you here...
Edelgard: I shouldn't ask Hubert to carry you, so I suppose it falls to me...

Dimitri: Professor... I'm glad you're OK. And you seem relatively unscathed. I'm...I'm so relieved. What's more, Jeralt's foe is dead. Though we took little satisfaction from it. Professor... I must ask. What happened after we were separated? You look...different.
Byleth: The goddess gifted me her power.
Dimitri: The goddess appeared...and gave you her power? It's as though...the legend of old has been made flesh. It's hard to grasp, in all honestly. But having seen you pierce the sky with my own eyes, I find myself unable to doubt it.
Byleth: A legend of old?
Dimitri: Yes. The legend of Saint Seiros. It is said that she received a divine revelation from the goddess and was gifted with her power. Long ago, the goddess dispatched Seiros to defeat an evil king who went mad with power. Perhaps the goddess saw the goodness of Seiros within you too, and wished to help you in your quest to defeat evil. Hm. If you're Seiros, granted power by the goddess, then I suppose that makes me... Ah, never mind. I'm getting carried away.
Dimitri: Professor! What's wrong?! Are you...uh... Are you asleep? What is happening these days? Well, it matters not. We must get you help, and fast.
Dimitri: Sorry, Professor, but I have no choice but to carry you back.

Claude: Teach! We won! I'll be honestâwhen I lost sight of you, I broke into a cold sweat. But Jeralt's killer is dead. All's well that ends well.
Byleth: That's true.
Byleth: True...
Claude: You're kidding, right? I understood putting it off while we were in battle, but now that it's over, just go ahead and spit it out. That hair. Those eyes. That unfathomable power. What happened out there?
Byleth: I will tell you...
Claude: You mean to tell me...that an entity who claims to be the goddess was living inside your mind? And it's been that way since you were a baby? And this goddess entrusted all of her goddess-like power to you and then vanished...
Claude: It's a difficult story to swallow, Teach. But the way you look now... I guess I've got no choice but to believe it. How could something like that happen? There must be a clue in Jeralt's diary. If you believe the diary, there's a high possibility that Rhea did something to you when you were born. That's likely when all this began. What in the world happened to you as a baby? And what was Rhea after?
Claude: Teach! What's the matter?! Did you trip or... Wait. Are you sleeping? This must be an effect of the goddess's power. I wonder if Teach's body can handle the strain...
Claude: Think, Claude. What now? Should I carry him on my back? Easier said than done...
^end

Rhea:  In time's flow...see the glow of flames ever burning bright... On the swift river's drift, broken memories alight...

Rhea: Professor. You must remain still.
Byleth: Where am I?
Byleth: What happened?
Rhea: Everything is all right. There is no need to worry. Those who are trying to harm you are far away.

Rhea: ... How lovely...it would be for this moment to last forever... I wish I could hold on to this time we have stolen... that you and I could create a world without end... I have heard whispers of what happened to you. Your appearance... You have received power from the goddess. From the moment you took hold of the Sword of the Creator... I prayed that one day the radiant power of Sothis, which bathes FÃ³dlan in its celestial light, might reside within you. But you are so much more than the light. You are my... Close your eyes, dear one. Sleep, just a while longer.

Rhea: I will be watching over you, always. Always and forever...

@Opening 
In honor of the saints whose births or deaths took place under this moon, the people perform music once beloved by those divine beings. Whether by harp, by flute, or voice alone, joyous melodies are shared between farmers as they sew their seeds across the vast plains of Tailtean and Gronder.

@Dialogue 
Seteth: As you have already been notified, your mission is to subdue some bandits. Our students have been learning about combat through study, but this is a precious opportunity to provide them with practical experience. The knights will support your mission and are prepared to offer their assistance if necessary. In short, this is no mock battle. You must be prepared for anything. You will receive a message from the knights when it is time to depart. Until then, use your time wisely.

^start 
Edelgard: The last time we fought bandits, you saved me. Maybe I can return the favor this time.
Byleth: Let's do our best.
Byleth: Don't get careless.
Edelgard: The knights are well aware of our enemy's strength. We can count of them to keep the battlefield under control for us. It seems unlikely that we would lose. Still, let's do all we can to prepare.

Dimitri: This will be our first true battle. I'm looking forward to fighting alongside you, Professor.
Byleth: As am I.
Byleth: I'm a bit concerned.
Dimitri: During the mock battle, your commands were thoughtful and thorough, as was your strategy. With you on our side, I'm confident we will prevail. It seems we have some time to spare before our departure. Let's use this opportunity to prepare as best we can.

Claude: More bandits? Not very original, Teach.
Byleth: Not interested?
Byleth: You need to focus.
Claude: Well, as long as you're with us, at least things won't be boring. In fact... It may take a turn for the interesting. And with that, I take my leave to make my final preparations.
^end

Jeralt: You seem well. Are you adjusting to life at the monastery?
Byleth: I think so.
Jeralt: Oh? I didn't expect that answer. When we were mercenaries, I handled everything. Outside of battle, you didn't have much contact with people, did you? I thought being thrown into a swarm of noble brats to teach would be a bit much for you. But I guess I was wrong to worry.
Byleth: Not quite. 
Jeralt: Well, I didn't expect it would be easy on you. When we were mercenaries, I handled everything. Outside of battle, you didn't have much contact with people, did you? I thought being thrown into a swarm of noble brats to teach would be a bit much for you. It seems I was right to worry.
Jeralt: By the way, I heard about those bandits. Your first assignment is to take them out, right? That's fairly routine for you by now, but don't forget it's the first real taste of battle for those brats. It'll be tougher to sleep at night if you let one of your little pupils die, so stay vigilant and lead them well. I wish I could offer you my support, but Lady Rhea won't allow it. For now, I'll try to figure out what she wants from you. I don't mind you settling into your life here, but don't let your guard down. Ever.

Byleth: ... (A girl's voice... What could it mean?)

@Conversation
Edelgard: For some students, this will be their first time stepping onto a real battlefield. It's important that they're mentally prepared. As for me? Ha! Do I look green to you? Is there anything you wish to ask me about, regarding spending your time at the monastery or battles?
Edelgard: Just as students have much to learn from other students, professors can also share their knowledge with each other. You should consider seeking instruction from Professor Hanneman or Professor Manuela. I think you'll find their insight quite interesting.
Edelgard: Which house a student is assigned to depends on where they're from. That said, each professor has their own area of expertise. So if a student is adamant about it, it is possible to switch someone from one house to another. Pending your approval, of course. If you become closer with the students by partaking in the various activities around the monastery, you'll be able to talk to them about such things.

Edelgard: You're quite powerful to have beaten us in the mock battle. Such a shame you aren't leading our class...

Dimitri: We have only just arrived at the academy, and we're already being sent out to take care of bandits. It is a noble mission, but one that will likely require battle. In practice, there is little difference between a battle and a war. Even with the support of the Knights of Seiros, we must still brace ourselves for the challenge. Do you have any other questions about life at the monastery or about battle?
Dimitri: Just as students receive guidance from professors, professors may also guide each other. If you're interested, you should seek out Professor Hanneman or Professor Manuela.
Dimitri: A student's house is determined by their place of origin, but naturally, each individual has their own aptitudes and interests. That said, if a student so desires and their current professor consents, they may transfer from one house to another. If you get to know the students better through the activities at the monastery, they may approach you about this.

Dimitri: Your performance in the mock battle was exceptional, Professor. You have inspired me to follow your example and study even more diligently. Perhaps we could train together sometime. I would love to test myself against your sword skills again.

Claude: Those bandits really didn't think things through, did they? They had to have known the knights would be after them the moment they entered the monastery's turf. Fine by me, though. I'm raring for some real combat experience. Any chance to grow is a good thing. Is there anything else you want to ask me, Teach? About living at the monastery or combat, anything like that?
Claude: Students aren't the only ones who have something to learn from their professors. Professors can also learn from each other. If you want to, you should try trading knowledge with Professor Hanneman or Professor Manuela.
Claude: The house a student belongs to is determined by where they're from, but it is possible for someone to switch to a different one. Of course, that's only if the student very strongly wants to make the change and their professor is on board with it. If you do a lot of different activities around the monastery, you'll get closer to students and they may ask you about it.

Claude: I hear you've been tasked with hunting down bandits, right? Meanwhile, my class is stuck with a downright peaceful mission. Sounds like you'll be fighting alongside the knights too. Don't let the monastery down, Teach.

Hubert: I fully accept the necessity of real battle from time to time, but it is still a surprise to be tasked with punishing bandits without warning. It is a rather different sort of mission. It makes me wonder what the archbishop is planning...



Hubert: I've heard your class is hunting thieves. That mission is very different from the one we were given.



Ferdinand: Do you know of the Aegir family? We have long held the position of prime minister in the Empire. The Empire's power lies with six noble families, my family foremost among them. The full explanation may be time-consuming. I can give you a moment to get ready, if you would like to take notes.
Byleth: I'm not taking notes.
Byleth: I'm ready.
Ferdinand: All right. I will list the six great noble families. There's Caspar's father, Count Bergliez, the Minister of Military Affairs. Then there's Linhardt's father, Count Hevring, the Minister of Domestic Affairs. Beradetta's father, Count Varley, is the Minister of Religious Affairs. Hubert's father, Marquis Vestra, is the Minister of the Imperial Household. Finally we have Duke Gerth, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and my own father, Duke Aegir, the Prime Minister. One day, I will take his place as the prime minister of the Empire. I am more talented than anyone in my class â even Edelgard. I will lead the Empire to a bright, enlightened future.
Byleth: I look forward to that. 
Byleth: That sounds like wishful thinking.
Ferdinand: There is nothing I cannot achieve.



Linhardt: Swimming through a sea of countless books, tracking down that single sought-after volume... It's absolute bliss. How do the poor fools who spend their days sharpening swords and polishing armor find any joy in life?



Caspar: Hey there, Professor! You here to check in on my training? Oh, that reminds me. I found this small cloth. It's kinda weird. Not really sure what it is, but it works great for wiping up sweat!
Byleth: ...

Bernadetta: Wh-what is it? I'm not doing anything!
Byleth: It's not good to just do nothing.
Bernadetta: I'm not bothering anybody...am I?
Byleth: Hey, what's this cake doing out here? 
Bernadetta: Cake?! Oh, come on... That's just cruel.

Dorothea: Oh, Professor... Hello. I was just looking for myâ Well, it's...it's like a pale blue cloth. Have you seen it?
Byleth: Let's search for it.
Dorothea: Eh? Um... OK...
Byleth: I'll tell Manuela. 
Dorothea: Thank you so much.

Petra: Brigid has much more warmth than FÃ³dlan. Even spring here has coolness! And you, Professor? Which do you find is worst? Too hot or too cold weather?
Byleth: The cold. 
Petra: I have agreeance! In Brigid, I am able to be wearing much lighter clothes.
Byleth: The heat.
Petra: But you are wearing many things, Professor. If you are not liking the heat, you should be wearing lighter clothes.



Dedue: It is better if you do not approach me. If you spend too much time around a man of Duscur, there will be rumors.



Felix: For years, the boar prince and I were inseparable. I know him better than almost anyone else. So let me give you some advice. Beneath all that princely polish, he's an animal, nothing more. He's strong and skilled, sure. But don't place your trust in him as a human being. Take care he doesn't chew you up and spit you out.



Ashe: It's thanks to my adoptive father, Lonato, that a commoner like me is here at the academy. He is the very model of chivalry. Someday I'm going to be just like him.

Sylvain: Professor, you're the one taking out the bandits? Heh, that's one way to start your career at the academy. I didn't realize they'd order us to risk our lives here. Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it?

Sylvain: Our first assignment is to take out some bandits? Did anyone tell Lady Rhea that people's lives are at stake? I lost my own brother to bandits... ...Is something someone has said at some point, I'm sure. OK. Not my finest attempt at humor.

Mercedes: The cathedral is nice and quiet. It's so relaxing... Oh, Professor. Did you come to pray to the goddess?
Byleth: That's right. 
Mercedes: Me too! Shall we pray together?
Byleth: I did not.
Mercedes: No? But shall we pray together while you're here?



Annette: I've got to find out everyone's likes and dislikes so I know what to cook. Who knows when it will be my turn at kitchen duty! How about you, Professor? Do you like sweet or spicy food?
Byleth: Sweet. 
Annette: Ooh, same! I'll definitely remember that!
Byleth: Spicy.
Annette: Spicy? Ooh, your tastes are so mature! I'll definitely remember that.




Ingrid: Felix, Sylvain and I have known each other since we were children. His Highness, as well. Though I should warn you that both Felix and Sylvain are a bit...challenging at times. The moment I take my eyes off them, they're off causing all kinds of trouble. It's always been that way.

Ingrid: Now that you're all the way over here, Professor, care to join me in some training? After training, I love tending to the horses or burying myself in a good pile of books. Ahh, there's truly nothing better!



Lorenz: It is the duty of every FÃ³dlan noble to demonstrate piety toward Seiros. Have you also come to offer your prayers to the goddess, Professor?
Byleth: Sure.
Lorenz: You don't sound terribly sure. Perhaps you are not of noble birth? After all, devotion is not as essential for a commoner.
Byleth: Not exactly. 
Lorenz: I see. The truth is, I am not a particularly devoted believer either. But it would be unbecoming for a noble like me to neglect his prayers, wouldn't it?



Raphael: The next assignment is to track down bandits? Sounds like some training is in order! Tell me something, Professor. When it comes to a one-on-one battle, which is better? Strength or skill?
Byleth: Strength. 
Raphael: I knew it! When it's all said and done, muscle always comes out on top.
Byleth: Skill.
Raphael: You might be right. But when it's all said and done, I still think muscle comes out on top!



Ignatz: I'm so glad to be a student here, if only because I get to use this library. Reading books from all the regions of FÃ³dlan... I feel almost like I'm visiting those places myself.
Byleth: You should visit them in person.
Ignatz: I'd like to. I don't have many chances to travel...
Byleth: You can learn so much from books. 
Ignatz: I agree! They're brimming with the knowledge and experience of our ancestors.



Lysithea: There were way too many vegetables in today's meal. The ratio of vegetables to sweets was completely skewed... Oh! Hi, Professor! Were you just eavesdropping on me? Well...everyone knows a plateful of sweets is far preferred to a plateful of vegetables, regardless of age.




Marianne: Um, Professor? Our next mission is to go after a group of bandits. I'm...not very confident. I'm afraid I'll just hold everyone else back. I should probably stay behind for this one. Or help plan the attack instead.

Marianne: Uh. Hello. Um, if you'll excuse me...



Hilda: I'm bored! Maybe I should go into town... But that would be such a hassle. Oh! Hi, Professor. I'm rather busy right now, so do make it quick.
Byleth: You don't look busy to me.
Hilda: Ah, you can tell? I suppose being a professor has taught you how to ferret out time wasters.
Byleth: If you're busy, never mind. 
Hilda: Are you sure? I thought you'd found me out for a moment there...

Leonie: Professor! Hey, do you know how old Captain Jeralt is?
Jeralt: That's enough, Leonie. If I don't know, how could my child know?
Leonie: It's not normal to forget your own age, you know. It's kind of worrisome, actually.
Jeralt: By the time you're forgetting your own age, you're past the point of caring.
Leonie: I guess if you put it that way, you've got a point...

Rhea: Thank you for paying me a visit. Is there anything troubling you? Or is there, perhaps, something I can help you with.
Byleth: I wonder if the students are taking to me...
Rhea: You seem to be getting along well with the students. I would advise you to be confident in your abilities. The rest will fall into place in time.
Byleth: About the teachings of Seiros... 
Rhea: Believers live their lives by her sacred wisdom. Please use the library's vast resources to learn more.
Rhea: I can often be found here, so if there is ever anything you need, please do not hesitate to pay me a visit.

Seteth: Inside the cathedral, there is a chapel dedicated to the Four Saints. Do you know of them? Saint Indech, Saint Macuil, Saint Cichol, and...
Flayn: Saint Cethleann! Who is your favorite, Professor?
Seteth: Now that you are a member of the church, be sure to familiarize yourself with our teachings and traditions.

Alois: Oh, Professor! How are you today? I'm just heading out for a mission. I'll be seeing you!
Byleth: Good luck. 
Alois: I don't need luck! This will be a piece of cake. I'll be back before you know it!
Byleth: Be careful.
Alois: What make you say that? Do you know something I don't? Are there supernatural elements at play? Ghosts?! Ah...oh, forget it. I'll be going now.

Shamir: Have we met?
Shamir: No. Sorry. Must be my imagination.

Jeritza: You look bored. Care to duel?
Byleth: A duel?
Byleth: To the death?
Jeritza: What? I just wanted to spar...

Hanneman: Excellent work guiding the students in the mock battle. Taking command like that? Simply splendid. And bearing the unknown Crest's power? Yes! I'm talking about you. Your talents are incredible, and Lady Rhea's insight as to your potential is doubly so.

Manuela: You know, Professor, there are some things I'll just never understand. Like the other night, I went on a date with a dashing, handsome, strong, young knight. Oh, I'm a bit weak just remembering him. Anyway... Do you know what that no-good jerk said when we got back to my room? He said, "What a mess. I'm afraid to go in there!" Can you believe it?! You know who cares about keeping everything neat and tidy? Not me, that's who. "Afraid to go in there." Some knight he is!



Tomas: Do you know about the cardinals? They are the ones who run the church. Their identities are a closely guarded secret...



Cyril: That person sure does remind me of somebody, but I can't figure out who. Oh, do ya need me for something? Sorry, but I'm really busy right now.



Anna: Hello there! Are you that new professor everyone's talking about? Name's Anna. I'm a merchant who slings wares all around FÃ³dlan... and beyond! I come in here all the time, so I'm sure our paths will cross more. Hopefully much more!



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Are you settled in here at the monastery yet? Make sure to have a good look around! There's much to see! Like fish! You do know about the pond behind the dining hall, right? You can fish there! Give it a try!



Knight of Seiros: We will accompany you on your assignment. We don't want anything to happen to our precious students. If any of you run into trouble, we'll step in and help out!



Knight of Seiros: The Knights of Seiros are also known as the shining knights. We are the sword and shield of the divine Seiros. There are many orders of knights in the world, but we are the only one that has the honor of bearing the name Seiros. As a member of the church, you should probably study up on the history of Seiros and the knights.



Knight of Seiros: I hear the Officers Academy of the monastery was founded about two centuries ago. The eastern region of FÃ³dlan was being invaded by Almyra, and so the archbishop of the time took measures to prevent the border from being taken. In order to ensure FÃ³dlan would be safe from potential threats, she deemed it necessary to raise a generation of excellence. That is how the establishment was founded, though its purpose has changed over the years.



Monk: Zanado, the Red Canyon, is a place of great significance to the Church of Seiros. Even members of the church are forbidden from entering without permission. To go trampling around in there, causing trouble... Those bandits truly are morally reprehensible.



Student: Brigid, Almyra, Duscur... Even people from far-off lands gather here at the academy. Word of advice, Professor. There are those who don't think kindly of such people.

@Intro
^start 
Edelgard: Perfect timing, Professor. I just received word from the knights. They've located the bandits.
Hubert: It seems they have them cornered. They are in Zanado, the Red Canyon.
Caspar: I can't wait to get started! I'll strike down those heinous thieves before they know what hit them!
Ferdinand: Charge ahead if you must, Caspar. Just do not put the rest of us in danger.
Bernadetta: I'm going back. I won't be of any help anyway, and I don't want to get hurt.
Dorothea: Don't worry, Bern. It's just some bandits. We'll have no trouble at all.
Linhardt: Eh, don't get ahead of yourselves. Unfounded optimism isn't a great strategy. Let's just get this over with.
Petra: There is nothing to get over. We will work with each other to achieve our mission.
Byleth: You seem excited to get out there.
Byleth: I'm not sure about this...
Edelgard: It's time, Professor. Give us our orders, and let's move out.

Dimitri: Professor. I just got word from the knights that the last of the thieves have been cornered.
Ingrid: Just as planned. They're in Zanado, the Red Canyon.
Ashe: We certainly can't allow those underhanded thieves to get away. Let's work together and do our best to take them down!
Dedue: It matters not who we're up against. They will not harm His Highness.
Felix: Hmph. We're just fighting common thieves, right? I don't expect much of a challenge.
Sylvain: Aren't you a spoilsport. I'm actually quite excited myself. Who knows... There may even be some cute lady thieves.
Annette: Hmm. Well, at any rate, a real battle is a great opportunity for us to see how far we've come.
Mercedes: True. The mock battle was a success. We'll be fine so long as we stay the course.
Byleth: So much excitement...
Byleth: I hope everything turns out all right.
Dimitri: Perhaps we are a bit overly excited, but remember that we have the knights on our side. All should be well. Ah! And speaking of the knights, I heard that Jeralt is once again one of the Knights of Seiros. Perhaps we'll have the good fortune of seeing you two fight side by side.
Byleth: This isn't a game.
Byleth: We've fought together many times.
Dimitri: Oh, of course. I apologize for letting my childish whims get the better of me. In all honesty, I'm a bit jealous. My parents are no longer around.
Byleth: What do you mean?
Byleth: No longer around?
Dimitri: They...they died. Both of them. I'm all that remains of them now... Anyhow, I'm sorry to bore you with such things. I'd say it's nearly time for us to depart. Eh, Professor?

Claude: Hey, Teach. Glad you could make it. We've been waiting on you.
Lorenz: It seems the knights have our foes cornered. They are in Zanadoâthe Red Canyon.
Raphael: It's bandit time? That sounds like real knight work. Let's get to it!
Leonie: I'm itching to put my skills to the test as well. We have to win so Captain Jeralt can see how much I've learned!
Ignatz: I thought Jeralt wasn't coming with us. Either way, I'll give it everything I've got.
Marianne: Um... Even if I go, it's not like I'd be of any use...
Lysithea: That's enough of that. If we don't work together and give it our all, we are doomed to fail.
Hilda: You can be pretty intense sometimes, Lysithea. But I agree! Let's do our best!
Byleth: Everyone is so eager.
Byleth: I wonder how we will do...
Claude: If we fight half as well as we chatter, we'll be fine. C'mon, Teach. Lead the way.
^end

@Intro 
Sothis: So, we are taking children into battle, are we? I am not certain I will be able to sleep soundly after beholding something like that... I shall allow you to turn back the hands of time, but know this power is not infinite!

Edelgard: So this is the Red Canyon... A ruin of sorts by the look of it. Let's end this quickly. The thieves must have been driven back. Be careful, or the cornered mice might bite us.

Dimitri: The Red Canyon... This is the first time I have ever been here. It's like walking through a ruin. Let's get this battle out of the way, Professor. The thieves must have already been driven back.

Claude: So this is the Red Canyon? Doesn't look red to me... Anyway, let's get things started, Teach. Looks like the thieves have been driven back. That's what we last heard, so no surprise there.

Kostas: The knights chased us all the way here?!
Thief: Chief, let's get out of here! There's no way we can win against them!
Kostas: Shut your dumb mouth! Where would we go at this point? You can't be a thief if you fear death!

@Battle
Edelgard: Professor...I hear there's a back road to the west. Why don't we split up and attack from both the west and the front? If we advance tactfully, we can attack our enemy from both sides. I leave the rest to you. Regardless, we must cross the bridge first.


Edelgard: Regrettable...but there was no other way.

Hubert: Allow me to clean this up for you, Lady Edelgard.

Ferdinand: These ruffians are no match for a noble like me!

Linhardt: I...I killed them. What have I done? The blood...

Caspar: Are all real battles this exciting? Come on, let's get on to the next one!

Bernadetta: I don't care if they're stealing! Can I go home?!

Dorothea: So, is making us experience a real battle part of the church's teachings?

Petra: People and beasts are as one. Calm your heart, and do not be worried about this killing.

Edelgard: Thank you for leading us, Professor. Though I suppose there was no way we could lose to a familiar foe. In any case, something about this canyon feels...inexplicably strange.

Dimitri: According to our information, there is a back road to the west. Let's split up and approach from the west and the front. If we advance cleverly, we attack from both sides and gain the advantage. I'll leave the rest to you, Professor. But before all else, we'll need to cross the bridge.

Dimitri: I know they are just thieves, but this never gets easier for me...

Felix: Finished already? I was hoping for more of a challenge.

Ashe: If Iâd hesitated... that wouldâve been me.

Sylvain: I had to do it. Donât hate me, please.

Ingrid: I canât relax here. We need to prepare for our next battle!

Annette: I did it! See? Iâm a great fighter!

Mercedes: I hope the goddess blesses them to rest in peace...

Dedue: Still whole and sound, I hope...

Dimitri: We have defeated the thieves. We'll follow the knights' instructions for what to do next. You led us well, Professor.

Claude: I hear there's a back road to the west. How about we split up and attack from there and from the front? We may be able to corner the enemy by approaching from both sides. In any case, we need to cross the bridge first. I'll leave the details to you, Teach.

Claude: We were taken by surprise last time, but... I guess this is what we can expect when battling thieves.

Lorenz: It is a noble's duty to guard the welfare of the people. Nothing personal

Hilda: I was planning to just sit back and watch. But hey, I got one!

Ignatz: I'm sorry... I didn't have a choice.

Raphael: This is my first real fight. I guess I'm pretty strong!

Lysithea: A precious opportunity to test my own strength. I won't make waste of your deaths.

Marianne: Please forgive me, Goddess...and save their souls...

Leonie: This is what I've trained for!

Claude: Those thieves ran out of luck when they entered this canyon. They never had a chance. Your leadership was amazing, Teach. Let's leave the rest of the work to the knights.

Thief: We stole this treasure! It's all ours! There's not way we're gonna give it up to some knights!

@Boss 
Kostas: Damn, they're coming from the west too! I can't stand these brats!

Kostas: Sending these brats instead of the knights means they've underestimated me! Big mistake!

Kostas: I should have never listened to that idiot... What a mistake... 

%Byleth,Kostas
Kostas: Y-you're... It can't be! The mercenary from before? So what, now you're pals with the knights? I'll kill you and your pesky brats!

%Edelgard,Kostas
Kostas: Spoiled little noble! Just die like a good little rich kid!
Edelgard: Do you really think being born a commoner gives you the right to kill? Despicable.

%Dimitri,Kostas
Kostas: Spoiled little noble! Just die like a good little rich kid!
Dimitri: Unfortunately for you, I will not oblige. You will regret all that you have done.

%Claude,Kostas
Kostas: Spoiled little noble! Just die like a good little rich kid!
Claude: Being noble has nothing to do with who you are as a person or how hard your life is. Your logic is illogical!

@End 
Byleth: ...
Byleth: I remember this being a peaceful place... 
Byleth: Since when has it been called the Red Canyon... 
Byleth: ... ?
Sothis: Hmm... I wonder why it is that you recall this place.  You must be weak of heart. Each time I speak, it scares you so.
Byleth: I'm sorry.
Sothis: Although the battle is at an end, do not feel too at ease.
Byleth: You surprised me. 
Sothis: Although the battle's at an end, do not feel too at ease.
Byleth: I'm not scared.
Sothis: Do you think you can lie to me? It saddens me to know you wish to hide such things from me.
Sothis: Well, anyhow... I am quite fascinated by this place. As far as I can tell, this is your first time here...
Byleth: Still, it feels familiar.
Sothis: How very odd. I wonder if somehow, my memories have... Hmm.
Byleth: Have you been here before, Sothis?
Sothis: Here? I daresay it would be impossible to have forgotten such as place as this.
Sothis: I must admit I am unsure. Beyond the name and this strange feeling of familiarity, I can't seem to remember anything about this place. And yet...a great depth of emotion is tied to that sense of familiarity. Like joy and sorrow. Pain and love. And all things in between... If I was somehow here before, I wonder what took place...

Edelgard: Professor? I was wondering where you were... It's about time we headed back to the monastery.

Dimitri: Professor? We should return to the monastery soon. We're all ready for the journey.

Claude: Teach? What are you doing here? We should get back to the academy.

Sothis: It is time to depart. But know that time reveals all things. One day, I will remember that which I have lost... Oh, by the way. It seems you've earned my gratitude. The thieves who came here are no more.
Byleth: Why are you grateful?
Byleth: Why are you...
Sothis: I am not sure myself, yet I am grateful all the same. In any case... You must become accustomed to my voice! If you fall down with shock each time I speak, that just won't do.
Sothis: Oh... You think you're standing strong? Of course you are! It was a jest.

^start 
Edelgard: On our way out, I had the chance to observe the Red Canyon... Did you notice anything, Professor?
Byleth: What are you talking about?
Edelgard: Oh, I suppose it was only me, then.
Byleth: I did. 
Edelgard: Of course. I expected as much.
Edelgard: The area was covered in ruins, each more curious than the last. They did not match the architectural style of any era or culture within the Empire. Or across all of FÃ³dlan, for that matter. That can only mean one thing... The valley's civilization must have flourished and fallen in the distant past, long before the Empire was established. Who do you think lived there?
Byleth: Our ancestors.
Byleth: A culture long since perished. 
Byleth: Subterranean beings. 
Edelgard:  Heh, it's possible they weren't even human.
Edelgard: Hmm, perhaps their remnants still influence this world...

Dimitri: We're finally back. I'll leave the report to Lady Rhea in your hands, Professor.
Dimitri: Huh... Edelgard.
Dimitri: Does the Black Eagle House have a mission to see to? Rememberâon a real battlefield, one can never tell what's to come. You can never dismiss the possibility of a worst case scenario. Take care, Edelgard.
Edelgard: There's no need to state the obvious, Dimitri. But tell me... Why the concern? Perhaps you doubt my abilities? If so, your lack of insight is disappointing.
Dimitri: That's...not what I meant. If I've offended you, I hope you'll accept my apology.
Edelgard: Don't worry about it. Professor, we must hurry. Everyone's waiting on you. 
Manuela: I suppose I should be off too. Try not to let her get to you, Dimitri. I promise you, there's no need for concern. 
Dimitri: Hmm...
Byleth: Why are you so worried?
Dimitri: I'll tell you all about it...some other time.
Byleth: Puppy love? 
Dimitri: Hahaha! Now, that's a lark. I had no idea you had a sense of humor, Professor. I'll tell you all about it...some other time.

Claude: Hey, Teach. On the way back, you seemed transfixed by the canyon. Did something happen there?
Byleth: It's nothing
Claude: Nice try, but you can't get anything past me. You saw something...or felt something. I'm sure of it. But hey, if you don't want to share, that's fine by me. Everyone has their secrets.
Byleth: Actually... 
Claude: It seemed familiar to you? Huh. Can't say the same. Maybe it's a memory from when you were a child. Or from a past life. Anyway, if you can't remember, I guess there isn't really much more to be said.
Claude: Although, I'll admit, there is something about that canyon that has me captivated as well. How did Zanado come to be called the Red Canyon? Nothing there...was actually red...
^end

@Dialogue 
Rhea: So, you have safely disposed of those bandits. I pray that their souls find salvation. But why did they target the students to begin with? We must further investigate the true cause of all that took place. Until we know more, I ask that you support the students and relieve them of any unnecessary worry.
Byleth: Of course.
Byleth: I will do all that I can. 
Rhea: Good. I have high expectations for you. By the way, how was your time in Zanado? Legend has it, in ancient times, a goddess alighted upon this world in that very canyon. For a goddess from heavens, Zanado could only have been a temporary haven.
Byleth: A goddess?
Byleth: A temporary haven?
Rhea: Long ago, the divine Seiros received a revelation from the goddess. A gift, to help the lost. The goddess is always watching over FÃ³dlan from her kingdom above. However, in ancient times, the goddess graced this world with her presence and offered salvation to the people here. She is the mother of all life, the arbiter of every soul.
Byleth: I didn't know.
Byleth: My father never told me.
Rhea: I see. During your time here, I pray that you come to devote yourself to the teachings of Seiros.
Seteth: Uh...Lady Rhea, I am sorry to interrupt. There is something I must ask about in regard to those bandits...
Rhea: As you wish. We shall continue our discussion when next we meet.

Sothis: A goddess... I have no memory of her. But then... I have no memory at all! Oh, how bothersome! It is as though I know...and yet I don't. Perhaps Zanado was my home back when the goddess walked the land. If so... What does that make me now? A ghost?
Byleth: That must be it.
Sothis: Are you simple?! That's impossible! I am most certainly alive.
Byleth: I don't know.
Sothis: Hmm... No. That cannot be. I am most certainly alive.
Sothis: Of course, we also have the mystery of why I'm here with you. Is it somehow connected? Perhaps some past regret is stopping me from moving on, and now I'm forced to stay with you instead... No, that's not it! I can't believe in such a meaningless existence! I... I... 
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
The ceaseless rains that satiate the verdant landscape of FÃ³dlan are accompanied the fierce winds and mighty roars of thunder. This abundance of rain, sparkling as it falls against beams of emerging sunlight, is a constant reminder to the people of FÃ³dlan that nature is ever wild and unpredictable. For when the rain finally does pause, the clouds part to give way to a glorious rainbow.

@Intro 
Rhea: I have a new mission for you, Professor. I would like for you to take your students into Kingdom territory to eliminate some thieves.
Seteth: They stole a Hero's Relic from House Gautier of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghusâthe Lance of Ruin. Their leader's name is Miklan. He is apparently a disowned son of House Gautier.
Byleth: Why was he disowned?
Seteth: I believe it had something to do with his lack of a Crest. Such happenings are fairly common within the Kingdom.
Rhea: The Crestless cannot harness the goddess's power, even if they possess a Relic. Nonetheless, they are still capable of simply wielding those weapons.
Byleth: Why must the church eliminate him?
Seteth: This skirmish involves a holy Relic, and is therefore more than a single noble is capable of resolving.
Seteth: The Heroes' Relics are immensely powerful weapons. We must meet this threat with adequate force. Unfortunately, most of the Knights of Seiros are away from the monastery purging the apostates of the Western Church. So we are entrusting you with this mission. After all, you wield the Sword of the Creator, which is more than capable of opposing any Relic.
Rhea: The Sword of the Creator is a powerful weapon, well beyond the other Relics. You have nothing to fear. However, to ensure that no harm comes to the students, we will also send the monastery's most skilled individuals to aid you.
Seteth: I must remind you that you are expected to conduct yourself in a manner befitting the wielder of that holy sword. Also, you should know that Professor Hanneman has been looking for you. That is all.

^start 
Edelgard: Professor, I heard about our mission for this month. A thief with a Hero's Relic is worrisome, but with you at our side, I'm certain we can handle him. After all, you have the Sword of the Creator. It was allegedly wielded by Nemesis, the King of Liberation. If the legends are true, you hold the power to stand against entire armies. A band of thieves should be nothing. Even the most elite Imperial forces or the Knights of Seiros could not hope to defeat you.
Byleth: Why does it matter?
Edelgard: I'm just marveling at the potential. Besides, your power does not lie solely in the Sword of the Creator.
Byleth: It would never come to that.
Edelgard: Is that so? Even if those forces were to hurt someone precious to you? Can you say with full confidence that you would not turn your sword on them if that were to happen? You know, your power does not lie solely in the Sword of the Creator.
Edelgard: You are stronger and more terrifying than you realize. Professor... When we leave the monastery, will you still think of yourself as my teacher?
Byleth: What do you mean?
Byleth: If we left the monastery?
Edelgard: Never mind. I'm being thoughtless with my words. For now, let's just focus on the problem at hand.

Dimitri: I heard about our mission for this month. So... We are to eradicate thieves in Kingdom territory. I'm sorry for dragging into the Kingdom's petty squabbles. This should not be your burden to bear, but my own...
Byleth: I'm happy to help. 
Byleth: It's just a job.
Dimitri: Thank you, Professor. Hearing you say that puts my mind at ease.
Dimitri: Hm?
Rodrigue: Your Highness? Ah, it's been ages!
Dimitri: It's been a long time! Two years, if I'm not mistaken.
Rodrigue: Indeed, Your Highness. You've grown so much in those years. I hardly recognize you.
Byleth: Who's this?
Byleth: A friend of yours?
Dimitri: This is Rodrigue, an old friend of my father's. I believe I've mentioned him, if you recall. When my father died four years ago, he looked after me as though I were his own son.
Rodrigue:  You flatter me, Your Highness. It was my honor to care for such a fine, young man. It's nice to finally meet you, Professor. My son, Felix, has mentioned you on occasion.
Dimitri: What brings you to the monastery, Rodrigue? Is it the thieves plaguing the Kingdom?
Rodrigue: I'm afraid so. This is not merely a problem for House Gautier, but for everyone. The thieves have set up their headquarters in Fraldarius territory, and are mercilessly pillaging the villages of that area. You have our full support in stopping those dastards. I thank you for your help, both of you.

Claude: Hey, Teach. I gotta say, I never would've guessed you were a descendant of the King of Liberation. You didn't forget, did you? That story I told you about a Relic that could cut a mountain in half? That Relic was the Sword of the Creator! The very same used by Nemesis, the King of Liberation.
Byleth: What are you talking about?
Byleth: I'm not his descendant.
Claude: Don't be coy, Teach. The Sword of the Creator could only be wielded by Nemesis. If you can use it too, that can only mean you have that bloodline's Crest.
Byleth: I don't understand.
Claude: Fine, keep your secrets. But just so you know, "I don't understand" isn't gonna cut it here at the monastery. Speaking of, Professor Hanneman has been looking for you. He probably wants to examine your Crest with those crazy instruments of his. Actually...sounds amusing. Maybe I'll tag along.
Judith: If it isn't my little Claude! What has you so worked up?
Claude: Judith?! What are you doing here?
Judith: That's Lady Judith to you, boy. I told you, until you're in charge, I expect you to address me with all due respect. Anyway, I'm here to retrieve you. Duke Riegan's condition has taken a turn for the worse.
Claude: Are you saying the old man's on his death bed?
Judith: No, it's not that bad. But in the state he's in, he won't be able to participate in the next roundtable conference. He wants you to go in his stead. I volunteered to play the messenger.
Claude: Well, thanks for that. Oh, and Teach, this is Judith. Also known as the Hero of House Daphnel.
Judith: So you're little Claude's teacher, are you? How much trouble has he been giving you?
Byleth: Plenty.
Byleth: Not too much.
Claude: If her nickname didn't give it away, you should know that Judith...er, Lady Judith is the leader of the famous House Daphnel of the Leicester Alliance. She used to be a big deal at the roundtable conferences, but it seems of late she's been reduced to a mereâ
Judith: You had better shut that mouth before I put my boot in it, you tactless nuisance! Now come on. Let's get going. Sorry, Professor, but I need to borrow the boy for a bit.
Claude: I suppose we'll have to finish our chat later. Sorry, Teach. But don't you worry. I'll be back in time for our next mission. All right, Judith. Let's get going.
Judith: It's Lady... Ah, I suppose you are the active leader for the time being. Fair enough, boy. Fair enough.

Hanneman: Good of you to come, Professor. I've heard much about you lately. Specifically, that you were able to awaken the Sword of the Creator's power. Thusly, it seems the true nature of your Crest has been uncovered. I had, of course, seen your Crest before. However, at first, I failed to recognize its true nature. Eventually, it dawned on me that what is visible is perhaps merely a small part of a greater whole. In other words, your Crest is too significant to be detected when using normal instruments. After this discovery, I began researching Crests that might fit that description, which allowed for a temporary hypothesis. However, I could not be certain. The Crest my conclusions led me to was far too unusual. A Crest thought to have disappeared in this world in the millennium since the fall of Nemesis, the King of Liberation. The Crest of Flames. That is what you possess.
Byleth: The Crest of Flames...
Hanneman: Your ability to wield the Sword of the Creator has unequivocally proven my hypothesis. A legendary power, dormant since time immemorial, and now resurrected... There can be no doubt that this ancient power resides within you.

@Conversation 
Sothis: A stone? A stone... I do not understand. Yet as I think of it, the pounding in my chest grows faster still. But is that me...or is it you? Hmm...

Edelgard: For a Hero's Relic to be stolen... It's unheard of.
Hubert: And just last month, the Sword of the Creator was almost stolen too.
Edelgard: Also quite unheard of. What imprudence.
Hubert: For House Gautier to invite us on to their land, they must be desperate. But at least we'll have the stalwart knights ready to stand around and watch us do all the work.

Dimitri: Say, I hear that a Knight of Seiros named Gilbert will be joining us for our mission this moon. He is skilled, which is surely a boon for us. Still... That was not very thoughtful of Lady Rhea.
Byleth: Do you know him?
Dimitri: Ahh, well... No, I do not. Not really. All I will say is that we have trained together a few times in the past.
Byleth: Do you have history with him?
Dimitri: No... It's nothing. In any case, you should at least introduce yourself to him before we depart.
Dimitri: House Gautier is Sylvain's home. It would be nice if you could check on him as well.



Dimitri: I am sorry that the Kingdom's unrest did not stop with Lord Lonato... Professor... The Heroes' Relics are incredibly powerful. Please be on your guard.




Claude: Oof. This wasn't the first time I've taken part in an Alliance roundtable conference, but it was still exhausting. There's not enough cooperation in that group, especially from Lorenz's father. But at least my grandfather was surprisingly alert. Judging by that, I'd say he's got at least five more years in him.



Claude: Hey, Teach. I hear you were able to use the Sword of the Creator. That means... What does that mean? Could it mean that you're a descendant of Nemesis, the King of Liberation?!


Ferdinand: The coffin of Seiros in the Holy Mausoleum should have held her remains. Instead, they say, it held the Sword of the Creator. What could it mean?




Linhardt: Swinging a sword about in the Holy Mausoleum? The potential for damage is too great to imagine. I sincerely hope the saints' coffins were not damaged.
Byleth: They didn't. 
Byleth: One might've been scratched.
Linhardt: Were you using magic? I've heard you weren't, butâ Ugh! It's torture not being able to go inside the Holy Mausoleum for an entire year.



Linhardt: You and your class were at that fight in the Holy Mausoleum, right? I sincerely hope the holy artifacts are unscathed. I admit I wish I could've been there to see it all, even if it does make me queasy. But I was there too early. I'd gone first thing in the morning. At noon, one of the monks chased me out saying I'd been there too long. Who were they to decide when I've been somewhere too long?




Caspar: I heard a relic was stolen. If this had something to do with a family conflict, I don't think I could choose a side.
Byleth: Even if there's a clear guilty party?
Caspar: I think I'd be a pretty good judge of that!
Byleth: We can't allow a Hero's Relic to be stolen. 
Caspar: What if it's some kind of powerful weapon? I want one too!
Caspar: I know Relics aren't easy to come by, but I'd still like to get my hands on one...




Caspar: I'm gonna keep training until I can beat you!

Bernadetta:  I'm not secretly eating cake!
Byleth: I can sense it.
Bernadetta: Hmm... OK, what's Bernie doing right now? Oh, fine. You got me. But keep it a secret, all right?
Byleth: I'll take your word for it. 
Bernadetta: You're getting pretty good at talking through the door, Professor!



Dorothea: So, you have a Crest too, eh, Professor? Does that mean you're descended from nobility? You've certainly got the look for it... I sure do wish there were more nobles like you, Professor. A teacher, a mercenary, and so very mysterious... How could a girl ever get enough?



Petra: I have never had goings to the Kingdom's north. I hear the people of north are cold and have much loneliness. Professor, I hear you have had work...have worked as a mercenary in the Kingdom. Did you find joy in this? You cannot remember? Is that having possibility? I have amazement...




Dedue: I know Lord Rodrigue. He paid repeated visits to His Highness after the previous king was killed.



Dedue: The Western Church. The Central Church. They believe in the same goddess, but oppose one another. FÃ³dlan is a complicated place.




Felix: Have you seen a man who looks like me? He's middle-aged and relatively tall.
Byleth: I have. 
Byleth: I have not.
Felix: If you get the chance, tell him I've gone out. OK?



Felix: Think of it! The Sword of the Creator, belonging to the ancient King Nemesis. You have to master it as soon as you can. I can't wait to face off against such a legendary weapon!




Ashe: So the whole plan to attack the monastery was some plot devised by the Western Church? That means they used Lonato. What right do they have to drag a good man like that into their schemes?!

Ashe: There's going to be a big investigation into the Western Church soon. I wish I could be a part of it. I want to hear for myself why Lonato had to die.




Sylvain: I'm so sorry my older brother is causing you all this hassle, Professor. Don't misunderstand, I always thought he was a piece of garbage, but I never thought he'd steal the Relic. I can't wait to see his face when he realizes I'm in the group that was sent to take him down.

Sylvain: I can't believe my own brother is the leader of the bandits. House Gautier is my true home...and his. Please, Professor. He really is one of the worst people I've ever known, but we still... We share the same blood. We're still family.




Mercedes: Isn't it strange? Saint Seiros's body was missing from her coffin, but they found a sword in its place... Do you think she moved from her coffin and left the sword behind?

Mercedes: Professor! You looked like a natural wielding the Sword of the Creator! It's strange though, isn't it? The last owner of the sword was Nemesis, but I thought he didn't have any descendants...




Annette: Hey, Professor? Did you happen to see that man I was looking for earlier? I just spotted him by the dining hall, but then he ran away!
Byleth: Who is he to you?
Annette: He... To be honest, he's my father. He's using a different name now, but there's no mistaking it. It's him. I know it is!
Byleth: I might have seen him. 
Annette: Oh? You saw him by the entrance to the monastery? Thank you, Professor!
Annette: Father... I've found you at last!



Annette: Professor! If you're heading to the Kingdom, I would recommend taking a coat. It's chilly, even at this time of year. It also rains a fair bit. Don't get caught out there without protection, or you're sure to catch a cold!




Ingrid: Wow, Lord Rodrigue in the flesh... What is Felix doing? This is such a rare opportunity for him to see his family...



Ingrid: Professor, please leave Sylvain alone for the time being. The thing is, the bandits' leader who stole the Relic...is Sylvain's disinherited older brother.



Lorenz: I have heard that someone from House Gautier, one of the Kingdom of Faerghus's noble families, is causing some sort of commotion. What a complete disgrace to the nobility.



Raphael: Hey, Professor. Don't you think everyone's making too big a fuss over these Crests or Heroes' Relics or whatever they're called? How important can that stuff really be?
Byleth: It's very important.
Byleth: I'm not sure. 
Raphael: Personally, I don't even care that I don't have a Crest. I'll take muscles over Crests any day. Heck, I'll take muscles over a hot meal! Actually...



Ignatz: Don't you think Professor Hanneman's been acting a bit...strange? Maybe he's made some kind of big discovery.




Lysithea: Is it true that Lady Rhea entrusted the Sword of the Creator to you? I can hardly even fathom you being capable of wielding something of such power. Just who are you, anyway?



Lysithea: Aristocrats are foolsâ-allowing their lives to be dictated by their Crests. Though...I suppose I am much the same in that regard...



Marianne: Some people are unhappy because they don't have the Crest they want... And some are unhappy because they have a Crest they never asked for.



Hilda: I thought school life would be peaceful and quiet, with a sprinkle of drama to keep things interesting. But since you arrived, it's been one thing after another. Is that just a coincidence, I wonder?
Byleth: I believe so. 
Hilda: Oh, I was just kidding! Anyway, as I said before, I do like having a little drama in my life.
Byleth: Maybe. Maybe not.
Hilda: What do you mean? I don't like the way you said that. Stop trying to spook me!



Leonie: Captain Jeralt was all furrowed brow earlier. Do you know what's got him so concerned? If there's a problem, I want to help any way I can.
Byleth: I don't know. 
Leonie: OK. I doubt there's anything I can do for him, but I figured I'd ask anyway.
Byleth: Why don't you ask him yourself?
Leonie: I did, but he just dodged the question. Still, it's worrying to see him like that.



Rhea: You must be rather bewildered by the power that was hidden within. However, know that I believe in you. I have no doubt that you will use that power justly. You will most certainly fulfill the grand destiny that the goddess has seen fit to grant you.




Seteth: Ah, Professor. Jeralt was looking for you.
Byleth: Where is he?
Seteth: It seems he has gone off somewhere. If he is not in his room, then surely someone has seen him. Ask around.



Seteth: How are you managing the Sword of the Creator? No problems? I hope you have not left it lying somewhere unattended or anything foolish like that.
Byleth: No problems. 
Byleth: I'm not quite used to it yet.
Seteth: You will need the sword's power on your next mission. I trust you will handle it without much issue.



Flayn: Why is that fish so...still? Wait-âis it swimming sideways?! Perhaps... Perhaps it is resigned to its woeful fate of being plucked from the water and eaten... Ah, Professor. You are so outgoing with all of the students. I would like to have more opportunities to connect with you, though I am certain my brother would disapprove.



Catherine: You acquitted yourself honorably last month. To think they'd go into the Holy Mausoleum and assault the Goddess Tower... I cannot imagine the Western Church is acting on its own. Someone must have been helping them. As for the masked knight who escaped, his days are numbered. I hope we find him soon, so I can kill him myself.



Gilbert: Hail, Professor. If I may introduce myself, I am Gilbert. My life has been spent as a dedicated knight. I am to accompany you on your assignment. I may have slowed a step in recent years, but I pledge to you the full extent of my abilities.
Byleth: Aren't you too formal?
Gilbert: I beg your pardon, but such is my nature.
Byleth: It's a pleasure to meet you. 
Gilbert: No, Professor. The pleasure is all mine, I assure you.



Jeritza: Mercedes... Her face looks...familiar...





Hanneman: Oh my...the Crest of Flames? Could it really... Yes, the actual Crest of Flames! No, that is quite enough. I should compose myself. I must remain objective in my research. Objective. Professional.
Byleth: Excitement is understandable.
Byleth: I respect your self control. 
Hanneman: The scandal with the Western Church troubles me. We cannot afford to let ourselves be swept along, and yet...



Manuela: It's awful, just awful what happened with the Rite of Rebirth. The infirmary... Well, it was a mess. Things are finally calm again, and so I've come here to unwind. Let me tell you, I put all of my knowledge to use keeping those kids alive. Still, the truth of it is that when someone faces death for the first time...well, they figure out who they are. They learn if they can do it again. We can't lose them, Professor. Not to battle, or to cowardice. If you can keep them going, then I will too.
Byleth: I will protect them. 
Byleth: I will try my best.



Tomas: The head of the Western Church holds the title of bishop. That's not as distinguished as an archbishop such as Lady Rhea, but it still comes with a fair amount of authority. If someone in that position plotted an assassin, I cannot help but think it must have been instigated by some outside force. There are bishops in the Eastern Church as well, but to speak frankly, they do not have much impact. They are under the influence of both the archbishop and the Leicester Alliance, so their ability to voice grievances is quite limited.



Cyril: I hear about the things you did. I'm so glad Lady Rhea's safe. I figure you're a great person after all, Professor.

Anna: I've been hearing a lot about you lately. Word on the street is you wield some amazing sword. If you ever want to sell it to me, I'd pay top G! Just kidding. Sorta. It's, uh, not for sale, is it?

Rodrigue: Professor. Have you seen my son, perchance? I have need of him.
Byleth: He went out.
Rodrigue: Is that so? That is too bad.
Byleth: I believe he's in his quarters.
Rodrigue: Is that so? Thank you, Professor.
Rodrigue: I must ask him not to distract you, Professor, nor His Highness from the matter at hand.



Rodrigue: I am Rodrigue Achille Fraldarius. I bear the great honor of serving as a lord in the Kingdom of Faerghus. I have come in Margrave Gautier's stead to retrieve their stolen Relic. However... As I hear it, a group of students is to attend to this matter. I sincerely hope no harm comes to any of them.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Oh! Come to think of it, last month there was something to report, wasn't there? Thanks to you, I hear that everything was resolved. I never realized that bandits had entered... I'm not a great guard after all, am I? I hope you will forgive me one day.

@Intro 
^start
Edelgard: This weather is unfortunate. Those villagers were right when they said a storm was brewing. But they were more afraid of an attack than they were of the storm. Let's end this quickly.
Hubert: The thieves have taken Conand Tower as their base... There it is in the distance.
Edelgard: Miklan must be more skilled than your average thief to have overtaken a place like that.
Gilbert: This area was the site of a massive battle several hundred years ago. That's when invasions from the north were at their peak. Back then, this tower was built for both surveillance and defense. It will be difficult to seize it.
Edelgard: You know your history, Gilbert. If I recall correctly, you're from the Kingdom aren't you?
Gilbert: I left my home long ago. If you have any questions about the mission, I'd be happy to answer them.
Byleth: What do you know about House Gautier?
Byleth: What do you know about the leader of the thieves?
Gilbert: House Gautier has always placed great importance on whether or not someone bears a Crest. Margrave Gautier has two sons. A Crest never manifested for his eldest. It's not hard to imagine why he left and wound up in this sort of life.
Edelgard: There's no reason that Crests should have the power to dictate someone's destiny. Don't you agree, Gilbert? He was just another victim of cruel fate. Forsaken by the goddess, who now demands his execution.

Dimitri: It should be in our sights soon, Professor. The abandoned tower those thieves are using as a base... Conand Tower.
Gilbert: This area was the site of a massive battle several hundred years ago. That's when invasions from the north were at their peak. Back then, this tower was built for both surveillance and defense. It will be difficult to seize it.
Dimitri: You're very well informed, Gilbert. Please, tell us more.
Gilbert: Well, I... Ah. You're joking.
Dimitri: Professor. Did you see the local villages? They were in rough shape, no doubt because of the thief attacks. They're not going to make it through the winter in that condition. If the thieves had taken up pillaging in order to survive, that would be deplorable...but understandable. But this... This is something else entirely. It looks as though they destroyed those villages purely for pleasure. No matter what their reasons may be, that sort of behavior cannot be allowed. Ever.
Sylvain: Don't bother losing your head over those lowlifes, Your Highness. It's wasted effort.
Dimitri: Sylvain... The thieves' leader...the one who stole the Relic. Word has it he's your older brother. I know he's been disowned, but...
Sylvain: He is no longer a member of House Gautier...or my brother. He's nothing more than a common thief.
Dimitri: Are you sure about that? It would be understandable to find this situation...well, regrettable, to say the least.
Sylvain: Regrets? Heh, you must be joking. You know we're far past the point of regret. And it always falls on the younger brother to clean up the mistakes of their elders, doesn't it?
Dimitri: This rain threatens a coming storm. We must hurry and begin our war council before the heavens let loose.

Claude: Say, Teach. This must be the tower, don't you think? Even for a tower, it's pretty.. er, towering.
Byleth: It's more like a fortress.
Byleth: It would prove difficult to attack.
Claude: It's a remnant of ancient wars... These thieves certainly found themselves a great place to nest. I hear their leader, Miklan, is a former noble. It makes sense he would already know about this place.
Gilbert: Several hundred years ago, this was an important stronghold for diffusing invasions from the north. Back then, this tower was built for both surveillance and defense. It will be difficult to seize it.
Claude: Gilbert, isn't it? You hail from the Kingdom, right? No wonder you're so knowledgeable. While we're chatting so amicably... Do you mind if I ask some questions?
Gilbert: I don't mind. If I can answer them, I will.
Claude: Have you ever seen the Lance of Ruin?
Gilbert: I have. A long time ago. It was an impressive, if not eerily ominous, weapon to behold. According to Margrave Gautier, Miklan has used the lance to turn the tables on his pursuers.
Claude: Is that right? Then those without a Crest can use it as well... Interesting. As far as I knew, that wasn't possible. And then we have the mythical Sword of the Creator, which can't be used by anyone except Teach, Crest or no Crest. Maybe you're just that special, Teach. Or maybe there's something you're not telling us. Either way, I expect big things from you in this battle.
Byleth: Leave it to me.
Claude: Ha! I love a good show of confidence. I'll do my best too. You can count on it.
Byleth: I'm relying on you, Claude.
Claude: Are you now? Then why don't you hand over the Sword of the Creator for a bit? Then again, it would just be a heavy blade in my hands. There's no justice in this world, Teach.
Claude: Ugh, the rain is really coming down now. Let's finish this quickly.
^end

@Opening 
A group of thieves led by a disowned son of House Gautier has stolen a Hero's Relic and begun to run amok. Seeking to neutralize this threat, the church is sending your house there to settle the matter.

@Battle 
Gilbert: The enemy is close by. We're almost to the top floor.

Edelgard: They have nowhere left to flee, so the situation is in our favor. All we have to do is chase then down.

Dimitri: They are merely thieves, but they have a Hero's Relic. Do not drop your guard.

Claude: Phew, why did we have to climb so high before a battle? At least it's better than fighting in heavy rain.

Sylvain: Don't hold back for my sake. My brother is going to pay for everything he's done.

Rogue: The captain's in trouble! Hurry up, you fools!
Gilbert: Enemies approach from the lower floor! Watch the rear flank!

Rogue: Here we go! Attack them from both sides!
Gilbert: It's an ambush!

@Boss 
Miklan: So, you think you can take the lance from me, huh? I'll kill you... I'll kill every last one of you!

%Sylvain,Miklan
Miklan: Why have you come, you Crest-bearing fool?
Sylvain: I'm here for the Lance of Ruin, Miklan. Hand it over. I don't want to humiliate you, but I will.
Miklan: Hmph! Hurry up and die already. If not for you... If it hadn't been for you...
Sylvain: Shut up! I'm so tired of hearing that. You've always blamed me for something that isn't my fault.

@Cutscene 
Miklan: Not bad for your kind... A bunch of spoiled rotten children.

Miklan: What the hell?!

Bandit: Damn! Look at that... I'm outta here!
Bandit: Hold on!

Bandit: No!

@Battle 
Black Beast: Graaaargh!
Sylvain: What theâMiklan?! Is that you?!

Sothis: That form... Oh my. Is this your first time fighting such a thing? Then listen well to what I say.

Edelgard: Such is the fate of one whose life is corrupted by a Crest Stone... How pitiable. The least we can do is put an end to his suffering.

Dimitri: So, this is the power of a Hero's Relic. To create such a sinister beast... It has gone too far. I fear all we can do now is put an end to it.

Claude: How awful...So the Heroes' Relics are hiding such a terrible power within. I can't even tell friend from foe anymore. I feel for him, but...the best we can do now is finish this quickly.

Sothis: An evil power has caused them to grow quite large. Their life force is beyond a mortal like yourself. You cannot win unless you fell them twice or even thrice!

Sothis: Even if you've cornered one, you cannot let your guard down! Those things are even worse when threatened.

Sothis: Can you see that barrier? It is surrounded by great power. You must break through to fight that thing. A strong attack or gambit might help to break through more quickly. If you can break the barrier, that power will have nowhere else to go, and that will likely cause confusions for that thing. It cannot counter while confused, which means that is the best time to attack!

Sothis: If you break down all of their barriers, not only will they be confused, they will not be able to move for a short while. Without the power flowing around them, they will not be able to restore their barriers. You might even be able to get something from them.

Sothis: They have such might that they will not fear you alone. But a battalion could prove useful on that front... Attack them with a gambit to draw their attention and force them to target you.

Sothis: Be on your guard when they have realized their full power! The damaged caused at times like that is not contained to just one spot. Once they have charged some power ups, their barriers will be restored. You really must pay close attention to those things! Distract them with a gambit, or just take them down before they can attack. In any case, think carefully before you act!

Sothis: But you should be conquering that thing instead of talking to me! If you're out of questions, get over there and fight!

@Boss 
%Sylvain,Black Beast
Sylvain: What is that? It's like watching a bad dream come to life.
Black Beast: Graaaargh!

@End 
Gilbert: Goddess... The beast is gone, yet Miklan and the Lance remain.

Edelgard: It is done. Let's retrieve the lance and depart at once.

Dimitri: It's over... Let's retrieve the lance and leave this place.

Claude: We defeated him, somehow... Let's grab the lance and return to the monastery.

Sylvain: Miklan...my brother...

Sothis: That man... His form was changed. It was as though that lance was swallowing him whole. Upon that sight, it makes sense that your students were upset. I wonder if those Relics truly hide such power? Yet even still, that power seems familiar. That form as well... As one who wields the Sword of the Creator... Does that mean you possess that power too?

Rhea: Professor, you have returned. The goddess is indeed generous with her divine protection. I have already heard Gilbert's report about what happened. See to it that you keep what transpired at the tower to yourself. People would lose faith in the nobles should rumors spread of one using a Relic and transforming into a monster. All regions of FÃ³dlan would fall into chaos. We must avoid that at all costs. Please ensure the students who accompanied you understand that as well. Have I made myself clear?
Byleth: Yes, of course. 
Byleth: Hm...
Rhea: His transformation into a Black Beast was nothing short of divine punishment from the goddess. Punishment for someone arrogant and foolish enough to use a Hero's Relic even though they were unworthy and unqualified.
Byleth: You knew?
Rhea: Of course. That is why we rushed to recover it. Sadly, we did not arrive in time.
Byleth: Will I share the same fate...
Rhea: If someone without a Crest were to wield the Relic you possess, they would likely meet the same fate as Miklan. You, however, have been chosen. You are worthy of wielding the Sword of the Creator, so there is no need to worry.
Rhea: The church will formally return the lance to House Gautier. If you would...
Byleth: As you wish. 
Rhea: You have my gratitude. I can see that I was right to trust you with this. Please report back. I will tell you of your new mission for the coming moon at that time.
Byleth: I will not. 
Rhea: What is the meaning of this?
Sylvain: Ahem, excuse me.  Lady Rhea, I am overjoyed and beyond grateful to you for recovering the Relic of my family, House Gautier. Now, may I please have that lance? I have received direct approval from my father to take possession of it.
Rhea: As the next head of House Gautier, do you swear that you will never cause such a deplorable incident to transpire?
Sylvain: On my family's name...and on my brother's life, I swear it.
Rhea: Very well. However, I have one condition. You must never allow another to wield this lance. Your brother clearly demonstrated what fate awaits those who break that restriction.
Sylvain: Yes. I...I will not soon forget.

^start 
Edelgard: I assume the archbishop was pleased with your performance. Did you return the Lance of Ruin?
Byleth: I returned it.
Edelgard:  No need to lie, Professor. I saw Sylvain earlier. It was written all over his face. 
Byleth: I did not return it.
Edelgard:  I'm glad. Sylvain must be overjoyed as well. 
Edelgard:  There's no need to lie, Professor. No one could have expected you to disobey the archbishop.
Edelgard: I keep thinking about what Gilbert told us...
Byleth: About Miklan?
Byleth: About House Gautier?
Edelgard: Yes, Miklan was discarded by his family because he was born without a Crest. Eventually he became a masterful thief and gathered enough ruffians to capture a fortress. Right or wrong, he was a gifted leader. He could have been a great asset to FÃ³dlan. What a waste. It's true that a Crest can increase your magical abilities and allow you to wield the full might of a Hero's Relic. But one cannot measure a leader's worth based solely on whether or not they bear a Crest. There are plenty of talented people in this world without one.
Byleth: I completely agree.
Byleth: Why is everyone obsessed with Crests?
Edelgard: People believe Crests are blessings from the goddess, that they're necessary to maintain order in FÃ³dlan. But the people are wrong. Crests are to blame for this brutal, irrational world we live in. Their power is granted only to a select few, whom we elevate and allow to rule the world. Have you ever wondered if the only way to create a truly free world is to dispense with the goddess and the Crests? Do that, and people will have no choice but to rise and fall by their own merits.
Hubert: Lady Edelgard. I question whether you revealed too much to the professor.
Edelgard: Perhaps I did.
Hubert: It is true that our teacher possesses a rare talent. Even I cannot deny it. The ability to wield the Sword of the Creator is concerning...
Edelgard: I've already explained this to you. My power alone is insufficient. That's why I'm borrowing power from those people. If our teacher can wield it in my stead... I believe that would be for the best.
Hubert: It's a risk. A dangerous one. You leave me no choice but to take matters into my own hands. Please excuse me.
Edelgard: I can't hide from the truth. I can't do all that I must on my own. If all I can rely on is my own ambition, my path won't be easy. Is it so risky...to reach out my hand? Father... I swear I will not stop until I succeed. My regret. My grief. My whole life. I've thrown it all away...into the darkness...

Dimitri: Is your meeting over, Professor?
Byleth: You look troubled.
Byleth: Are you weary?
Dimitri: I was just thinking about something. Professor... The possession of Relics and Crests has been highly valued in Faerghus since ancient times. It's far from uncommon for someone to lose their ability to lead their house because they don't bear a Crest. Just like Miklan. It happened to my uncle as well. The eldest child of the king, and yet he never ascended to the throne. All families whose bloodlines carry Crests of the 10 Elites are much the same. But House Gautier takes it a step further, and absolutely requires an heir who possesses a Crest.
Byleth: Why are they so obsessed with it?
Byleth: Why House Gautier in particular?
Dimitri: To that house, the power of Crests is a necessity, not a luxury. House Gautier holds the most northern territory in the Kingdom, and they have fought with the people to the north for many years. The head of that house is responsible for protecting that territory from fearsome invaders, whom they keep at bay with the power of Crests and Relics. In exchange for that responsibility, they are granted special privileges within the Kingdom.
Byleth: Their Crests grant them special privileges?
Dimitri: In a way. That said, ability cannot be measured by the possession of a Crest alone...
Byleth: Strength is strength, with or without a Crest.
Dimitri: I believe the same. Ability cannot be measured by the possession of a Crest alone.
Dimitri: I believe that Margrave Gautier was wrong to disinherit Miklan because he did not bear a Crest. Still, there is always a reason for why such customs stand the test of time. Imagine what this world would be like if no one placed any stock in Crests... Bloodlines that carry Crests would dwindle. The metaphorical blade used to oppose threats would eventually rest. This same argument has been made time and time again across the years. Both sides are at once right and wrong.
Byleth: What do you believe, Dimitri?
Dimitri: I believe those with Crests and those without should acknowledge the others' strengths and learn to respect each other based on personal merits. And that doesn't apply only to Crests. The same holds true for lineage, race, faith, ideologies... If we could just accept each other and make mutual concessions, one step at a time... Perhaps... Who knows if that's even possible. Everyone has something that is unacceptable within them. I certainly do, and I'd wager you do as well. I wonder which is best, Professor... To cut away that which is unacceptable, or to find a way to accept it anyway...

Claude: Nice work, Teach. It's thanks to you that we successfully completed our mission. As for Miklan... I wonder if he really believed he could wield a Relic.
Byleth: Hard to say.
Claude: I bet he just wanted to get his hands on it, even though he knew he couldn't use it.
Byleth: I doubt it.
Claude: Agreed. He probably just wanted to get his hands on it, even though he knew it was futile.
Claude: Though I'm sure he wasn't counting on turning into a monster like that... I wonder if that monster represents another aspect of the Heroes' Relics. What a strange and terrifying power.
Byleth: I don't know.
Byleth: It seems so.
Tomas: Stories of misfortune have followed the Heroes' Relics since ancient times.
Claude: Tomas! You've caught me by surprise. That's not easy to do. Though I suppose I should've expected to see our librarian in his library.
Tomas: I am sorry to intrude. I simply heard you speaking of the Heroes' Relics. I can tell you more about them, if you'd like. The story goes that Nemesis was corrupted by evil because of the Sword of the Creator. Other Heroes also lost themselves by continuing to use the Relics...transforming into Black Beasts with twisted souls. There used to be a great many records regarding the dark history of the Relics.
Claude: Used to be?
Tomas: They have been destroyed, across all of FÃ³dlan. Stripped from their shelves, including those that resided at this very library.
Claude: You make it sound like the church is covering up the truth. But now that you mention it, Rhea was very specific about not wanting anyone to find out what happened at Conand Tower. Hey Tomas... why are you telling us all this?
Tomas: It seemed like you were searching for answers about the Relics. What is a librarian if not a guide in the search for knowledge. And not only have you been searching, but you have been doing so through the night. I would suggest you stop before the knights notice. And that is enough meddling for today. Please excuse me.
Claude: So I've been found out, have I? I suppose I do spend more time at the library than most students. But I won't stop. I can't afford to.
Byleth: What are you after?
Claude: Teach... You don't really expect me to tell you something so personal like that, do you? Though, I wouldn't mind sharing if you were to tell me some of your secrets in exchange...
Edelgard: I can't let this exchange pass without comment... If you're sharing secrets, perhaps I can share one as well?
Claude: Are you sure you could survive that? I'd say you're the least likely to share secrets out of everyone at the academy.
Edelgard: Heh heh, coming from you, I'll take that as a compliment. After all, you're easily the student with the most secrets.
Claude: I'm afraid you overestimate me. My secrets don't amount to much. But back to Teach...
Edelgard: Don't try to change the subject, Claude. We're talking about secrets. Yours. Who is your father? And why did you appear so suddenly, as if from nowhere? Duke Riegan's eldest son died in an accident. Having tragically lost other family members as well, he was without an heir. The Alliance would undoubtedly have been shaken if House Riegan had lost its position of leadership. But then you showed up. Why did you return to House Riegan? What brought you to the monastery?
Byleth: I would like to hear this as well. 
Byleth: He doesn't have have to answer to you. 
Claude: Alas...to be surrounded by women as lovely as flowers, only to be pricked by their thorns.
Claude: My dream, in truth, is a selfless dream. But I require power to make it a reality. When I learned about the power of my Crest, I knew I had a chance. So I'm chasing that dream. To the bitter end, if need be. I came to this monastery because I thought I might find someone useful. Someone to help me on my path. So, what do you think? If you promise to help me achieve my dream no matter what, I'll promise to tell you anything.
Edelgard:  I have my own dream to tend to. I pray that yours does not interfere with mine.
Claude: What about you, Teach?
Byleth: If it's a noble dream... 
Byleth: That may be difficult.
Claude: I see. Well, now isn't the time to discuss this. You are still my Teach, after all.
^end

Rhea: Professor, you have done well to complete such a difficult task. You have shown exceptional skill in leading your students. I am forever grateful for the safe return of the Hero's Relic. Just as I expected, you have mastered the Sword of the Creator. Now then, I shall tell you about your mission for the coming month...
Seteth:  Rheâ Archbishop!
Rhea: Seteth, what troubles you?
Seteth: Flayn is missing! I cannot find her anywhere!  Professor, have you seen Flayn recently?
Byleth: I have not.
Seteth: I have searched everywhere! Where could she be?!
Byleth: Have you looked everywhere?
Seteth: I have searched every corner I can think of! I could not find her anywhere.
Seteth: She may be in danger! Oh no... No, no! What am I to do?!
Rhea: Calm yourself, Seteth. Professor, we shall continue our discussion another time.

@Opening 
As the sun grows stronger and the nights grow ever shorter, the Blue Sea Star returns to the sky once more. Believed to be the goddess's home, her followers look to the star and commence celebrations of her rebirth. On the grounds of Garreg Mach Monastery, a grand ceremony is held in honor of this much anticipated event. Every true follower of the Church of Seiros is sure to be in attendance.

@Dialogue
^start
Edelgard: Our mission this month is to patrol and set up defenses to stop the assassination plot.
Hubert: I wonder if an assassination attempt is truly the goal of our enemy...
Byleth: What do you mean?
Edelgard: You must sense that something's off about all of this.
Byleth: It's a distraction. 
Edelgard: Yes, I think so too.
Edelgard: A barely concealed secret message, trying to distract us from whatever's really going on. Sloppy, to say the least. And while everyone is out searching for a phantom assassin, they'll be free to accomplish their true goal with ease.
Ferdinand: The monastery houses many valuable weapons. Perhaps that is their aim?
Dorothea: I hear the monastery has a treasure vault too. Seems like the sort of place a foe would like some alone time in.
Linhardt: Garreg Mach is immense, and not just above ground but below as well. Perhaps their aim lies beneath the monastery...
Hubert: It seems to me that we should search the monastery for a clue as to what the enemy might be after. Of course, we must never underestimate the need for preparedness, in case a battle should ensue.
Shamir: A secret meeting, Professor? Oh, we haven't been introduced. I am Shamir.
Edelgard: Shamir is one of the Knights of Seiros. And this young man is-

Dimitri: So, our task for this moon is to patrol and guard the monastery, to help put a stop to that assassination plot. The knights will certainly have their hands full protecting Lady Rhea. Perhaps our enemy is counting on that...
Byleth: What do you mean?
Dedue: Your Highness, I am curious as to what you mean by that.
Byleth: I agree. 
Dedue: Please, elaborate.
Dimitri: Why would Lord Lonato be carrying around a secret note with an assassination plot written on it? Isn't it possible he hoped to monopolize everyone's attention with this alleged plot...in order to distract from his true aim?
Annette: Maybe they're after the treasure vault. There's also lots of valuable stuff in the library and Professor Hanneman's quarters!
Felix: True. The monastery undoubtedly houses many weapons that rival even the Heroes' Relics.
Sylvain: Whatever their aim, we can't allow any harm to come to the ladies of the monastery. I mean, what would I do with my spare time?
Dedue: You mean to say we should search the monastery. Try to find what the enemy is truly after.
Dimitri: Yes. And we should be prepared to fight them as well, should it come to that. I wouldn't mind getting in some training, just in case.
Shamir: A secret meeting, Professor? Oh, we haven't been introduced. I am Shamir.
Dimitri: Shamir is one of the Knights of Seiros. And this young man here isâ

Claude: OK... So our task this moon is to patrol and guard the monastery in support of the knights, who are busy trying to stop an assassination plot. Here's the thing. I don't think the bad guys are really trying to assassinate the archbishop.
Byleth: What do you mean?
Claude: Come on, Teach. Don't you think that "secret" note Lord Lonato was carrying around was just a little too obvious?
Byleth: It's a distraction. 
Claude: Precisely. That "secret note" with the assassination plot on it... There's just no way that was real.
Claude: People don't just carry around secret notes. Someone wanted us to find it.
Ignatz: Do you really think the assassination plot is just a distraction?
Hilda: Oh, yeah. That makes complete sense. But then...what are they really after?
Claude: If I knew that, I wouldn't be so worried. Let's see... It probably involves somewhere that will be empty during the Rite of Rebirth, yeah?
Lysithea: Since the ceremony is at the Goddess Tower, it follows that everywhere else at the academy will be severely understaffed.
Leonie: Do you think they're after the church's donation money? I hear noble families tend to donate quite generously.
Raphael: My bet's on the dining hall. It's a treasure trove of delicious food. Makes me angry just thinking about them getting their grubby hands on it!
Hilda: Let's split up and look around! I'll keep an eye on the reception hall.
Claude: You should get in some training if you have the time, Hilda. There's a good chance we'll have to fight.
Hilda: Uh! Well, I'm not the only one who needs to train here! It's not right to single me out like that.
Shamir: A secret meeting, Professor? Oh, we haven't been introduced. I am Shamir.
Claude: Shamir is one of the Knights of Seiros. And that little go-getter there isâ
^end
Cyril: I work for Lady Rhea! And I'm Shamir's apprentice! Oh, the name's Cyril.
Byleth: You work for Rhea?
Cyril: Yep. I help Lady Rhea with all kinds of stuff.
Byleth: Shamir's apprentice?
Cyril: Yep. She's teaching me about the bow and the sword and all kinds of stuff.
Cyril: I've gotta protect Lady Rhea, so that's why I've gotta learn all I can from Shamir.
Shamir: Cyril adores Rhea. That aside, if you need anything, ask.

@Conversation 
Sothis: A Hero's Relic...
Byleth: Do you know something? 
Sothis: However could I know something? Still, it is heavy on my mind.
Byleth: It represents great power.
Sothis: Quite so.
Sothis: The stone within the sword... A glow of red... Hm? Oh, it is nothing.





Edelgard: Our enemy's true target... What could it be? The monastery has been around for nearly a millennium. It's only logical that there are secrets here. We'd better investigate. Would you mind asking around and seeing what you can dig up? Once you've uncovered some leads, we'll regroup.

Edelgard: We need more information. Is there anyone else you could talk to?

Edelgard: Hmm... There's a place that the church values above all others. On the day of the rite, it will be open to the public. That will make it much easier than usual to access.
Byleth: The greenhouse?
Edelgard: You must be joking.
Byleth: The Holy Mausoleum?
Edelgard: Precisely.
Byleth: The dining hall?
Edelgard: You must be joking.
Edelgard: We can't know for certain, but it's a distinct possibility that the Holy Mausoleum is our enemy's target.



Edelgard: Oh, have you been tasked with guarding the monastery as well? Such a stir over a single letter...but I suppose the archbishop's safety is too important to risk.





Dimitri: If the enemy's aim lies elsewhere, we had better discern their true intent quickly. As I see it, our best option is to explore every inch of the monastery. We should also speak to everyone here. Let's plan to compare notes once you've got a lead.

Dimitri: Hmm. I'm afraid we'll need more information than that. Is there anyone else you could try speaking to?

Dimitri: So... There is something that the church values above all else. On the day of the rite, it will be open to the public. That will make gaining entry far easier than usual. You know the place of which I speak...
Byleth: The greenhouse?
Dimitri: Whatever would make you think that? This is no time for games, Professor.
Byleth: The Holy Mausoleum?
Dimitri: Yes, that is the most likely possibility.
Byleth: The dining hall?
Dimitri: Whatever would make you think that? This is no time for games, Professor.
Dimitri: We do not know their objective, but there is a good chance that our enemy is planning to target the Holy Mausoleum.

Dimitri: All this talk of assassination plots... It brings back dark memories I prefer to keep buried. I doubt there is any correlation, and yet... Ah, it is nothing. I am sorry for allowing my mind to wander. My focus should be solely on guarding the monastery right now.

Claude: To figure out our foe's intentions, we need information. Lot's of it. Or any, at the least. For now, try going around the monastery and looking for suspicious locations. You should also try chatting folks up to see if they know anything. Once we've got things narrowed down, let's meet up and compare notes.

Claude: Hmm... We still don't have enough to go on, Teach. Let's try looking around a little more.

Claude: Hmm. Something the church values above all else... And on the day of the rite, it'll be open to the public, making it easier than ever to get inside. That's gotta be it, right?
Byleth: The greenhouse?
Claude: That would be a resounding no.
Byleth: The Holy Mausoleum?
Claude: Bullseye.
Byleth: The dining hall?
Claude: That would be a resounding no.
Claude: We don't know the enemy's intentions, not yet. But our best bet is that their target will be the Holy Mausoleum.

Claude: There's been talk of an attempt on Rhea's life. We've been order to help the knights patrol. Could that possibly mean that Rhea isn't beloved by everyone the world over?

Hubert: Can you imagine the archbishop being murdered? I prefer not to consider such a gruesome scenario.
Byleth: Of course not. 
Hubert: Awfully calm, aren't you? I wonder what it takes to rile you up.
Byleth: Frightening thought.
Hubert: That easy to get under your skin, is it?

Ferdinand: Hmm... Setting fire to the stables to distract everyone, to cause a commotion. It is the oldest trick in the book, but I cannot shake the thought that our enemies may attempt it... I will stand guard and watch over the stable...and the knights' horses. They are truly magnificent.



Linhardt: So sleepy... Too sleepy... I found an interesting book in the library. Got so caught up reading it I forgot to sleep... Interesting discovery thoughâthe coffins of the Four Saints in the sanctum each have their Crests carved into them. I'll need to find a way down there to get a look.



Caspar: Oh. Hey, Professor. I was just reading this letter from my father. Do you know him? He's a pretty big deal in the Empire. He only writes to ask how my training's going, or how many monsters I've killed. Stuff like that.

Bernadetta: Um... Hi. Right now is, um... Well, right now's OK I guess. If you, um, want to chat...a little.
Byleth: Didn't I see you in the dining hall last night?
Bernadetta: Hey, I get hungry sometimes. Like anyone else! What? Eating at night is bad for you? There's no way that's true. Wait, really?


Dorothea: People die in every battle. And it can be by sword or spear or magic, but... But depending on who it is that died... Depending on who died, it's different.
Byleth: What do you mean?
Byleth: It's different if it's someone you know who was lost... 
Dorothea: I hope nothing bad happens this month.

Dorothea: Is it true you got caught in the fighting? I'm so thankful you made it out alive. I don't know what we would do if we lost you...




Petra: In Brigid... assassinations are many. I have also been the targeted back in the past.
Byleth: How frightening.
Byleth: I'm happy you survived. 
Petra: The Goddess Tower has an entrance of narrowness. That is most good. The windows are not the most good though. A target of ease for snipers.

Petra: Fighting to stop a murdering is my specialness...no, my specialty. I will show my best work!



Dedue: The monks declined my offer of assistance. They said that no one from Duscur is to be trusted, especially now. Given the circumstances, I cannot fault them.



Felix: Sending an assassin to the monastery, hm? Hopefully it's someone worth crossing blades with.
Byleth: I hope so too. 
Felix: It seems we're cut from the same cloth.
Byleth: I hope we can avoid bloodshed.
Felix: You're entitled to your opinion.


Felix: Lord Lonato's rebellion may have been quelled, but the unrest in Faerghus isn't dying down anytime soon. The boar prince should hurry up and claim the throne, rather than letting old customs hold him back.


Ashe: I can't stop thinking about Lonato... I'm sorry, Professor. I know this isn't the time, but... I just can't get past it.
Byleth: There's nothing to be done.
Byleth: Pull yourself together. 
Ashe: Thank you. No matter what happens, I promise you I'll do my part. I checked on my brother and sister who were living in Castle Gaspard. Thankfully they're all right. I was worried because they're both so young, but the church in the castle town offered to take them in. That much, at least, is a big relief.



Sylvain: No classes on a festival day! I thought I'd get to spend all day relaxing in the company of some lovely ladies, but now this has happened. Hey, Professor, I know there's talk of an assassination attempt, but do you really think they'll do it on the day of the Rite of Rebirth? I feel like security would be looser some other time. Is there some reason why it has to happen on that day?



Mercedes: The monastery holds many treasures. Maybe the enemy is after one of those? Even so, the idea of stealing from the church is just horrible...



Annette: I bought the ingredients for making some sweet treats I can't wait to eats! Huh? Oh! I know it looks like I'm fooling around, but I'm not. I'm preparing for potential battle during my patrol by making sure I have plenty of food I can eat while walking. Smart, huh?
Byleth: Good thinking. 
Annette: I know! Once they're ready, I promise to share some with you.
Byleth: You're making patrol sweets?
Annette: I just thought I'd be more alert if I had something sweet in my tummy. Oh, wait! Was it spicy food that you liked, Professor?



Annette: Have you heard? Rumor has it that death himself has been appearing in Garreg Mach. They say he appears every night and kidnaps folks. I wonder what happens to them...




Ingrid: Professor, while the investigation is important, don't forget to make time for your training. If we have to battle and cannot win, all will be lost. We don't know who our enemy is, so we must be prepared for anything.

Ingrid: Lady Rhea lifts the spirits of all the people of FÃ³dlan. We cannot allow her to come to any harm.


Lorenz: Are we really just taking Claude's word for it? If so, I doubt anything will come of this. It is all probably just some sort of distasteful joke. I find it highly unlikely that anyone would be foolish enough to barge in here and cause a disturbance.

Lorenz: The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is the most significant ritual for the Church of Seiros. Could it be that someone has spread these rumors of an assassination plot merely with the intention to hinder the celebration?


Raphael: I bet the enemy's using this assassination nonsense just to sneak in and raid the pantry. What do you think, Professor?
Byleth: You may be right. 
Raphael: Oh, I'm right all right. My animal instinct is telling me that the enemy is after our best meats.
Byleth: I don't think so.
Raphael: You don't think so? Then dinner's on you if it turns out I was right!


Ignatz: The monastery's so big. How can we narrow down the list of possible targets? The only places I can think of are the vault and the library, and... I guess that's it.



Ignatz: With the whole monastery preparing for the Goddess's Rite of Rebirth this month, it feels like everyone's a little on edge...



Lysithea: I don't know who to blame for all this commotion, but it's frankly a huge inconvenience. With everyone stuck on guard duty, our study and training time has been drastically reduced.
Byleth: Some things are more important than that. 
Lysithea: Yes, yes, I understand that. But it doesn't change the fact that it's a royal pain.
Byleth: I agree--it's very inconvenient.
Lysithea: Indeed. For now, let's do all we can to find and dispose of our enemy.



Marianne: It seems there were forces opposing the church, beyond Lord Lonato... I never thought such forces could exist in this world.
Byleth: It makes sense that the church has enemies.
Marianne: I don't understand. What would they have against the church?
Byleth: We only know a small part of this world. 
Marianne: I suppose that may be true...




Hilda: Hello! I'm in charge of managing all records for the Golden Deer House. Oh, but I don't have any information of note right now. Go ahead and continue your investigation. And put a little extra effort into it, please!



Hilda: Did you know that, on the last day of the rite, the monastery's open to the general public? It's kinda fun. It makes the place feel like a festival.


Leonie: Seems like donations to the monastery aren't actually kept here. That means the enemy isn't likely to be interested in money. We should turn our attention elsewhere. Then again, I guess some of the plants in the greenhouse could sell for a lot. But that can't really be it, can it?




Leonie: Hey, did you hear? A knight wielding a scythe is roaming around town at night. If he's a villain, I'd like to get the measure of him.



Rhea: Hmm... Might you have come looking for me because you were worried about my safety?
Byleth: I was worried. 
Rhea: I am quite all right. But your concern means a great deal.
Byleth: The enemy could have other objectives.
Rhea: I am aware of the possibility. On the day of the ceremony, I am trusting that you will not allow your attention to wander or wane.



Seteth: I've been in town, procuring some supplies for Flayn.
Byleth: Did you encounter any danger? 
Seteth: No, but do not concern yourself for my safety. I am very much stronger than I appear.
Byleth: What supplies?
Seteth: Nothing out of the ordinary. Do not trouble yourself over it.



Flayn: Professor... I am afraid I have acted a bit childishly toward my brother recently... Given the circumstances, I requested that he provide me with some candies... Silly of me, really. The timing was improper, and I regret it very much now. Oh, but more importantly, this place is off limits, Professor. It is only open to the public on the day of the Goddess's Rite of Rebirth.



Alois: Have you visited the Goddess Tower? It's a sacred place, used for rituals and the like. In general, students aren't allowed entry. But as you'd expect, that rule just excites their curiosity. Some have even tried sneaking in. Well, at least for this month, that kind of behavior is totally unthinkable. We have a lot more security, what with the Goddess's Rite of Rebirth coming up.




Catherine: You'd best keep your distance. In this nervous state, I might just cut you down.
Byleth: Please don't.
Byleth: I dare you to try. 
Catherine: Oh, come on. I'm only kidding!

Catherine: Hey, Professor. You're good-looking, you know that? At the same time, you look like someone who was born to fight. I bet we'd get along. I'm also good-looking and born to fight, heh? Need any help with your class?

Catherine: Feel free to call on me when a fight's brewing. Thunderbrand and I will be there when you need us.


Shamir: You spend too much time roaming the monastery. If you're looking for something, try less aimless wandering.
Byleth: I was thinking about the enemy's objective. 
Shamir: Do you even know who the enemy is? You can't know why without knowing who.
Byleth: I'm not looking for anything.
Shamir: Sure.
Shamir: It's none of my business anyway. I'm just here to take care of enemies who get too close.



Jeritza: You're skilled. Why won't you battle me? Hmph.



Jeralt: What's the matter? You're running all over creation. Ah... You don't believe Lady Rhea is the real target, do you? Even so, the knights have their orders. We can't abandon our duty to guard Lady Rhea. The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is an important event for the Church of Seiros. They say it's the day when the goddess will return to walk among us. Not too likely, if you ask me. Uh... Best if you keep that to yourself.



Hanneman: Unbelievable. What a terrifying story. However, an assassination attempt on Lady Rhea is doomed to fail. Pardon? You think the goal may be different than simple assassination? Intriguing. I suppose the priceless objects in this room could perhaps draw thieves. However, there's no one but me who could make use of them...




Manuela: Professor. I hope you're well. As for me, I had a date with a splendid specimen of a knight. But now he's suddenly not in the mood to see me again. I blame all these rumors of a deathly figure showing up in town. Such an uproar must have, beyond reason, drawn his attention away from me.



Tomas: I hear you have fought alongside Catherine. I would wager that her power exceeded your expectations. Had you the chance to witness her Relic? Thunderbrand, glowing red... That glow is a sure sign that her blood contains a Crest that harmonizes with that Hero's Relic.



Cyril: Excuse me, Professor? I just wanted to let you know that Lady Rhea is always real concerned with you. She expects great things, I think. Please don't let her down, OK?
Byleth: Of course not. 
Cyril: I hope you're not just saying that.
Byleth: We'll see...
Cyril: Ya know what? I'm watching you.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is this month, right? The monastery gates will be thrown wide open on that day! I'll be working as a guide. I hope I get to guide some lovely ladies around... Heh heh...



Squire: The goddess's home is in the sky! She lives on a bright and shining star! But in the spring, you can't see that star. That means she can't protect FÃ³dlan. That's why we all celebrate the day when her star returns to the sky! That's the day of the Rite of Rebirth! See, see? I've been studying! I know just about everything!



Knight of Seiros: People seem to think that all the Knights of Seiros are equal, but that isn't quite so. There are many distinguishing ranks within the order. For example, there are squires, who are training to become knights, as well as full knights, like myself. Oh, and then we have the holy knights, such as Catherine. Those are the knights that can wield a Hero's Relic.



Priest: About 20 or so years ago there was a big fire in Garreg Mach. On that day, Captain Jeralt went missing. Everyone thought he was dead... It never occurred to me that he might actually have survived. The truly strange part is that, in all those years, he hasn't changed a bit...



Knight of Seiros: On the day of the rite, the monastery will be open to the public, including the Holy Mausoleum. The Holy Mausoleum is where the tomb of the divine Seiros lies. There she slumbers, eternally. That's...pretty much all that in there. Just an ancient coffin. It's sealed with a powerful magic, to protect against would-be grave robbers.

Knight of Seiros: Have you heard of the War of the Eagle and Lion? It was the battle that won the Kingdom its independence from the Empire. Even the Church of Seiros had no choice but to recognize the courage of Loog, the King of Lions, who emerged victorious. The church awarded him a crown and the right to govern the Faerghus region, backing him in his bid to found the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus. In return, Loog agreed to make the Church of Seiros the religion of his territory, and permitted them to publicly proselytize across the Kingdom. In the 400 years since, the church and the Kingdom have continued to maintain very close relations.

Knight of Seiros: Something in the monastery that someone might go after? There's so much here I couldn't possibly name just one. Even this here kitchen contains previous wares. Wine bottles from centuries past and the like. I hear that stuff is fancy, but not very drinkable. I doubt anyone would go to the trouble of stealing it.

Monk: It would be terrible if the greenhouse was targeted. The plants in here are incredibly valuable. This place contains the heart of Garreg Mach's 995-year history! So many beautiful flowers... Plants that can save or end lives... They are all my precious children.

Knight of Seiros: I have heard talk of students wandering the monastery late at night. They wouldn't happen to be from your class, would they? Please keep your students in line, Professor. Kids these days...

Priest: Do you know what this room is? It is the church's treasure vault. I say treasure, but I do not mean silver and gold and jewels. It mostly contains weapons, artifacts, and the like. Anything that would cause too great a stir should it be stolen? No. The church knows better than to store anything too valuable in such an accessible location.

Monk: There are numerous books in this library that you cannot find anywhere else. But once you are here, you can read them easily enough. I doubt someone would go to the trouble of stealing one. Sometimes Seteth will dispose of books that are deemed inappropriate for the monastery, but that's about it. In a way, I suppose that makes those particular volumes more valuable... Right?

Monk: That boy who assists the archbishop... Cyril, I believe? I hear he's originally from a foreign land to the east called Almyra. I know he's still only a child, but I do wonder about his true intentions...

@Intro 
^start
Hubert: The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is about to begin. Are we going to move forward with our plan?
Edelgard: I believe so. How confident are you in our theory, Professor?
Byleth: We're not wrong.
Linhardt: No one's intuition is perfect. It's ridiculous not to have doubts.
Byleth: It could go either way.
Bernadetta: Oh, I don't like those odds at all...
Byleth: I'm a little doubtful...
Petra: You have little doubts? That is good. We have no room for big doubts on this day.
Hubert: All that matters is how our enemy makes their move, not how our teacher feels about our plan.
Seteth: You seem a mite too relaxed for my liking. The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is about to begin. While we are in the Goddess Tower, we are relying on you to secure the locations that are lacking in defense.
Flayn: May I let you in on something, Professor? My brother can be a bit...callous. He told me that he was concerned about you, and hinted that perhaps you would be better off patrolling a coffin!
Seteth: That was said in jest, Flayn. And in confidence. Please just remain by my side and do not cause any more trouble. As a professor, you would do well to remember that it is your duty to guide your students down the path of righteousness.
Flayn: Please excuse us, everyone. We shall see you again after the ceremony has concluded!
Hubert: A coffin. How fascinating.
Edelgard: Hurry, Professor. We must find a place to hide where we can guard the stairs to the Holy Mausoleum. If the enemy moves as predicted, we should be able to cut off their escape path and capture every last one of them.

Dimitri: The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is finally here. Let's move ahead with our plan.
Dedue: Leave it to me. Professor, Are you in as well?
Byleth: Of course.
Ingrid: We've narrowed down our objective...kind of. So, let's show everyone that we can carry out our duties better than anyone!
Byleth: I'm not sure about this.
Mercedes: Oh dear. Our professor seems to lack confidence in our plan. That is not very reassuring.
Byleth: I'm hungry.
Annette: Umm... Oh! Well, I'll be sure to whip you up some tasty treats when this is all over!
Dimitri: We're counting on you, Professor.
Seteth: You seem a mite too relaxed for my liking. The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is about to begin. While we are in the Goddess Tower, we are relying on you to secure the locations that are lacking in defense.
Flayn: May I let you in on something, Professor? My brother can be a bit...callous. He told me that he was concerned about you, and hinted that perhaps you would be better off patrolling a coffin!
Seteth: That was said in jest, Flayn. And in confidence. Please just remain by my side and do not cause any more trouble. As a professor, you would do well to remember that it is your duty to guide your students down the path of righteousness.
Flayn: Please excuse us, everyone. We shall see you again after the ceremony has concluded!
Dedue: It's time.
Dimitri: All right. Let's stick to the plan, and go hide where we can watch over the entrance to the Holy Mausoleum. If anyone suspicious enters, we'll follow them in and take them down. Got it?

Claude: The Rite of Rebirth is finally underway. Time to see if our hunch was right.
Hilda: Ugh, I hope it's not. Then we wouldn't have to fight anyone.
Byleth: Our hunch is right.
Ignatz: We've all come to this conclusion together. I'm sure we got it right.
Byleth: We are mistaken.
Lorenz: Do you really believe that, Professor? Claude certainly looks confident.
Byleth: Only the goddess knows.
Marianne: Dear Goddess... Please protect us...
Claude: Right or wrong, the clock is ticking. All we can do now is stick to the plan.
Seteth: You seem a mite too relaxed for my liking. The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is about to begin. While we are in the Goddess Tower, we are relying on you to secure the locations that are lacking in defense.
Flayn: May I let you in on something, Professor? My brother can be a bit...callous. He told me that he was concerned about you, and hinted that perhaps you would be better off patrolling a coffin!
Seteth: That was said in jest, Flayn. And in confidence. Please just remain by my side and do not cause any more trouble. As a professor, you would do well to remember that it is your duty to guide your students down the path of righteousness.
Flayn: Please excuse us, everyone. We shall see you again after the ceremony has concluded!
Hilda: Seteth is way too overprotective. He reminds me of my brother.
Claude: Come on, Teach. I know a hidden spot where we can monitor the stairs that lead to the Holy Mausoleum. If there's anyone down there, they'll be trapped like the rats they are. We'll just have to take them down without getting bitten.

@Opening 
While the plot to assassinate the archbishop shakes the monastery to its core, you suspect the enemy may have a different motivation. Anxiety abounds as the Goddess's Rite of Rebirth commences.

@Battle 
Edelgard: We were right. Unwanted gusts have come to visit.

Mysterious Mage: Those Central Church dastards have spotted us... Buy me some time while I open the seal on the casket!
Western Church Soldier: I'm on it.

Dimitri: It is as we suspected. The enemy is within.

Edelgard: Our enemy appears to be after the tomb of Saint Seiros in the back. Are they attempting to steal her bones? It would be best to defeat them before the achieve their aim.

Edelgard: Look closely... There are contraptions of some sort on the floor. We must pay attention to our enemies' weapons and advance while attacking them from advantageous positions.

Mysterious Mage: Death Knight! Prove your strength and scatter these fools!
Death Knight: I don't take commands. Or waste my time on weaklings.

Edelgard: That knight is a powerful enemy... Let's do all we can to avoid him.

Dimitri: The enemy is after the casket of Saint Seiros. Do they intend to steal her bones? We must defeat those enemies before they open the casket.

Dimitri: But look closely at the ground... There are contraptions of some sort in place. We'll have to look closely at the enemies' weapons and advance while attacking them from the best positions possible.

Dimitri: That knight looks like he has experience. It would be foolish to challenge him recklessly.

Claude: Our guess was spot on. Looks like we have company.

Claude: Looks like the enemy is going after the casket in the back. Maybe they're going after the saint's bones? Weird. I'd like to defeat them before they can finish the job.

Claude: But did you notice? Look closely at the ground. There's some kind of contraption on certain parts of the floor. The smart move is to advance while finding the best fighting positions we can based on the enemy's weaponry.

Claude: I'm getting a really disturbing vibe from that guy... No one go near the evil-looking knight, OK?

Mysterious Mage: The reinforcements haven't arrived?! If they approach from behind, we can attack them from both sides...

Mysterious Mage: It's no use! The seal is broken. You can'tâ Huh? A sword?

@Boss 
Death Knight: Like moths to a flame...

Death Knight: I told you that if you fled, I would not chase you. But it seems you wish to die...

Death Knight: I didn't expect to encounter someone like you... How fortunate.

Mysterious Mage: You're too late! The seal will be broken any minute now...

Mysterious Mage: It's no use! The seal is broken. You can'tâ Huh? A sword?

%Edelgard,Death Knight
Edelgard: There's no way around it... I accept your challenge!
Death Knight: Oh? This will be fun...

%Mercedes,Death Knight
Mercedes: Oh my, how frightening! Won't you please go easy on me?
Death Knight: You... Was this meeting...preordained?
Mercedes: Hmm? What do you mean?

@End 
Death Knight: That sword is...I see. What a pleasant surprise. 

Edelgard: Ugh, he got away! That sword... Why is it â
Hubert: That's the sword that was in the casket. Seems to be shimmering, almost as though...

Dimitri: He got away... We have no choice but to let them go for now. Professor... The way that sword is glowing. I wonder...

Claude: The jerk got away. Was that magic? We can't even chase after him. Hey, Professor. The way that sword is shining... Do you think it could be...

Catherine: Is the intruder here?! Oh... Looks like you have this under control. You! Round up any stragglers.
Knight of Seiros: Will do!

Seteth: As all of you have committed a breach of faith, the archbishop will now pass judgement.
Shamir: Inciting a Kingdom noble to rebel. Unlawful entry. The attempted assassination of the archbishop. An attack on the Holy Mausoleum. It is unnecessary to go on, followers of the Western Church.
Priest: What?! We have nothing to do with the Western Church!
Seteth: You have already been identified. Please spare us your second-rate theater.
Rhea: Dishonoring a holy ceremony is worthy of death for a member of the church. You are well past the hope of redemption. If you have any grace remaining, you will willingly offer your life as atonement for this crime.
Priest: No! This isn't what we were told would happen! We've been deceived!
Shamir: It's no use arguing. Whatever your excuse, the punishment stands.
Rhea: May your souls find peace as they return to the goddess...
Priest: Wait! Please! The goddess would never forgive you for our execution!
Priest: Monster! We know you've already slaughtered many of our fellow brethren like this!
Rhea: This concludes the investigation. Please remove these poor, lost souls from my sight.

^start 
Edelgard: That's that, I suppose. The assassination attempt, the attack on the Holy Mausoleum... It was all the Western Church's doing. That masked knight who led the attack somehow managed to disappear without a trace.
Hubert: The Church of Seiros clearly isn't as unified as it would hope to appear. It seems the bishop of the Western Church was always opposed to the church being ruled centrally from Garreg Mach. Perhaps they hope to remove the archbishop in order to completely strip the Central Church of its authority.
Byleth: The Western Church...
Byleth: The Central Church?
Edelgard: Ugh, that's right. Jeralt mentioned that you were raised without any exposure to the church. In order to function more efficiently, the Church of Seiros is split into several smaller entities. The Central Church is the largest and leads the organization from Garreg Mach.
Hubert: The Western Church extends from Castle Gaspard, where Lord Lonato rebelled into the far west. They can be found just beyond the most renowned stronghold of the Kingdom, the Fortress City of Arianrhod.
Edelgard: It seems the knights have been tasked with subduing the leaders of the Western Church. We may be give an opportunity to help them with their mission.
Hubert: To think...our own professor was born in FÃ³dlan and yet knew nothing of the church. I never imagined explaining something so basic to an instructor of mine. You're something of a special case, are you not?
Edelgard: How strange that the archbishop would ask someone like that to lead her students. There's clearly more to that decision than we know.
Caspar: Lady Rhea is pretty scary sometimes...but to execute that whole group just like that? It seems harsh, even for her.
Bernadetta: If one of us does something bad, I wonder what she would do to us!
Dorothea: Professor... Do you agree with the archbishop's actions?

Dimitri: There you have it... It seems that the assassination attempt and the attack on the Holy Mausoleum were all the work of the Western Church. As for the masked knight who led the attack... I'm afraid his whereabouts are yet unknown.
Dedue: It makes no sense that the Western Church would try such a thing.
Dimitri: It just goes to show that the Church of Seiros is not completely united. The church is led by those here in Garreg Mach, and the Western Church doesn't have a strong voice on its governing council. I imagine the Western Church has harbored some resentment towards the Central Church for a while now.
Byleth: The Western Church...
Byleth: The Central Church?
Dimitri: Ah, that's right. Jeralt did say that you grew up outside the influence of the church. The Church of Seiros is split into a few branches across FÃ³dlan. The largest being the Central Church, which is headquartered right here at Garreg Mach.
Dimitri: The Western Church lies far to the west of Castle Gaspard, where Lord Lonato held his rebellion. It's situated on the far side of the Kingdom's most impressive fortress, Arianrhod. I imagine the Western Church's intention was to eliminate Lady Rhea, and the Central Church's authority along with her. Naturally, the knights will be riding out to question the Western Church's top officials. Or rather...to punish them.
Dedue: When they do, Your Highness, we will likely be asked to carry out said punishment.
Dimitri: Indeed. Now, I don't mean to be rude, Professor, but I must say that your situation is rather unusual. For someone to grow up in FÃ³dlan and yet never have any contact with the Church of Seiros is...it's hard to believe.
Dedue: I wonder why the archbishop would hire someone like that as a professor...
Ashe: So...those people from the Western Church were... Um, Lady Rhea had them killed, didn't she?
Mercedes: Well, of course she did. Going against the teachings of Seiros like that. Quite unforgivable!
Ingrid: Those who stray must be punished, I suppose. That said... Professor, Iâ

Claude: I suppose that's that. The assassination attempt, the attack on the Holy Mausoleum... Looks like it was all a plot by the Western Church. It's just too bad that that masked knight who was leading the attack got away. Vanished without a trace.
Hilda: But why would the Western Church want to attack Lady Rhea?
Claude: Why? Take your pick of reasons. Relations with the Western Church aren't exactly friendly.
Byleth: The Western Church...
Byleth: What reasons?
Claude: Oh, that's right. Jeralt mentioned that you grew up completely isolated from the church. The Church of Seiros is split into a few different branches across FÃ³dlan. The Central Church is headquartered right here at Garreg Mach.
Claude: Then there's the Western Church. Far west from Castle Gaspard, where Lord Lonato had his little rebellion, is the Fortress City of Arianrhod. It's the strongest fortress in the Kingdom. On the other side of it is the headquarters of the Western Church.
Hilda: Not too smart to bicker with people who worship the same goddess as you.
Claude: The bishop of the Western Church must be pretty ambitious. Probably hopes to split off completely. In which case, he'd need to weaken the Central Church's influence. Killing Rhea is certainly one way to do that. To the shock of no one, I hear the knights have been sent to subdue the leaders of the Western Church. We'll probably get a chance to assist.
Hilda: You're an odd one, aren't you, Professor? How'd you make it this far in life without ever interacting with the church? I can't believe someone like you exists in FÃ³dlan. It's too strange!
Claude: If you think that's weird, consider the fact that Rhea hired Teach despite all that.
Raphael: So, those guys they caught... They all got the axe, right? That's brutal.
Lysithea: Lady Rhea can be rather intimidating at times. In fact...she can be downright terrifying.
Marianne: Professor. Those who cannot be saved must be delivered to the goddess for judgement. Is that not so?
^end

Seteth: There you are, Professor. It seems Lady Rhea would like a word with you. Come with me.

Lord Arundel: The archbishop lives. Not that I had ever placed much faith in those swine from the Western Church.
Flame Emperor: I have news, both good and bad. The remains of Seiros were not in the tomb. However, something else was. The Sword of the Creator.
Lord Arundel: Ah, the weapon wielded by that thief, the King of Liberation.
Flame Emperor: Thief? Hm. At any rate, it is now in the hands of the academy's new professor. I doubt you will be surprised to hear that the Crest Stone had already been removed from the sword when it was found.
Lord Arundel: Hmph. As expected. It would be foolish to keep both in the same location.
Flame Emperor: There's more. The professor was able to awaken the sword's true power. Even without the Crest Stone, the sword glowed red. The professor's Crest is compatible. There is no mistaking it.
Lord Arundel: Absurd. Using a Relic without its Crest Stone should be impossible... The King of Liberation's bloodline should not even... Hmm.
Flame Emperor: They must be allowed to keep it, for now. I do not have enough information about the professor to act. As for your request, I assent. The Death Knight is at your command. Use him well.
Lord Arundel: Good. I believe I will enjoy this a great deal...

@Dialogue 
Rhea: I cannot thank you enough for defeating those invaders in the Holy Mausoleum, and especially for protecting the Sword of the Creator. That sword is one of the Heroes' Relics, and the most precious artifact in the church's possession. It is also a weapon of terrifying power. For now...I will entrust the sword to you. Please, use it wisely.
Seteth: Lady Rhea, wait! Do you truly mean to give the Sword of the Creator to this stranger?! Surely it is not the sort of thing that one hands over so readily, even to someone who has the ability to wield it! If someone like Nemesis were to appear again, all of FÃ³dlan would be consumed by war!
Byleth: Nemesis?
Seteth: Nemesis, the King of Liberation. He is an ancient king of mankind who was defeated by Seiros over a thousand years ago. When FÃ³dlan was attacked by wicked gods, it is said that the goddess gifted Nemesis with the Sword of the Creator. Nemesis used that sword to defeat the wicked gods, saving all of FÃ³dlan. Henceforth he was dubbed the King of Liberation. However, his power began to corrupt him until he, himself, turned to the darkness. Saint Seiros was forced to destroy him. Lady Rhea, I beg you to reconsider. Given a little more time, we could more accurately assess this stranger's abilities.
Rhea: No. I have faith, Seteth. Faith that our friend here will not be corrupted by wickedness. Since the death of Nemesis, none have been able to wield the Sword of the Creator. Now, after all those long years of being sealed away, it has returned and found a new master.
Seteth: I...understand. As you wish, Lady Rhea. There you have it, Professor. See that you do not betray the trust the archbishop has seen fit to bestow upon you.

Sothis: The Sword of the Creator. The King of Liberation. Each tale is more confusing than the last! And I really can't read that Rhea at all... That sword is clearly precious... So why is she so keen to gift the thing to you?
Byleth: It certainly is strange. 
Byleth: The sword chose me.
Sothis: Is that a fact?
Sothis: I feel as though we have become entangled in a mystery... And there is one more thing that has been plaguing me. The Sword of the Creator... It somehow feels distinct from other Relics we have seen. Such as the one that... Oh goodness, what was her name? Ca... Cat...
Byleth: Catherine?
Sothis: Yes! Her!
Byleth: Cat?
Sothis: What is wrong with that head of yours? Of course it's not a cat! Her name is Catherine.
Sothis: The Sword of the Creator differs from her Thunderbrand in one key way. It bears a hole...where something should have been, but is no more. I despise not knowing what is going on! It...it frightens me. And yet... I place my trust in you. I must. Whatever comes to pass...please swear to cut a path that is your own.

Claude: The Sword of the Creator... Pulled right from the legends. I finally found it, and yet it ended up in Teach's hands. Could I even use it anyway? Damn it. There's no telling what's to come...
