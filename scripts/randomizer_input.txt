FE6|13-RescueMission|Percival|...I sort of recall seeing you at Lord Douglas’ manor...|neutral
FE9|13-AGuidingWind|Ike|Don't take it personally. I'm no better, you know. Your ability to speak plainly the things others won't is part of what makes you brilliant. Others are too bound by courtesy...With you, I trust that what you say is exactly what you think.|neutral
FE9|22-Solo|Mist|He's been like this from the moment he set foot in this room. He's just staring at the walls.|neutral
FE9|08-DespairAndHope|Mordecai|Lethe! You are being bad. The king forbids this. We cannot fight with beorc!|anger

FE9|11-BloodRunsRed|Soren|When the Daein army darkens their doorsteps, perhaps they will understand. When the peace they take for granted is shattered, and their sons and daughters slaughtered in the streets...Perhaps then will they comprehend the misfortunes they so long pretended not to see. I have no sympathy for them.|anger

FE9|25-StrangeLands|Soren|...Could it be...? I think I may finally know Ashnard's intentions.|surprise
FE9|11-BloodRunsRed|Ike|What's with this place? The people are going about their business. Why aren't they worried about Daein? About the war?|surprise
FE9|05-Flight|Ike|Why’s that?|surprise
FE9|09-Gallia|Ike|I see. Having a grasp of that is part of the commander’s job, too, right? Understood. Let me hear it.|neutral

FE9|12-AStrangeLand|Sothe|Owowow! Quit it! I'll talk!!|fear
FE9|27-MomentOfFate|Ike|It's supposed to. It was made to contest Alondite, which is the sword wielded by the Black Knight.|neutral
FE9|11-BloodRunsRed|Lady|Yeah! That's right! If we need allies, I'll take flesh-and-blood Daein humans over some fanged sub-human freak!|anger

FE9|15-TheFeralFrontier|Sigrun|Well, of course. Beorc and laguz are both living things. Every precious life was created to be equal by the blessed goddess. The fact that there are still those who persecute laguz in the land of the goddess... It is deplorable.|anger
FE9|08-DespairAndHope|Soren|Don’t worry. I’ll be here, watching over you.|neutral
Mark my words.|
FE9|20-DefendingTalrega|Mist|No! I always carry it with me! I would never lose it! I had it before I went to bed last night... It vanished while I was sleeping! Sniff...waaaa...|sadness
FE9|20-DefendingTalrega|Titania|Really? I never thought I'd hear that. Ike didn't sleep because he was thinking. I wonder if Soren will start being polite...|surprise

FE9|04-RoadsideBattle|Rhys|Are you feeling all right, Ike? You haven’t said a word in quite some time.|neutral
FE9|18-CrimeaMarches|Ike|Hmm... I suppose. Not that it matters to me.|neutral

FE9|15-TheFeralFrontier|Naesala|You came all this way for that? Are you serious?|surprise
FE9|16-TheAtonement|Reyson|Naesala, you wretch... Curse your eyes! How dare you do this to me...|anger
FE9|17-DayBreaks|Tibarn|This begging is unseemly and unwanted. We would rescue Reyson regardless of this pathetic show of tears. Return to Kilvas and report these events to your accursed king. Tell him that when this is over, King Tibarn of Phoenicis will be paying him a visit.|anger
FE9|11-BloodRunsRed|Woman|Get out of here! Monster!|fear
FE9|28-TwistedTower|Ike|Are you talking about the laguz that can't change forms? Like the ones we fought in Begnion?|neutral

FE9|26-Clash|Titania|Tell us, Soren, do you have any more information on General Bertram?|neutral
FE6|20A-TheLiberationOfIlia|Shanna|Yes! I became a Pegasus Knight because I wanted to be like you. Fighting alongside you is like a dream.|joy
FE9|13-AGuidingWind|Naesala|Those humans take themselves far too seriously. It's almost as though being obstinate is a way of life to them. They let their foolish pride stand in the way, and what do they get in the end? A swift and stupid death. Now I'm getting terribly bored merely watching their foolishness.|anger
FE9|15-TheFeralFrontier|Naesala|Here we are. This is what I wanted to show you. Look below you, Reyson. What do you see?|neutral
FE9|18-CrimeaMarches|Shinon|No! There's nothing! Nothing but the right price, at least... You're overestimating me. Get going, pretty boy. Stick around any longer, and I'll start earning my pay with you!|anger
FE9|11-BloodRunsRed|Norris|It's true! Princess Elincia...Ha ha!  My luck has changed.|joy

FE9|17-DayBreaks|Tibarn|I understand how you feel, but we're completely outnumbered. Let us wait for another day--|neutral
FE6|21-TheBindingBlade|Galle|...Goodbye, Melady... I always wish we had met in a more peaceful time.|sadness
FE6|24-TheTruthOfTheLegend|Jahn|Hate? Only humans have such ridiculous emotions. We battled to maintain our species, and we lost. That is all.|anger
FE9|22-Solo|Soren|Yes! We must! Have you forgotten Nasir?! It's that sort of naive attitude that allowed him to remain undetected for so long! You people don't seem to get it. We are at WAR! All doubts, no matter how small, must be extinguished. If they aren't, we could well be ignoring something that will lead to our defeat. Or to our death.|anger
FE9|28-TwistedTower|Naesala|Listen, and listen good. I don't want there to be any misunderstandings here. It was Tibarn! He forced me to do this. It wasn't any sense of charity or anything. It was a sort of...payment for the debt I had incurred.|neutral
FE9|02-Rescue|Rolf|Oh...sniff...|sadness
FE9|24-BattleReunion|Bastian|We've been attacked! Castle Delbray is surrounded by enemy troops!|fear

FE9|13-AGuidingWind|Ike|On her own? Now why would anyone called the apostle do something as stupid as that?|anger
FE9|04-RoadsideBattle|Soren|Bad news. Something big is happening, and we need to formulate a plan of action.|neutral
FE9|12-AStrangeLand|Ike|Are those...birds? If they are, they must be huge...|surprise
FE9|18-CrimeaMarches|Ulki|They're siding with Daein? Unbelievable!|surprise
FE9|05-Flight|Soren|We are mercenaries. Our actions are dictated only by self-interest. If we want to ensure our future, we need Daein in our debt. They will win this war, after all, and nothing else serves us better.|neutral
FE9|XX-Epilogue|Naesala|Pah! Keep your foolish tongue inside your foolish head! ...And don’t tell anyone! I have a reputation to think of.|anger
FE9|17-DayBreaks|Ike|It's about time you showed your bloated face, Duke Tanas!|anger

FE9|25-StrangeLands|Soren|At the very least, it is one of his ambitions. There can be no mistaking that.|neutral
FE9|21-WithoutAKing|Kasatai|We will win this battle! A legendary dragon of Goldoa is on our side! It is a powerful omen! Daein cannot lose! The Daein army is indestructible! We will crush the dogs of Crimea and use their skulls as goblets!|anger
FE9|28-TwistedTower|Heddwyn|This is not good... They're closing in. There are not enough Feral Ones. Someone! Anyone? Haaaalp! Go find Master Izuka at once!|fear
FE9|XX-Epilogue|Ike|Ah, King Kilvas... Despite all of your posturing, you came to our aid in the end! You turned out to be a better ally than I dared hope for.|joy
FE9|12-AStrangeLand|Ike|That's ridiculous! You're a complete--|anger
FE9|15-TheFeralFrontier|Soren|Is...is that so? How odd. Well, I can think of nothing specific that's bothering me.|surprise
FE9|16-TheAtonement|Reyson|Though the price may be my life, I will never cooperate with you!|anger
FE9|22-Solo|Soren|I wasn't able to read enough of the writing, but... I found this under the bed.|neutral
FE9|15-TheFeralFrontier|Tormod|Stop lying! I'm here because I want to be! Who's the leader of the laguz emancipation army? I am! You're a big jerk, Muarim! Trying to cover for everyone and get yourself killed? I won't allow it!|anger

FE9|16-TheAtonement|Ike|What the...? Um...who are you? How long have you been a member of my troop?|surprise
FE9|11-BloodRunsRed|Vigilante|Well, there is one condition...Once you've finished your job, you come back and see me. I'd like you to reconsider that vigilante position.|neutral

FE9|21-WithoutAKing|Tauroneo|Ah ha ha! I will cut you down with ease and leave your corpse for the rats!|anger
FE9|22-Solo|Daein Bishop|Thank you very much. I never imagined that we would be rescued by soldiers of an enemy nation.|joy
FE9|26-Clash|Ike|Reyson, is this mysterious power that you use to sense Leanne something only herons possess?|neutral

That may account for why the two of them, right from the beginning, were so warm and friendly. They gave me the support I needed to survive.

FE9|07-ShadesOfEvil|Petrine|All right, men. I’m leaving you in charge here. Don’t let even one of these Crimean vermin escape! Understood? I want them exterminated by the time I return.|anger
FE9|18-CrimeaMarches|Ike|When I was younger, I wanted nothing more than to be as strong as my father. And then I wanted to surpass him...Now, that is a goal I'll never achieve.|sadness
FE9|24-BattleReunion|Lucia|Geoffrey! I'm so glad we made it in time!|joy
FE9|17-DayBreaks|Nealuchi|Please, this is not the time to yell at a tired old man. You must hurry to Prince Reyson's side! Once he is safe, you can punish me in any way that you see fit...|fear
FE9|15-TheFeralFrontier|Ike|What on earth are you talking about?|surprise
FE9|08-DespairAndHope|Boyd|I can’t believe it! They just left, and they didn’t take one look back! Heartless scum! I’ll never forgive them!|anger
FE9|15-TheFeralFrontier|Reyson|I left no word with Tibarn. If I had known we were coming this far, I would have left a message...|neutral
FE9|11-BloodRunsRed|Lethe|...Idiot human...|anger
FE6|10B-CaughtInTheMiddle|Zinc|The Lycian Army? They would betray Etruria?!|anger
FE9|11-BloodRunsRed|Ike|Are you mad?! Your king was murdered by Daein! And now you're going to cooperate with them?|anger
FE9|07-ShadesOfEvil|Petrine|All troops, attack! Kill them! Kill them all!|anger
FE9|05-Flight|Elincia|You took me in and cared for me. I will...place my trust in you. Elincia Ridell Crimea. I am the daughter of King Ramon of Crimea.|neutral
FE9|12-AStrangeLand|Ilyana|Aren't they, though? Hee hee! I'm always happy when people notice...Whew...Wow! I feel so much better now. I'm actually starting to get hungry.|joy
FE9|17-DayBreaks|Oliver|Blast! Those wretches... They're here to steal my bird! Their souls are black with greed and jealousy! I have found beauty incarnate, and I will not relinquish it! Only I, Duke Tanas, can appreciate its worth!|anger
FE9|12-AStrangeLand|Kurthnaga|Farewell, beorc! May your journey be safe!|neutral
FE9|07-ShadesOfEvil|Balmer|And you’re having a rough time, eh? Bah! What an embarrassment.|anger
FE9|15-TheFeralFrontier|Mist|But, Ike, the other nobles we know are different! There's Princess Elincia, and King Gallia, and the dragon prince, too! All of them have been so nice and friendly and easy to talk to.|neutral
FE9|21-WithoutAKing|Petrine|Yes, Your Highness... B-by your leave...|fear
FE9|10-PrisonerRelease|Lethe|This is a ridiculous conversation! I'm leaving now.|anger
FE9|XX-Epilogue|Kieran|General, you are Crimea’s savior! For your meritorious service, I salute you! Huzzah! Nay, a thousand huzzahs!|joy
FE9|14-Training|Maid|Wha-what should I do? Ooo, he looked right angry, he did! I might get sacked!|fear
FE9|20-DefendingTalrega|Ena|Forget about me. That is my final request. Farewell...Nasir.|sadness
FE9|05-Flight|Dakova|I...don’t believe it...What went wrong...|surprise
FE9|29-Endgame|Elincia|What? Y-y-you want me to...address the troops?|surprise
FE9|12-AStrangeLand|Ike|Aye, that it is. The beast tribes of Gallia and the dragons of Goldoa seem sohonorable...and the birds of Kilvas and Phoenicis seem so cruel. It seems so easy to reduce them all to good or evil.|neutral
FE9|21-WithoutAKing|Ike|Soren! Enough!|anger
FE9|19-Entrusted|Haar|So be it. Then there's nothing left to be said. Farewell. The next time we meet, it will be as enemies. Prepare yourself... And get some rest! You know how important it is.|neutral
FE9|11-BloodRunsRed|Black Knight|It appears that our worm has been accepted as a trusted member of the company.|neutral
FE9|17-DayBreaks|Boyd|Oh, nothing... I'm just amazed...Did you know you're two times heavier than she is!? I'm glad I don't have to carry you around! It'd be like wearing an extra suit of armor!|joy
FE9|11-BloodRunsRed|Ike|You really were frightened...I'm sorry, I truly am.|sadness
FE9|XX-Epilogue|Leanne|(Thank you, our kind-hearted Beorc friends.)|joy
FE9|19-Entrusted|Volke|That's a wise decision....And in that case, I no longer need to conceal my true identity.|neutral
FE9|12-AStrangeLand|Jill|I am Jill Fizzart, wyvern rider of Daein, attached to Commander Haar's battalion. I offer a truce! I cannot sit by  and allow a human vessel to be attacked by sub-human degenerates! I will fight with you!|anger
FE6|06-TheTrap|Cath|Hey, cut it out! Let go of my arm! Ow! That hurts!|anger
FE9|13-AGuidingWind|Boyd|Nag, nag, nag. Listen, I think we should come up with an unstoppable killer attack, something only we can do!|anger
FE9|22-Solo|Ike|Yeah, thanks. Sorry for being so irritable.|neutral
FE9|21-WithoutAKing|Ike|So they're absolutely sure they'll win, is that it? King Ashnard of Daein...You'll regret underestimating us.|anger
E9|11-BloodRunsRed|Soren|Humans are shameless creatures that carelessly ignore any misfortune which does not befall them directly. They can--and often do--turn a blind eye to all manner of wickedness so long as it does not touch them or their kin.|anger
FE9|20-DefendingTalrega|Soren|...This can only mean one thing: the enemy knows exactly how we are going to move. With your permission, I'll begin an investigation to see if there's anyone suspicious among the troops......Ike?|neutral
FE9|09-Gallia|Caineghis|A prudent course of action. You look as one who would be more impulsive, but you are Greil’s son after all.|neutral
FE9|20-DefendingTalrega|Calill|Whaaaaaat?!|surprise
FE9|07-ShadesOfEvil|Greil|Stay with the king of Gallia...Live here. Live in peace...|neutral
FE9|14-Training|Ike|Princess Elincia...I... I'm sorry. My ignorance does not excuse my stupidity. ...I truly am sorry.|sadness
FE9|21-WithoutAKing|Soren|...You truly have no idea how to rule a nation. Do you know what happens to a country that loses a war? Everything is destroyed. Homes, land, crops...everything. And the citizens... They're not even treated as human.|anger
FE6|11A-TheHeroOfTheWesternIsles|Clarine|Of course! I love you, Klein.|joy
FE9|09-Gallia|Ike|Death and destruction are all part of war. My father said that a lot. The first casualties of war are those without strength and those without luck. And there’s nothing you can do about it. Live with bravery, be daring and fearless. Live for those who have died. And yet...I can’t help but think f I were more powerful...I could save more people. Couldn’t I?|sadness
FE9|22-Solo|Tomenami|What, what are you doing?|surprise
FE9|19-Entrusted|Petrine|Work with King Kilvas and put a stop to Crimea's army. No screw ups! Or else!|anger
FE6|15-TheDragonGirl|Garret|Lilina? Well, then, I’m pleased to make your acquaintance, milady.|joy
FE9|27-MomentOfFate|Nasir|You did that for a dirty traitor? Under the guise of providing information to Gallia, I gave the same information to Daein. I also took Mist's medallion and gave it to King Ashnard... And even so, you...|surprise
FE9|09-Gallia|Kotaff|Death to the rogues who defy Daein! Defend our brethren! Erase their shame!|anger
FE9|10-PrisonerRelease|Brom|What? The princess? Oh, happy day!|joy
FE9|15-TheFeralFrontier|Soren|What are YOU doing here? Are you with the sub-humans? ...Wait, did you just pop out of the sand?|surprise
FE9|11-BloodRunsRed|Norris|Stop your whining. How else am I to reward worms vile enough to sell their own princess to the enemy? Enjoy your payment, you greedy dastards! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!|anger
FE9|20-DefendingTalrega|Daein Soldier|You...traitor!|anger
FE9|27-MomentOfFate|Mist|I know that. Even so... Please? It'll only take a moment.|neutral
FE9|XX-Epilogue|Ike|Unbelievable. Despite all appearances, you’re really quite rude.|anger
FE9|XX-Epilogue|Elincia|I’m nervous. I’ve spent my whole life in hiding. No one ever taught me how to rule a kingdom. I don’t think I’m ready to be their queen. I don’t think I’m ever really going to be ready.|fear
FE9|18-CrimeaMarches|Ike|Tanith, do you have a moment?|neutral
FE9|13-AGuidingWind|Sanaki|Uh...Wh-who might you be? You don't look like a laguz. Perhaps a new recruit?|surprise
FE9|04-RoadsideBattle|Ike|It’s probably nothing to worry about. I’ll go and talk to him. Where is he?|neutral
FE9|20-DefendingTalrega|Black Knight|They are proof of the trust His Majesty has placed in me. Ena, go to the east gate. You have a visitor.|neutral
FE9|28-TwistedTower|Reyson|Tibarn is not the only one who is filled with rage. To warp the gift that the goddess has granted us...This crime shall not go unpunished! Yaaaaa!!|anger
FE9|25-StrangeLands|Calill|Oh... He's such a clown. But you made a good hire. After all, he's a world-class--|neutral
FE9|25-StrangeLands|Largo|Hey! I thought I'd find you here, Calill! You're looking hot! Almost as hot as me! Bwaaa ha ha ha haaaaaa!|joy
FE9|01-TheBattleBegins|Boyd|Oscar! Dang it! You didn’t have to bring that up!|anger
FE6|16x-ThePinnacleOfLight|Soldier|B-But Bishop Windham! If we use those, they may hit our allies as well!|fear
FE9|17-DayBreaks|Tibarn|It doesn't matter! Claiming ignorance does not grant you innocence. You treated Reyson like a trinket in a public market!|anger
FE9|17-DayBreaks|Janaff|What's going on, you old buzzard? King Kilvas is the White Prince's friend, isn't he?|surprise
FE9|14-Training|Naesala|Ha! Is that not always the way of Phoenicis, to cling to those last tattered remnants of pride? Instead of proclaiming that you will attack none but Begnion ships, just admit that you don't have the power to do more!|anger
FE9|12-AStrangeLand|Mist|I have to say, at first, I was scared, too. When I saw how they could change...They can do things that we hu--I mean, we beorc can't do. They're not like us...|fear
FE9|22-Solo|Elincia|Soren, you're being so rude! Surely the apostle, of all people, would never do such a thing!|anger
FE9|17-DayBreaks|Ike|Curses! They just keep coming! How many soldiers does he have?|anger
FE9|24-BattleReunion|Elincia|No... No! They've survived this long! They're alive! NO!!!|anger
FE9|02-Rescue|Rhys|Not more than a little while ago, I went out for a walk around the yard and...A man I’ve never seen before came up to me and said...Give this to the red-tressed knight.|neutral
FE9|08-DespairAndHope|Ike|They’re fine, they’re fine! In fact, we’ve all come to an agreement, and they’re traveling with us now. I don’t see any reason we should go on fighting. If you’re with them, we can protect you from Daein.|neutral
FE9|19-Entrusted|Soren|No matter what we decide, sitting here like this is giving the enemy more time to prepare.|neutral
FE9|09-Gallia|Lethe|This is a beorc fight. If you don’t Direct us, then we have no reason for being here. So spoke our king.|neutral
FE9|11-BloodRunsRed|Ashnard|Pah. Nonsense. Our only concern is the princess of Crimea and the medallion. We must wait and watch until such time as we can strike.|anger
FE9|XX-Epilogue|Bastian|Oh, glorious day of sweet victory! Praises upon the day the goddess did see fit to send Sir Ike to save our land.|joy
FE9|13-AGuidingWind|Rolf|I told you, don't call me that!|anger
FE9|04-RoadsideBattle|Soren|I would. Daein’s troops are superior in both numbers and morale. The chances of a Crimean victory are slim indeed.|neutral
FE9|27-MomentOfFate|Mist|It was all I could think about. But...But I didn't want to think about it anymore. It made my head hurt. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't even sleep. I would just lie awake at night and stare at the tent walls.|sadness
FE9|06-ABriefDiversion|Titania|Right. So enough of your griping. You’re merely wasting energy. Still, this heat is appalling.|anger
FE9|14-Training|Elincia|No. I...What you said, you said in my defense and in my honor. It made me very pleased.|joy
FE9|17-DayBreaks|Begnion Soldier|But, Your Grace, they serve at the pleasure of the apostle herself! Striking them would be--|fear
FE9|22-Solo|Schaeferr|Gahar har har! Gahar har har har! See? You ain't so useless after all!|anger
FE9|05-Flight|Elincia|Master Greil, my lord Ike, you said that you were mercenaries, did you not? Please...Would you help me to gain Gallia? I beg of you! I have...no one...no one else to turn to.|sadness
FE9|09-Gallia|Elincia|My lord Ike, King Caineghis has advised me to turn to the Begnion Theocracy for aid in Crimea’s restoration. He says we should make of Begnion a formal request and gain the support of their shields.|neutral
FE9|14-Training|Sigrun|It appears that the apostle will handle your payment on the morrow. Perhaps you can speak with her then.I beg your leave. I must be going.|neutral
FE9|23-TheGreatBridge|Petrine|Y-Your... Your Majesty...Forgive me...please... Oh, I don't want to die... So...scared...|fear
FE9|14-Training|Ike|That's madness! They would sacrifice a whole country to satisfy their own egos?|anger
FE9|28-TwistedTower|Ena|...Hm? Yes, of course. That is why I provide accurate information.|neutral
FE9|17-DayBreaks|Oliver|Oh! Oh! Oh! I've found you at last! My beautiful treasure!|joy
FE9|29-Endgame|Rajaion|You were made...to suffer...because of me... I'm sorry.|sadness
FE9|17-DayBreaks|Sigrun|I'm sorry... I'm just so happy...|joy
FE9|21-WithoutAKing|Ena|Let's return to the topic at hand. The king has gained himself a new castle, and I believe he considers whatever land he occupies to be his kingdom. Daein and its people are already behind him. He need not look back.|neutral
FE9|19-Entrusted|Naesala|So, we're friends again? Come to Kilvas for a visit, will you? Nealuchi will be so pleased.|joy
FE9|16-TheAtonement|Sanaki|It's all right, Princess Elincia. He speaks the truth, be it with a sharpened tongue or no.|neutral
FE9|02-Rescue|Mist|Eeek!|fear
FE9|13-AGuidingWind|Soren|I...I ought to apologize for that.|sadness
FE6|16-RetakingTheCapital|Narcian|Rubbish! Me, demoted!? And my replacement is that Galle...! Never! I will never allow that to happen! B-But what can I do... No...! My honor, my status... It’s all collapsing!|sadness
FE9|18-CrimeaMarches|Sanaki|You have done excellent work, Ike. Thanks to you, the wound that has scarred Begnion for many long years can finally begin to heal.|joy
FE9|09-Gallia|Ike|Are you serious?|surprise
FE9|09-Gallia|Soren|Thank you, Commander. I will do my best. But if I have your leave, I must be going.|neutral
FE9|16-TheAtonement|Sanaki|What? You! What are you doing? How dare you approach me unannounced! This is most inappropriate, and I will not--|anger
FE9|16-TheAtonement|Sanaki|I am. However, whether I succeed or fail depends largely on what you do next.|neutral
FE9|28-TwistedTower|Nealuchi|Oh! What a glorious sight...You look so much like your dear, departed mother...Sniff...|sadness
FE9|11-BloodRunsRed|Haar|Yawn. Go entertain yourself, will you? Fight a soldier or lance a peasant or...what you will. But for the love of flying, stop interrupting my sleep!|anger
FE9|13-AGuidingWind|Ike|And yet you soldiers sneer at mercenaries. At least we fight for something real. There are some dumb soldiers in this world.|anger
FE9|10-PrisonerRelease|Sephiran|Pardon me...May I have a moment of your time?|neutral
FE9|18-CrimeaMarches|Kayachey|Those sub-human freaks! Let's use them as bait. We can sacrifice them and reduce our own human casualties.|anger
FE9|15-TheFeralFrontier|Ike|We're mercenaries. We were hired to take care of a group of bandits operating in this area.|neutral
FE9|17-DayBreaks|Mist|Really? I guess it was just me then.|neutral
FE6|13-RescueMission|Narcian|Cecilia...! That bitch again! Always interfering with my plans...!|anger
FE9|19-Entrusted|Volke|He didn't want you to lose yourself and go hunting for revenge, I suppose. He was killed much, much sooner than he ever expected to be.|neutral
FE9|23-TheGreatBridge|Soren|Ike is...in a war meeting. If you have something for him, I can hold on to it for you.|neutral
FE9|02-Rescue|Bandit|Heh heh heh...All right, so now you’re all unarmed. Which means...all you can do is watch while I gut this whiny brat like a fatling pig!|anger
FE9|10-PrisonerRelease|Marcia|And so we put this guy right here, and this dealy-bobber goes there...and we're finished!|neutral
FE9|07-ShadesOfEvil|Black Knight|I won’t check my hand again. Give me what I am after. If you offer no more resistance, I will leave your child alive.|neutral
